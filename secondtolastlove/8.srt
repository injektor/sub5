1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,000
Wait.

2
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,760
Sang Sik.

3
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,230
Do you...

4
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
like me?

5
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,860
What are you talking about?

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,500
I asked you if you like me.

7
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,760
Why would you ask me that all of a sudden?

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Is it too sudden?

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,190
Whether I like someone or not,

10
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,300
it's not important at all.

11
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,330
Nothing will change.

12
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
Why not?

13
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,630
Even if I like someone,

14
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,300
it won't change anything in my life.

15
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,750
That's why there is no point in liking someone...

16
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,030
or not liking someone.

17
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,930
It's all meaningless.

18
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,430
I understand what you mean.

19
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,330
Of course,

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,490
I think that way sometimes, too.

21
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,230
I sometimes think that I'm too old to fall in love.

22
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,930
However,

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,630
you won't know if it'll change your life or not unless you try it.

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,930
Even if your life doesn't change a lot,

25
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,800
your heart can change.

26
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,330
What's wrong with liking someone?

27
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,360
To think that I won't have those kinds of feelings again...

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,900
makes me feel sorry for myself.

29
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,810
I'm not sure.

30
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm used to this life already.

31
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,200
I decided not to live like that any more.

32
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,200
Just like the dramas I make,

33
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,200
I'll like someone as much as I want when I do.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,260
I'll wait for him with butterflies in my stomach.

35
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,460
When I hold his hand,

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,260
my heart will race. I might even get jealous.

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,000
That's what I plan on doing.

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,830
That's...

39
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,300
You're single and unmarried, so that's possible.

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,930
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden anyway?

41
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,800
Take this injury for example.

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,900
Why would you put your life on the line with the horse going wild?

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,460
Is this...

44
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,040
just you doing your job again?

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,130
Isn't it a human instinct...

46
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,360
to help those in trouble?

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,060
Are you saying that...

48
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,200
you don't have...

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,700
any feelings for me?

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,470
Well,

51
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,330
it's natural for a man to help a woman in need.

52
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,530
Helping a neighbour is...

53
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,230
a duty and also common sense.

54
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,030
I'm glad.

55
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,850
I was worried that...

56
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,330
I might feel pressured if you actually liked me.

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,330
Why would you worry about that?

58
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,850
I didn't want us to be awkward.

59
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,690
You're the strange one to feel awkward with me.

60
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,460
Maybe you're the one who has feelings for me.

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,330
No way.

62
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,430
Gosh.

63
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,030
That was harsh.

64
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,760
Since I hate being awkward, let's be friends.

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,210
- Friends?
 -  What's wrong?

66
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,700
You don't think a man and a woman can become friends?

67
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,230
Don't tell me you're that old fashioned.

68
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm not that bad.

69
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,360
Good.

70
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,070
Here.

71
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,930
Let's be friends.

72
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,900
Gosh.

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,300
Seriously?

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,600
(Second to Last Love)

75
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,760
(Episode 8)

76
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,330
Friends?

77
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,930
We're friends?

78
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,430
Hold on.

79
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,700
My goodness, I didn't know that.

80
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,330
Cheers.

81
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,660
What should I do?

82
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,100
She doesn't even remember it.

83
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,460
This is huge problem.

84
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,530
They grew up a lot, didn't they?

85
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,680
Yes.

86
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,410
I was here with Jun Woo when Ha Ni was born,

87
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,830
but she's a mum now.

88
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,560
Time sure flies.

89
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,500
All of my horses here grew up healthy thanks to Chief Ko.

90
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,560
He paid a lot of attention to us.

91
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,130
I'm so thankful.

92
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm also growing up well thanks to my brother.

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,940
Are you still friends with Jun Woo?

94
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,960
Of course.

95
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,320
You two were friends since you were small,

96
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,630
but you're adults now.

97
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,980
Don't you guys have something going on?

98
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,690
No way.

99
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,480
You know what we're like.

100
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,160
You never know.

101
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,100
There's Jun Woo.

102
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,830
Hey, Ko Mi Rae.

103
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,960
- Hello, Sir.
 -  Hey.

104
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,490
I made this. Have some.

105
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,030
You always bring me food.

106
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,430
Hurry up and take her.

107
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,000
Of course I want her around,

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,510
but her brother will be worried.

109
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,130
Okay, I'll snatch her away.

110
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,130
Why did you come? I told you not to.

111
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,030
Hey, Ha Ni.

112
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,400
You're so big now.

113
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,600
You should have brought some alcohol.

114
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,120
Do you want some? I can get some right now.

115
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,200
Forget it.

116
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,600
What happened at the broadcasting station?

117
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,260
It took a lot for Sang Sik to agree to this.

118
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,160
Are you really not going back?

119
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,600
It's awkward not to go back after hearing Min Joo's story.

120
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,430
What did she tell you?

121
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,800
Min Joo...

122
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,900
seems to have a broken past.

123
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,600
A broken past?

124
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,470
- Min Joo does?
 -  Don't ask me any more.

125
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,060
Of course she has a past at her age. You do, too.

126
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,800
Forget it. I'm done.

127
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,560
What? You hardly ate.

128
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,500
What are you doing? Let's go home.

129
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,120
That smells.

130
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,780
It's a stable. What do you expect?

131
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,280
Do you like it that much here?

132
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,420
Why not go to a hotel?

133
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,140
I don't have money for that.

134
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,910
I like it here. It puts my mind at ease.

135
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,910
You're like a filly.

136
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,670
I'm more experienced than you think.

137
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,700
You little...

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,400
Just leave. I'm going to sleep. I'm tired.

139
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,560
What a troublemaker.

140
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,070
Gosh.

141
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,100
What do you think you're doing?

142
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,470
I'm going to take a break before going back.

143
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,360
This isn't some hotel.

144
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,100
I guess you're an adult now.

145
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,630
You used to tell me everything whenever we came here.

146
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,100
I want to be alone.

147
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,230
I guess today isn't the day.

148
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,730
Don't make us worry so much. Come back tomorrow morning, okay?

149
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,830
Got it?

150
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,060
I got it.

151
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,170
I wanted to congratulate you on your job.

152
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,360
I was happy to see you finally work on something...

153
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,260
you really enjoy.

154
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,800
I really wanted to tell you that.

155
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,720
What are you making? It smells so good.

156
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,450
I made abalone porridge for Min Joo.

157
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,650
She's so lucky. She gets to have Jun Woo's porridge.

158
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,060
It's nothing.

159
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,040
I made a lot, so have some for dinner tonight.

160
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,500
All right. You should go see her since she's alone at the hospital.

161
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,590
Okay.

162
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,320
Aunt Mi Rae didn't come home last night.

163
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,730
- I know.
 -  What happened?

164
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,830
She started working with our neighbour, didn't she?

165
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,930
Is she working overtime already?

166
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,800
Ask Mi Rae yourself.

167
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,300
Honey, please drop off Hoon.

168
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,500
Why won't you have breakfast? You look so down.

169
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,530
Give me my bag.

170
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,130
This? Here you go.

171
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,260
- I'll be back.
 -  Okay.

172
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,760
- Bye.
 -  Bye.

173
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,190
Have a good day.

174
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,970
Good luck!

175
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,030
- Thank you.
 -  Bye.

176
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Min Joo.

177
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,490
My goodness. Why did you come?

178
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,560
You should rest for a few more days. Why are you getting discharged?

179
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,130
I even made porridge for you.

180
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,500
Why did you go see Mi Rae yesterday?

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,560
You need to rest.

182
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,680
I'm fine now.

183
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,730
Let's go.

184
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,720
We have lots of time, so we'll take it slow.

185
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,340
I better go to the office.

186
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,360
Like that?

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,460
No, not today. I won't allow it.

188
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,660
Who was the man that stayed with me when I was sick?

189
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,430
Eun Ho.

190
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm reminded of Eun Ho when I look at Jun Woo.

191
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,060
Even including all of my feelings from back then.

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,830
What is it? Does it hurt somewhere?

193
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
No.

194
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,040
The local tourist department will focus on the city promotion,

195
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,900
while developing tourist attractions.

196
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,900
As for the drama project,

197
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,360
Head Chief Shin will spearhead it.

198
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,640
Great work.

199
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,930
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

200
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Thank you.

201
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,600
Chief Ko. Take a look at this.

202
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,800
The business support department got a bonus...

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
for working on the Woori Grape Festival.

204
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,400
My staff think your team should take it...

205
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,740
for a team dinner since you worked hard on the ground that day.

206
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,440
Team dinner? No, thank you.

207
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,930
Come on. It was raining cats and dogs,

208
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,620
and you guys worked so hard on it. Take it.

209
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,360
Are you looking into the internal spy that made a deal with...

210
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,660
a company that sells cheaper imports instead of our city's grapes?

211
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,200
Chief Ko, what are you talking about?

212
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,380
If you're too busy, I can ask the police for you.

213
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,700
Go head. I hope you do.

214
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,200
You won't take this bonus, then?

215
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,330
I'd rather not take it to avoid getting on your boat.

216
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,530
What? What did you say?

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
On what grounds are you saying this?

218
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,360
- Chief Ko.
 -  Yes?

219
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,060
Are you saying the culprit...

220
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,980
behind switching the grapes during the festival is...

221
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,400
You should stay out of it.

222
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,500
Is this going to be all right?

223
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,900
You're not young any more.

224
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,830
If you keep this up, a promotion is out of the question.

225
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,360
Half of our middle-aged lives are full of failures anyway.

226
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,600
It's not so bad to age like this.

227
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,730
What's with the head chief anyway?

228
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,530
Starting today, it's the real thing.

229
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,310
I'm nervous to do it in front of our citizens.

230
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,650
I'm confident. I think it'll be fun.

231
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,990
Here's yours.

232
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,100
- Thank you.
 -  Good luck.

233
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,910
Shall we head out?

234
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,030
- Yes!
 -  Yes!

235
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,660
(Happiness Concert)

236
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,760
- Hello.
 -  Welcome.

237
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,290
What's going on?

238
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,230
As you can see, we decided to go with...

239
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,400
the strings quartet for the promotional event for this year.

240
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,210
You can go back to your desks.

241
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,770
But Head Chief Shin, we worked really hard.

242
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,630
Did you say Ms Han Song Yi wrote the song?

243
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,910
Yes, Sir.

244
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,420
This is why you're on contract.

245
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,170
You'll never become full time at this rate.

246
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,450
If you don't want to be kicked out before your contract is up,

247
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,840
you should be more creative...

248
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,630
instead coming up with things like that.

249
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,910
What you just said is an insult to my staff, and an act of contempt.

250
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,480
That's why you should stop bothering us and go back in.

251
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,560
This is an order!

252
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
No, Chief Ko.

253
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,640
How can you go to work like that?

254
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,330
You should go to work, too. People will be upset if you're closed.

255
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,260
I have someone working there.

256
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,650
Do you? That's a relief.

257
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not sure if it's a relief.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,310
What do you mean?

259
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,660
There's something about it.

260
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,400
I'll tell you later.

261
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,920
What about Mi Rae? Did she say anything?

262
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,260
Don't worry about her.

263
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,430
I bet she'll go back.

264
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,170
How do you know that?

265
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,860
I grew up with her. Of course I know.

266
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,800
I see.

267
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,990
You two must be close.

268
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,330
Don't misunderstand, though.

269
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,700
We're just friends.

270
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Friends?

271
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,460
Can a man and a woman...

272
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,010
be friends?

273
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,060
Of course.

274
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,460
All right.

275
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,700
I think so, too.

276
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,460
Go have some of the porridge at home, and take it easy at work.

277
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,800
Okay. I will.

278
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,560
Song Yi.

279
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,370
Even though I'm a contract worker,

280
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,930
I was proud of my job, and I did my best.

281
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,430
I know.

282
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,340
What do you know?

283
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,130
You don't know anything.

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,700
On your first day here,

285
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,890
I know you stayed behind after everyone left...

286
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,130
so that you could study our work processes.

287
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,930
I also know that you come in earlier than others...

288
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,260
to clean their desks.

289
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,730
You're also the one behind stocking up our supplies.

290
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,900
Even during the grape festival, I know you were...

291
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,630
more tedious than me at picking out the products.

292
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,930
Chief Ko...

293
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,530
I know it all. So don't let someone like him hurt you.

294
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,130
But...

295
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,200
I've closed my heart on you, too.

296
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,870
Me?

297
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,630
During the grape festival,

298
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,370
I saw you run away...

299
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,600
in the rain...

300
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,460
with SBC's Producer Kang Min Joo.

301
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,230
What?

302
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Run!

303
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,460
That's because there was so much rain.

304
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,120
I mean, why do I have to explain this to you?

305
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
You guys aren't what I think you are, right?

306
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,670
Tell me you're not.

307
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,300
No, it's not like that.

308
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,330
Then what was it?

309
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,130
It was just...

310
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,370
We're just neighbours and friends.

311
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,260
Friends?

312
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
Yes.

313
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,800
Chief Ko.

314
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,110
I had no idea.

315
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,310
Song Yi.

316
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,430
Song Yi, please...

317
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Someone will see us.

318
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,430
- Chief Ko.
 -  Song Yi.

319
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,870
Song Yi, don't do this. We're at work.

320
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,930
- Song Yi, please.
 -  My goodness.

321
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,610
Song Yi.

322
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,660
Hold on.

323
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,330
Producer Kang.

324
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,930
Producer Kang.

325
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,630
Mi Rae.

326
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,720
I can't believe you're here on your crutches.

327
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,410
You should have took more time off.

328
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,470
There's no time for that. We better hurry back after we eat.

329
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,380
This is what Ae Ri wrote, and this is what I reorganised.

330
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,670
Hold on.

331
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,000
Before we proceed, tell me why I have to...

332
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,460
work with Ko Mi Rae.

333
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,380
She may look sloppy and incompetent...

334
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,760
on the outside.

335
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,730
However, her perspective towards people...

336
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
is so warm and beautiful.

337
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,600
I want to steal it away from her.

338
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,330
Then what is it that she has and I don't?

339
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,630
I see.

340
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,200
Being unsanitary?

341
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,930
No.

342
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,160
She's curious about things no one cares about.

343
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,030
Observational skills.

344
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,660
You're actually pretty cute.

345
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,400
- How old are you?
 -  35 years old.

346
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,200
You look really young for your age.

347
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Then...

348
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,130
I'm older than you.

349
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,580
Why are you lying? You guys are the same age.

350
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,630
Gosh.

351
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,640
Who cares about age at work?

352
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,730
Writer Ko, you can just call him Producer Nam.

353
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,870
I'm not an official writer yet.

354
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Okay, Producer Nam.

355
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,660
All right, let's start the meeting as we eat.

356
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,730
Look right here.

357
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,370
Yes?

358
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,830
Mi Rae went back to work?

359
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,130
No, I'm glad.

360
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
Okay.

361
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,530
How long has it been? It's so nice to see you.

362
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,380
What brings you here?

363
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,630
Why do you think? I'm here for the city drama project.

364
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,860
What a nice place you work at. Why didn't you tell me?

365
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,640
Are you saying the famous Na Joo Yeon...

366
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,660
is on Producer Han's drama?

367
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,640
- Yes.
 -  How can he do that?

368
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,170
You used to be his assistant. He wants to beat you so badly.

369
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,330
Gosh.

370
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,600
If they get picked, is it finished for us?

371
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,060
- Bingo.
 -  Who is Producer Han?

372
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,860
It's him right there.

373
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,300
Producer Kang. I heard you were in the hospital.

374
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,330
Are you okay?

375
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,250
You should have rested longer.

376
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,070
- Let's go work.
 -  Okay.

377
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,100
Okay.

378
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,930
Writer Ko.

379
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,430
I thought you packed up and left.

380
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,600
Did something happen?

381
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,760
Not at all.

382
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,730
You're not a coward like someone I know.

383
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,230
Good luck.

384
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
A coward?

385
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,400
I plan on doing that.

386
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,080
There's someone I want to beat.

387
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,100
Who?

388
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,910
- Me?
 -  We'll see...

389
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,830
who gets the drama project.

390
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,600
Good day.

391
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,800
She's just like her brother.

392
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,800
Give me the money to repair the camera.

393
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,750
- What if I don't?
 -  Come on, it's not much.

394
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,560
If it's not much, why are you asking me for it?

395
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,130
53 dollars is a lot of money for me.

396
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,230
You're the first student to rip money off of me.

397
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,260
- Here.
 -  Gosh.

398
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,030
I said, no discounts.

399
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,210
Three dollars.

400
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,640
I don't have change.

401
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,020
Even delivery makes us fight when we sell used products.

402
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,300
- Delivery?
 -  Delivery fee included.

403
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,550
You're lucky I'm not taking interest.

404
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,600
Hey.

405
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm Hoon. Park Hoon.

406
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
Yes?

407
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,360
He can't come to dinner?

408
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,230
Of course something came up.

409
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,760
I have a life too, you know.

410
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,080
No, no.

411
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,510
I don't want to meet someone like him again.

412
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,660
I'm hanging up.

413
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,300
You got dumped.

414
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,200
Are you still single?

415
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,560
Just focus on your book.

416
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
What's wrong?

417
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Is this...

418
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
made by the owner here?

419
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,900
Why do you ask?

420
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,470
It's a little salty.

421
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,530
Oh, no.

422
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,550
How did you know?

423
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,560
Did you...

424
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,400
make this?

425
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,830
I told you not to take customers without me.

426
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,430
Hey, how can you leave your store like that?

427
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Hello.

428
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,300
What are you doing?

429
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,900
I'm sorry, Sir.

430
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,460
It was break time, so I was cleaning when a customer came.

431
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,930
Hey, what is going on?

432
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,100
You should feel thankful...

433
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,800
that she's making business while you're away.

434
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,170
Why are you abusing your power on this beautiful young lady?

435
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,730
I'm not.

436
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,930
He is.

437
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,480
He's abusing his power because I like him more.

438
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,560
Ji Sun.

439
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,460
Anyway,

440
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,500
you're always leaving the store these days.

441
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,370
What's gotten into you?

442
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,010
What are you talking about?

443
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,360
He's right.

444
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,830
Your next door neighbour.

445
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,570
Kang Min Joo.

446
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,830
Am I right?

447
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,800
Who? Your next door neighbour?

448
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Come with me.

449
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,660
His next door neighbour? She came to my bar before.

450
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,530
What do we do with Sang Sik?

451
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,670
What's wrong with you?

452
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,980
I'm just saying the truth so that there aren't any misunderstandings.

453
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,440
He seemed close with you.

454
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,660
If you keep this up, you'll be out in a day, not a month. Understand?

455
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,130
You said you wouldn't get involved even if I like...

456
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,930
my neighbour or anybody else.

457
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,840
You said you would just remain as a friend.

458
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,500
That's right, I won't get involved.

459
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,740
I won't.

460
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,530
I'm happy as it is now.

461
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,060
I'm happy to see your face every day.

462
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,330
Now, I can finally breathe again.

463
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,460
You're obsessed.

464
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,130
If you want to get away from me, stop thinking that way.

465
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,300
I'm trying, too.

466
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,380
I'm thankful that you let me stay here.

467
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,230
Don't say anything stupid to other people.

468
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,760
If you do that again,

469
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,560
I won't go easy next time.

470
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,930
Remember that.

471
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,330
He's still at it with her?

472
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,660
Hello, Min Joo.

473
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,270
What happened to your knee?

474
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,300
Your cartilage?

475
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
The emotional shock must be bigger.

476
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,980
That's why you need to exercise a lot.

477
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,350
I haven't seen you at the gym.

478
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,320
Working out can't stop you from ageing.

479
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,700
You can't stop it, but you can delay it.

480
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,880
Look at that.

481
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,510
That sushi has been going around forever.

482
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,800
This is the fifth time.

483
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,930
It looks like me.

484
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,280
I went on countless blind dates and job interviews,

485
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,510
and now I'm old and wilted.

486
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,700
No one would ever choose me any more.

487
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,400
In the end, I'll go bad and get thrown out.

488
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,460
- Gosh.
 -  Goodness.

489
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,700
I thought I would never come down from my high heels.

490
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,910
Now that I'm older, I don't care about fashion.

491
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,130
I love low and comfortable shoes.

492
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,730
I ask myself what I've been doing, too.

493
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,230
I'm just as lost as I was in my teenage years.

494
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,370
If I'm this old, it should be different from then.

495
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,600
But I'm still worried about the same problems.

496
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,300
It feels unfair.

497
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,600
I'm afraid this will last until I die.

498
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,800
We should at least marry before we die.

499
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,920
No, no.

500
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,410
Marriage isn't the answer. No way.

501
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,660
Then at least let me date.

502
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,800
How is it going with your next door neighbour?

503
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,710
- Which one?
 -  My goodness.

504
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,400
Of course it's Jun Woo. Why would I talk about the civil servant?

505
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,400
Min Joo. It's about Jun Woo.

506
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,160
I'll only tell you what I saw.

507
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,930
Do you remember the mysterious woman I told you about before?

508
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,030
I saw her working at his cafe.

509
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,700
She was all over him.

510
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,500
She begged him to let her stay in his life.

511
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,530
She looked really into him.

512
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,730
His past lover?

513
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,330
That's suspicious.

514
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,200
I guess that's what he meant earlier.

515
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,980
Did you know?

516
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,800
He told me that he would tell me later.

517
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,640
I thought you were finally getting to date.

518
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,230
Nothing is easy.

519
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,080
I wonder if Min Joo...

520
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,260
is planning to marry Jun Woo if things go well with him?

521
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,300
Why don't you ask her directly if you're that curious?

522
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,270
All of these boys look the same to me.

523
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,460
That is not true at all.

524
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,730
Bigbang.

525
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,830
G-Dragon, Tae Yang, Dae Sung,

526
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,130
Seung Ri and T.O.P. There are five members.

527
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,060
T.O.P is the name of the drink. It's pronounced as "Top".

528
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,430
I know, "Top".

529
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,750
This is read as "Bap".

530
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,760
It's B.A.P.

531
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,780
Gosh, E.X.O has so many members.

532
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,800
It's EXO.

533
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,530
You should've studied English this hard when you were in school.

534
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,180
When I said T.O.P, you corrected me and said it's "Top".

535
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,520
So I read B.A.P as "Bap", and you said it's B.A.P.

536
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,060
Then I said it's E.X.O, and you're saying it's EXO.

537
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,200
What do you want me to do, seriously?

538
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,760
This is exactly why Ye Ji can't talk to you and thinks...

539
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,920
you're incapable of love.

540
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,550
You think love is like cancer, don't you?

541
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,180
I'm trying, okay?

542
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,060
All mums think of those boys as their own sons and love them.

543
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,500
Do you not do any housework at home and watch TV all day?

544
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,400
Stop wasting your time and look after Hoon.

545
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,600
On that note,

546
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,000
I want to talk to you about taking out a loan under your name...

547
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,450
to send Hoon to a school in China.

548
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,630
Gosh, I'm so sick of this. You're going on about it again.

549
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,760
I'm sick and tired of this. My goodness.

550
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,500
Yes. I'm coming to pick up my laptop now.

551
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,430
Goodness.

552
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,430
My gosh!

553
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,910
What are you doing now?

554
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,700
Don't make me talk because this won't be easy.

555
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,060
Let me down. I'm heavy. What if we end up rolling down together?

556
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,930
It's exhausting, isn't it?

557
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Yes.

558
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Park Jun Woo.

559
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,900
I like hearing you calling my name.

560
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,730
Shall we...

561
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,300
try seeing each other?

562
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,800
While making so many romantic dramas and melodramas,

563
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,310
I've realised that our reality can't be like dramas.

564
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,100
Whether it's love knocking on your door...

565
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,760
or you falling passionately in love, love doesn't come by easily in life.

566
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,930
Love shines the most when it's between two young people,

567
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,030
and that's still the kind of dramas I make.

568
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,670
That area isn't good for education, so the real estate prices are bad.

569
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,810
By the way, what kind of supplements do you take these days?

570
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,920
I don't take any supplements.

571
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,120
Everyone goes to yoga classes to lose weight,

572
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,510
but I think walking is the best.

573
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,390
Especially hiking. It's excellent.

574
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,500
Which mountain do you go to?

575
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,630
The little hill in front of my house.

576
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,460
For people in my generation, love has lost its place in our hearts...

577
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,800
before we even realised it.

578
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,630
However, I regained the desire to be in love again.

579
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,160
It's because coming across someone who likes me this much...

580
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,260
may never happen again in my life.

581
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,230
You really meant what you said earlier, right?

582
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,860
Then we're a couple now.

583
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,930
Well, what I meant was...

584
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,170
that we should spend more time together...

585
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,390
to get to know each other better.

586
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,060
It's the same thing.

587
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,130
No, it's different.

588
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,530
How is it different?

589
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,160
You need to be with the person to get to know him or her better.

590
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,830
Is there a generation gap between us or what?

591
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,470
Being with the person means that you're in a relationship.

592
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,860
Getting to know each other is...

593
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,930
What is it? Just testing the waters?

594
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,770
Being able to get out of it easily if things don't go well?

595
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,700
Yes, something like that.

596
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,830
You need to learn more about me,

597
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,130
and I also don't know a lot about you yet.

598
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,730
So you're scared.

599
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,100
What?

600
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,270
What you're saying is that you're scared of jumping in.

601
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,270
Yes, I admit.

602
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,690
You'll find out when you're older.

603
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,300
Meeting new people isn't easy.

604
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,710
Getting into a relationship is even more difficult.

605
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,370
Why do things become more difficult as we age?

606
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,160
Shouldn't things become easier as we get older?

607
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,920
With age, we gain experience and ability to make better decisions.

608
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,480
We also learn to trust our intuition,

609
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,130
so you should be able to know right away...

610
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,200
whether you're meant to be with the person or not.

611
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,630
So what do you think?

612
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,230
You're so handsome.

613
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,160
Gosh, seriously.

614
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,210
I'm quite good-looking, aren't I?

615
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,230
Goodness.

616
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,790
Tae Yang, Seung Ri, T.O.P,

617
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,730
Dae Sung and G-Dragon. Bigbang.

618
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,040
- Hello! Have a great day.
 -  Hello.

619
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,000
Hello. Good morning.

620
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,530
Block B has... Right. Block B's members are Zico, Tae Il,

621
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,360
Jae Hyo, B-Bomb, P.O...

622
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
P.O...

623
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,330
Gosh, what are they doing in the car?

624
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,030
(This car was just washed. Keep a safe distance.)

625
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,270
EXO... EXO has...

626
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,860
(Let's sing "Woori City Song" together.)

627
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,930
All right. Will everyone be able to do it here?

628
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,280
What can we do? We have no choice.

629
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,530
Song Yi, best of luck.

630
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,020
Thank you.

631
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,880
All right, everyone. If we give up,

632
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,230
"Woori City Song" will disappear into history forever.

633
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,530
Yes. If our performance doesn't get any feedback, that will be it.

634
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,200
Let's think of this as our last chance and do our very best.

635
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,860
We're like independence fighters.

636
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,430
A secret organisation.

637
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,350
Let's do this. Let's march on, fight and win. We can do it.

638
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,460
- Okay.
 -  Sure.

639
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,880
- Let's march on, fight and win.
 -  Let's march on, fight and win.

640
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,030
- We can do it!
 -  We can do it!

641
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,800
Producer Kang!

642
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,810
Hello.

643
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,930
Where are your crutches?

644
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,130
I'm better now.

645
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,530
Are you really okay now?

646
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,110
If not, I can just use the crutches or get hospitalised again.

647
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,480
No, you have to work with me.

648
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,800
I overcame my indecisiveness and decided to do this with you.

649
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Thanks for saying that.

650
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,560
I really mean it.

651
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Knowing that someone needs me made me so happy.

652
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,890
I always felt that not many people can understand me,

653
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,560
but I feel like I have someone on my side now.

654
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,900
I'm grateful to know that my sincerity reached out to you.

655
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,770
Also, I wanted to talk to you about Jun Woo.

656
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,650
He seems immature and carefree,

657
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,400
but he actually has a mature soul who has an wounded heart.

658
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,380
He feels lonely easily, too.

659
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,830
He doesn't fall for someone easily, either.

660
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,360
Hearing that he's into someone...

661
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,770
makes me so happy and grateful...

662
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,500
"You should be good to him." That's what you want to say, right?

663
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,630
Yes. I'm sure you'll be good to him, but I just wanted to...

664
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,730
Jun Woo is very lucky...

665
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,930
to have such a great friend like you.

666
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,300
No. We fought and beat up each other while growing up together.

667
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,630
He's like the bane of my existence.

668
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,240
Hey, Jun Woo!

669
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,250
Look at this. I like seeing the two of you leaving work together.

670
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,990
You should've called.

671
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,860
I was worried that you'd decide to work for longer if I called.

672
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,860
I'll take the subway.

673
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,990
You're so smart.

674
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,720
Why? Join us for dinner.

675
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,830
- No.
 -  I don't want to.

676
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,330
See you later.

677
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,060
But...

678
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,060
Get home safely!

679
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,460
Bye!

680
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,600
Shall we get going, too?

681
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,230
I feel so sorry.

682
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,460
My new neighbourhood is a strange place.

683
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,270
I don't feel alone even when I'm by myself.

684
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,730
I feel as though I'm with people even when I'm alone.

685
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,700
There's more humanism than melodrama.

686
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,830
That's what this neighbourhood is like.

687
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,200
- Let's support Woori City together.
 -  Let's sing together.

688
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,730
Woori City is the best!

689
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,300
- The forest has a nice breeze
 -  The forest has a nice breeze.

690
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,100
Let's sing together!

691
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,560
I judged you by your looks and didn't think you'd be this friendly.

692
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,060
What do I look like?

693
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,480
You look like you've never had to lift a finger.

694
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,270
You look destined to live a comfortable life.

695
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,900
I met Jun Woo, so I could be...

696
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,200
happy for the rest of my life.

697
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,970
Why is Jun Woo so cold to you by the way?

698
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,330
I mean, you're so good to him.

699
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,210
I guess he doesn't like me.

700
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,820
What are you talking about? You two looked so lovely together...

701
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,900
when you visited him a year ago.

702
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,770
Things can chance overnight in romantic relationships, you know?

703
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,880
You sound so knowledgeable.

704
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,660
He's treating me like that now,

705
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,570
but I guess things will get better soon.

706
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,360
You're optimistic, too. I like that.

707
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,430
What's this?

708
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,130
I washed my husband's trousers without even checking the pockets.

709
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,180
I guess he works out these days.

710
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,200
What do you mean?

711
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,600
What's this thing from a fitness centre?

712
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,710
He doesn't work out at all.

713
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,230
He stays home all day even when I ask him to go to the spring with me.

714
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,660
The only exercise he does is breathing.

715
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,700
My classmates created a group chat.

716
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,730
Group chat?

717
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,270
Don't kids do it to bully classmates?

718
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,330
It's a serious social issue these days.

719
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,630
It's not about our classmates.

720
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,300
It's about you.

721
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Me?

722
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,720
What did I do?

723
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,200
I'll show you the chat room, but don't be shocked, okay?

724
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,600
What is it about?

725
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,130
Why would I get shocked over kids' chitchats?

726
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,460
My gosh.

727
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,390
What is wrong with him these days?

728
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,300
He has such thick skin.

729
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,320
Will he really be transferred to a different school?

730
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,690
- Nice!
 -  No, no.

731
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,090
That rumour has been going around since last year.

732
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,160
He'll probably stay here forever.

733
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,450
I want him to be gone soon.

734
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,970
Goodbye, Captain.

735
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,000
Goodbye.

736
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,130
Don't let it get to your heart.

737
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,430
It's only a small number of our class.

738
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,770
I won't, of course.

739
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,530
This is nothing. These silly kids.

740
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,930
Goodness gracious.

741
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,400
Gosh, are you okay?

742
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:15,930
Pardon?

743
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Yes.

744
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,730
I'm fine.

745
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,230
What's the matter?

746
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,530
I feel so little and insignificant.

747
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,800
Life feels so futile right now.

748
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,830
When I was younger,

749
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,030
I just thought I should do better next time.

750
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,400
But as I'm getting older, I find myself thinking,

751
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,000
"Will I be able to do better next time?"

752
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,560
I don't feel confident.

753
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,930
It sounds like you've been running at your full speed.

754
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,430
Being an adult is more difficult than we think.

755
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,410
You have to reward yourself here and there...

756
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,360
in order to keep running without tiring yourself out.

757
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,700
Reward myself?

758
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,000
Meeting someone like you who really understands me...

759
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,770
is a reward for me in and of itself.

760
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,270
Thanks for saying that.

761
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,930
There were moments in my life...

762
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,060
that I shined as brightly as them.

763
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,760
I'll see you later!

764
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,060
- Honey. Wait a second.
 -  Yes.

765
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,210
Wear this.

766
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,570
- Did you make it?
 -  Yes.

767
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,130
- Oh, my.
 -  I put a pendant on it, too.

768
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,530
"Sang Sik".

769
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,660
- Is it a little loose on you?
 -  No, it fits perfectly.

770
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,300
I love it.

771
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,930
- Ta-da.
 -  Look at that!

772
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,330
You made two?

773
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,340
They're our matching bracelets.

774
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,500
These bracelets will bring us luck.

775
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,340
Only good things await us.

776
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,300
Of course. Let me see.

777
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,500
Sang Sik and Hui Soo. They look amazing.

778
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,330
Those moments are all in the past now.

779
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,260
However,

780
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,800
my family is shining brightly in their place.

781
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,360
Hello.

782
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,330
Have we met?

783
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,360
We met during Jun Woo's class the other day.

784
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:20,730
Don't you remember?

785
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,160
You're the one who took the magazine Jun Woo is in, right?

786
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Yes.

787
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,760
I work here now.

788
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,430
I'm helping Jun Woo out.

789
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,330
I see.

790
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,460
It looks like his taste in women has changed a lot.

791
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,760
He never used to be interested in older women.

792
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,800
It sounds like you're very into him.

793
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,700
Yes. Since your job is making dramas,

794
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,230
you're quick at figuring out what's going on.

795
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,700
I hate ultra dramatic soap operas.

796
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,800
Especially for what we have going on here.

797
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,560
I'd hate to see that kind of plot unfolding.

798
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,280
What exactly do we have going on here?

799
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,330
Don't worry.

800
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,830
I won't grab you by the hair at least.

801
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,400
It sounds like you watched a lot of Korean dramas in Canada.

802
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,600
Min Joo.

803
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:15,800
Ji Sun, what are you doing here?

804
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,030
I'm Min Ji Sun.

805
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:20,530
You live next door, so I thought I should introduce myself.

806
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:22,930
See you around.

807
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,030
Are you all right? Did anything happen?

808
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,900
Nothing happened.

809
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,630
She's pretty and cute.

810
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,630
Goodness.

811
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,900
I don't get kids these days. Gosh, seriously.

812
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,900
I think that's Ye Ji.

813
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,230
What? Where?

814
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,720
That little brat...

815
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,730
She was going on about how I'm incapable of love,

816
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,910
and she's already...

817
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,000
I can't let it slide.

818
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,080
Let's just go unless you want to be called a fogey again.

819
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,250
Things will get very awkward if you pull over now.

820
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,400
But still...

821
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,630
What should I do with her?

822
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,330
I really want my dad to start dating like us.

823
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,160
Then you might get a stepmother. Will you be okay with that?

824
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,930
I'm all grown up, so it doesn't matter.

825
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,150
I have my own life,

826
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,930
and my dad needs a bit of love in his life.

827
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,120
These days, it's hard to find a family that is as tight as yours.

828
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,700
Who'd dare to try become a part of it?

829
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,030
Someone like my next-door neighbour...

830
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,410
who's single and around his age would be perfect.

831
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,830
Then you should befriend her first.

832
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,100
She's not right for him.

833
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,530
Why do you say that?

834
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,930
She doesn't keep her words and is disrespectful towards me.

835
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,600
Plus, Uncle Jun Woo announced to everyone that he's dating her.

836
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,460
You should go home now.

837
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,300
I'll walk you to your door.

838
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,300
It's okay. I'll get in trouble is any of my family sees us.

839
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,630
Why? Are you embarrassed of me?

840
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,430
So are we keeping our relationship a secret?

841
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,660
I think it's too early to tell everyone.

842
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,030
Why do you think that?

843
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,060
No specific reason. It's just how I feel.

844
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,810
That... That little rat...

845
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,930
I must teach him a lesson.

846
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,200
Actually,

847
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,810
I've been upset because I think Hae Dam likes you.

848
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,480
That's not true. You're mistaken.

849
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,270
I'm not interested in her at all.

850
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,530
I know that.

851
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,730
That's why I'm spending time with you like this.

852
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,760
That little...

853
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,450
What should I do?

854
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,730
Go in.

855
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,100
Hey, you're home.

856
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,370
Where's Sang Sik?

857
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,980
He's dealing with an emergency because of Ye Ji.

858
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,630
What? What are you talking about?

859
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,760
- Sang Sik, there you are.
 -  Yes. Give it to me.

860
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,500
I'm home.

861
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,150
Hi, Ye Ji. Were you at the library?

862
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,250
- Yes.
 -  Hey, it's really late.

863
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,450
Be careful when you come home late at night.

864
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:10,630
Will Hoon ever go to a library in his life?

865
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,600
The air is bad inside libraries.

866
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,800
You sound so pathetic right now. My goodness.

867
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,100
Sang Sik, pass me the watermelon.

868
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,030
Dad.

869
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,170
Get changed now.

870
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,480
What's going on?

871
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,910
I want to talk to you.

872
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,230
Go ahead, I hear you.

873
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,970
What have you been doing lately?

874
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,290
What do you mean?

875
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,430
I go to school, private classes and the library.

876
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,900
I'm not talking about that.

877
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,730
Are you busy dating someone?

878
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:48,550
Who told you that?

879
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,230
It's not important who told me.

880
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,090
I can't believe you're already...

881
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,130
Dad, I'm 15 years old.

882
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,740
I liked someone when I was in elementary school.

883
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,680
I also liked someone in kindergarten.

884
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,500
You didn't say much then, so why now?

885
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,660
That's because...

886
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,990
you're all grown up.

887
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:08,160
Why are you wearing something so short?

888
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,630
It's summer. What can I do when it's so hot?

889
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:16,100
You'd better not see that rascal Hyun Seok dressed like this.

890
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,930
Gosh, I can't take this any longer.

891
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,330
Where are you going again?

892
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,860
Ye Ji, Ye Ji.

893
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,260
Goodness.

894
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,000
What's going on?

895
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,360
Ye Ji...

896
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,550
and that boyfriend of hers...

897
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,260
Did she kiss him?

898
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,130
They must have, don't you think?

899
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,240
I thought you trusted her.

900
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,700
Trusting and being concerned for her are different.

901
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:47,720
People will think it's all because she was raised without a mum.

902
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,910
Come on.

903
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:51,200
You should get her a mother, then.

904
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,000
Even if you don't get married again, you should at least date someone.

905
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,860
You're all hopeless.

906
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,030
Ye Ji.

907
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,220
Do you want me to expose your private life by saying...

908
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,840
that you are dating Uncle Jun Woo on social media?

909
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,080
You should've kept your promise like an adult...

910
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,100
or you shouldn't have made a promise at all.

911
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,200
You should have been clear on your judgement and action, no?

912
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,230
Are you done?

913
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,170
Please speak if you have anything to say.

914
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,560
Let me make it clear.

915
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,080
I've never exposed your private life to anyone.

916
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,130
Even more, I've never talked about you to your father.

917
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,760
I saw it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears.

918
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,480
- What?
 -  I heard you talk about me.

919
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,910
That's why Dad said...

920
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:38,370
you shouldn't judge on your own and told you to tell him next time...

921
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:40,330
so that I can grow mature and be healthy.

922
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,130
That's the conversation you had in his study.

923
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,160
Wait.

924
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,740
I don't know why you're accusing me,

925
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,290
but the first thing is to find out where the misunderstanding started.

926
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:58,270
You told my dad that you saw me kiss Hyun Seok.

927
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,530
What are you talking about?

928
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,600
What?

929
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,730
You kissed him? It's not the other way around?

930
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:11,860
What are you talking about?

931
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,410
Ask your daughter yourself.

932
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:17,300
You didn't tell me about it when you saw that?

933
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,180
How could you fool me by teaming up with my child?

934
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,610
Who fooled who?

935
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,540
Silence could also be a lie.

936
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,060
Pretending not to know is worse.

937
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,360
Goodness. What are you talking about?

938
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,820
At her age, she can do that with her boyfriend.

939
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,560
"Boyfriend"?

940
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,200
Do you kiss your friend?

941
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,130
What?

942
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,230
What I mean is...

943
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,100
Well... I mean...

944
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,430
She's still a child.

945
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,920
She's only in middle school.

946
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,690
If you saw something like that, you should have told me.

947
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,350
What do you mean?

948
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,420
She didn't do anything wrong.

949
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,930
They kissed...

950
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,060
They smooched...

951
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,300
Well... They... Why didn't you tell me?

952
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,700
What's wrong with a kiss...

953
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,630
They can smooch if they want.

954
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:09,600
Are you saying that carelessly because she's not your child?

955
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:13,860
Children can also like someone and express their love.

956
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,410
They can hold hands if they like each other.

957
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,670
What's wrong with a kiss on the cheek?

958
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,040
She isn't young. At her age...

959
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,300
No, my child can't do that!

960
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,580
Nobody can touch my child!

961
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,840
- Dad.
 -  You can't say that when...

962
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,400
you have no child of your own.

963
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,090
Don't even say things like that.

964
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:34,130
Why are you scolding her?

965
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:35,500
Just scold me.

966
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,230
Okay, follow me.

967
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,260
Goodness.

968
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,360
Gosh.

969
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,160
By the way, you're cool.

970
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,460
You're a contemporary woman.

971
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,830
"A contemporary woman"?

972
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,500
Where are we going?

973
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,400
Just follow me.

974
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,460
Dad.

975
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,210
Did Ye Ji scold you?

976
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,610
Yes.

977
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:06,790
More than her, Chief Ko scolded me.

978
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,000
What?

979
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,130
By the way,

980
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,270
about Ji Sun...

981
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,460
Ji Sun?

982
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,760
She likes you a lot, doesn't she?

983
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,860
It's just that...

984
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,260
when I was in Canada,

985
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,360
I worked as an assistant chef at her house.

986
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,370
Her family was quite wealthy,

987
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,700
but she's the only child of divorced parents.

988
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,660
I felt bad to see her alone,

989
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
so I made a lot of Korean food for her.

990
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:37,360
Few years ago, she lost her parents in an accident and came to see me.

991
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:40,630
Have you tried soy sauce bibimbap?

992
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,310
It's his speciality.

993
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,330
No.

994
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,240
What about bulgogi japchae?

995
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,500
I haven't tried that, either.

996
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,660
Okay.

997
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,800
What is it?

998
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,130
It's nothing.

999
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,490
I wanted to tell you beforehand,

1000
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,630
but I didn't want you to misunderstand. I'm sorry.

1001
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,600
She'll go back to Canada in a month.

1002
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,060
She says she wants to slowly part with me.

1003
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,260
It's hard to understand, isn't it?

1004
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,730
No, I can understand.

1005
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,730
What? You don't feel jealous, and you're not suspicious?

1006
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,040
Must I feel that way?

1007
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,130
You're too nonchalant.

1008
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,260
I should have told you beforehand, then.

1009
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,160
Anyway, Sang Sik should make up with Ye Ji...

1010
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,900
since she's going through puberty and is sensitive.

1011
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,340
I think he's the one going through it.

1012
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,420
Why is that?

1013
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,460
"Do you kiss your friend?"

1014
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,260
What is he talking about?

1015
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,760
What is it?

1016
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,260
What?

1017
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,730
Oh, it's nothing.

1018
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,660
Like what she said, what's wrong with expressing...

1019
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,300
my feelings honestly?

1020
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,330
You're still too young for that.

1021
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:10,800
Should I be of certain age?

1022
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,330
Then when can I hold hands and kiss someone?

1023
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,600
Is it written in a textbook or the law?

1024
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,340
Why should you make the standard?

1025
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,860
It's not me. When you become an adult,

1026
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,610
you can do all those things.

1027
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:24,800
I'm not a child.

1028
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,260
I'm becoming an adult, to be exact.

1029
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,360
When I was young, you complimented me for being mature.

1030
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,700
Now, you're talking as if becoming an adult is a bad thing.

1031
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,060
That's right.

1032
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,600
Becoming an adult isn't always good.

1033
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,660
There isn't a set time to date someone you like.

1034
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:46,900
Anyone can like someone at any age.

1035
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,630
Does it happen only during a certain age?

1036
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,760
Does it happen so easily?

1037
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,230
All that matters is that I know how to control my feelings, no?

1038
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,700
Ye Ji.

1039
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,860
To be honest,

1040
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,130
I'm scared to see you...

1041
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,230
mature every day.

1042
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,600
Are you scared that I'm becoming an adult?

1043
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,560
It's not that.

1044
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,300
I don't know how to treat you...

1045
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,030
when you continue to mature day by day.

1046
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,860
I'm flustered and scared when it comes to that.

1047
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,860
I've never practised it.

1048
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,260
It's my first time.

1049
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,460
Starting from your birth...

1050
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,660
to you turning 5 or 10 years old...

1051
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,320
Even when you become 20 or 30 years old,

1052
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,000
you'll always be my first.

1053
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,500
Just when I'm about to get used to your age...

1054
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,230
Just when that happens, you start maturing again.

1055
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,360
It's always my first...

1056
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:54,500
to see what's going on with you, so it's interesting and new.

1057
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,160
But I also wonder if I'll be able to do well.

1058
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:02,100
"Can I keep up with my daughter who's changing so much?"

1059
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,260
I'm scared that I might not be able to do a good job.

1060
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,300
I have to understand you more because you don't have a mother.

1061
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,500
Or at least, I want to be the best father there is.

1062
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,860
But unlike my determination,

1063
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,860
I'm worried that I might not be able to keep up.

1064
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,700
Ye Ji.

1065
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,700
Here, your mum and I talked about something.

1066
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,700
While you were...

1067
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,130
growing up inside your mother's womb,

1068
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,660
I said that...

1069
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,230
when you're born, every day will be strange at first,

1070
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,930
but that I'll treat you well.

1071
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,130
I made a promise with your mum.

1072
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,100
Even if...

1073
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,900
I'm awkward and can't keep up with how fast you grow,

1074
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:16,730
I hope...

1075
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,060
you won't hate me or get disappointed in me.

1076
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,700
Goodness.

1077
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,160
You're all grown up.

1078
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,060
Do you kiss your friend?

1079
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,360
Oh, no.

1080
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,460
There isn't a set time to date someone you like.

1081
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,830
Anyone can like someone at any age.

1082
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,030
Does it happen only during a certain age?

1083
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,260
Does it happen so easily?

1084
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,130
Sang Sik.

1085
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,300
Do you...

1086
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,100
like me?

1087
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,900
May I come in for a minute?

1088
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,630
Sure, come in.

1089
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,200
What brings you here?

1090
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,700
Is it only me who remembers?

1091
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,900
That day, in this room...

1092
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:50,530
That... Well... That's...

1093
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,530
So you already knew.

1094
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,490
Whether I like someone or not,

1095
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,290
it's not important at all.

1096
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:10,730
Nothing will change.

1097
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,860
Why not?

1098
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,330
Even if I like someone,

1099
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,860
it won't change anything in my life.

1100
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,830
That's why...

1101
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,190
you didn't say anything...

1102
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,480
because nothing would change.

1103
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,370
It won't change.

1104
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,490
Min Joo.

1105
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,600
Didn't you say silence is also a lie?

1106
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,910
To be honest, I...

1107
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:39,000
I started...

1108
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,300
dating someone.

1109
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,200
I thought...

1110
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,330
I should tell you.

1111
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,460
Okay.

1112
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,530
That's good.

1113
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,330
Is it...

1114
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,830
really good?

1115
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:10,100
You said you wanted to give your all to the person you fell for.

1116
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,400
That's right.

1117
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,930
I'm going to.

1118
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:24,630
Then,

1119
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,330
see you.

1120
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,330
Wait a minute.

1121
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,860
This...

1122
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,860
is very similar to mine.

1123
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,130
There's no way.

1124
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,070
Mine has...

1125
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,100
"SS" engraved on it.

1126
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,300
I lost someone I loved.

1127
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,900
I was about to get married, too.

1128
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,260
Don't let go.

1129
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,300
Don't let go!

1130
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,760
(Second to Last Love)

1131
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,030
I'm your first priority from now on.

1132
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,900
Jun Woo is everything to me.

1133
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,230
Don't play games with your life.

1134
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,980
How do you know Chief Ko?

1135
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,040
You've forgotten about him, right?

1136
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,240
I'm talking about Eun Ho.

1137
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,190
Don't I look great with him?

1138
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,200
You do.

1139
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,920
You'll move aside for Jun Woo?

1140
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,270
- Have you sinned or what?
 -  I think so.

1141
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,400
If this unlucky prediction is true,

1142
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,530
it'll be difficult to endure it.
