00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:48,622
<font color="yellow">you could let go some of your past.</font>

00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,822
<font color="yellow">I thought I had forgotten about it, but...</font>

30
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:17,922
<font color="yellow">Why do you have this?</font>

31
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,782
<font color="yellow">I went to clean your study room,</font>

00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:46,522
<font color="yellow">I put it in storage.</font>

<font color="yellow">You're nuts.</font>

39
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,082
<font color="yellow">It's not a problem having you stay with me,</font>

40

46
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:11,982
<font color="yellow">and you confessed to Sang Sik.</font>

47
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:15,082
<font color="yellow">It should be easy from now. Why are you running away?</font>

<font color="yellow">it's not a matter of speed.</font>

62
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,752

<font color="yellow">exactly which direction you're going.</font>

67
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:55,952
<font color="yellow">Sir, I want to go to the wash room.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Ye Ji. - Ye Ji.</font>

72
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:09,052
<font color="yellow">Bring someone next week to teach.</font>

73
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:10,422
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

74
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:14,382
<font color="yellow">Isn't this place better than there?</font>

75
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:17,622
<font color="yellow">Yes. They have good facilities,</font>

76
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:19,782
<font color="yellow">but it hasn't been promoted enough.</font>

77
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,922
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be a good location for the characters to date.</font>

78
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:24,122
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

79
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:27,952
<font color="yellow">Then let's confirm on this and try to get more tourists there.</font>

00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:34,222

83
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:35,482
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing.</font>

84
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,752
<font color="yellow">Then where should we choose...</font>

85
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:40,222
<font color="yellow">for the shooting location?</font>

86
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,952
<font color="yellow">Did something really happen?</font>

87
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:46,052
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko!</font>

88
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:48,982
<font color="yellow">Are you going to work like this?</font>

89
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:50,322
<font color="yellow">Well?</font>

90
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:55,852
<font color="yellow">What is your relationship to Producer Kang Min Joo?</font>

91
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:57,722
<font color="yellow">Why did you make a mess there?</font>

92
00:07:58,182 --> 00:07:59,182
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

93
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:01,352
<font color="yellow">Why did you show them the boat? It's still under construction.</font>

94
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:03,252
<font color="yellow">You people broke it.</font>

95
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:06,082
<font color="yellow">The policy was that we would actively support...</font>

96
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:07,952
<font color="yellow">any applicants for the drama project.</font>

97
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:08,952
<font color="yellow">Support?</font>

98
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:11,552
<font color="yellow">We should have omitted such dangerous sites from the list.</font>

99
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,582
<font color="yellow">Even if they were picked, it should've been nullified.</font>

100
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:17,652
<font color="yellow">I gave you the boat for you to revive it.</font>

101
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:19,822
<font color="yellow">Yes. However, for something...</font>

102
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,052
<font color="yellow">you used a lot of people's taxes for,</font>

103
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,382
<font color="yellow">it was poorly constructed by your favoured contractor.</font>

104
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,152
<font color="yellow">There was a lot to be investigated.</font>

105
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:27,382
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

106
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:30,452
<font color="yellow">Are you saying this was due to poor construction?</font>

107
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:32,592
<font color="yellow">We gave the job to a proper contractor.</font>

108
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,252
<font color="yellow">You can look forward to...</font>

109
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:36,092
<font color="yellow">how we'll promote it.</font>

110
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,282
<font color="yellow">If you use extra money and fail to save it,</font>

111
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:41,722
<font color="yellow">the Woori City drama production will come to a halt.</font>

112
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:44,322
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to save your neck, either.</font>

113
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:45,822
<font color="yellow">Keep that in mind!</font>

114
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:55,482
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang. Producer Kang.</font>

115
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:56,782

117
00:08:58,682 --> 00:09:01,152
<font color="yellow">Why did you suddenly move out?</font>

118
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,452
<font color="yellow">Well, it just happened.</font>

119
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,722
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried we were?</font>

120
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,222
<font color="yellow">- Who? - Sang Sik, of course.</font>

121
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:10,682
<font color="yellow">And all of us, too.</font>

122
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:12,822
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful.</font>

123
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,122
<font color="yellow">Don't be.</font>

124
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:16,122
<font color="yellow">Where are you staying now?</font>

125
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:19,952
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

126
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,852
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations, Producer Kang. - Thank you.</font>

127
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,122
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

128
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,752
<font color="yellow">Our team was given the city project.</font>

129
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:37,052
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

130
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:40,152
<font color="yellow">You must not know about this industry.</font>

131
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:43,622
<font color="yellow">Drama production can fall through mid-way,</font>

132
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:46,482
<font color="yellow">and sometimes they don't air even when it's complete.</font>

133
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:49,352
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure. I'll do my best.</font>

134
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:51,852
<font color="yellow">I hope you watch it when it airs.</font>

135
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:53,822
<font color="yellow">Did you even listen to me?</font>

136
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,522
<font color="yellow">The girl should leave by this point.</font>

137
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,622
<font color="yellow">- Leave? - Why?</font>

138
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,622
<font color="yellow">How can they stay together feeling like that?</font>

139
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:05,422
<font color="yellow">That would mean that she didn't like him that much.</font>

140
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:08,852
<font color="yellow">I agree. They want to be together, so why should she leave?</font>

141
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:11,482
<font color="yellow">How can they stay together at this point?</font>

142
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,816
<font color="yellow">It's a little uncomfortable and awkward,</font>

143
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,322
<font color="yellow">but it's all in the past.</font>

144
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,852
<font color="yellow">What's there to be awkward about?</font>

145
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:18,782
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't it bring them closer together?</font>

146
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,982
<font color="yellow">The man doesn't dare to even look at the woman in the face.</font>

147
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:23,922
<font color="yellow">She has to leave him.</font>

148
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:26,322
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't leave if I was her.</font>

149
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,422
<font color="yellow">They should fight it together.</font>

150
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:33,722
<font color="yellow">That's real love, and that's what she should do for him.</font>

151
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:38,422
<font color="yellow">How come no one understands me?</font>

152
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:41,922
<font color="yellow">Is this how kids think these days? Am I getting too old?</font>

153
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:55,922
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo.</font>

154
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:58,122
<font color="yellow">Do you work here?</font>

155
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:00,122
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

156
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:02,482
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

157
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:04,682
<font color="yellow">I heard about Min Joo.</font>

158
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:06,182
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

159
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:07,622
<font color="yellow">It must have been tough.</font>

160
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:09,122
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine.</font>

161
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:10,782
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

162
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,552
<font color="yellow">My health is better,</font>

163
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,382
<font color="yellow">and I'm working on my feelings.</font>

164
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:17,322
<font color="yellow">That's good. I'm glad.</font>

165
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:19,822
<font color="yellow">I'm working hard in modelling,</font>

166
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:21,682
<font color="yellow">and I'm getting acting classes.</font>

167
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,952
<font color="yellow">Really? That's great news.</font>

168
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:26,082
<font color="yellow">Min Joo introduced me to it.</font>

169
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:29,822
<font color="yellow">I've never been so interested in something other than you.</font>

170
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:35,182
<font color="yellow">Good. Min Joo will be someone that's better to you than me.</font>

171
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:40,022
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo, you're still someone special to me.</font>

172
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:44,152
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

173
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:46,582
<font color="yellow">Okay, that's good.</font>

174
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:49,922
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

175
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,952
<font color="yellow">Our press conference is in two days.</font>

176
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:54,852
<font color="yellow">How can the male lead drop out right now?</font>

177
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,282
<font color="yellow">We need to persuade him. We have to shoot the poster now.</font>

178
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:00,582
<font color="yellow">- There's no point. - Pardon?</font>

179
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:03,982
<font color="yellow">He's having legal disputes with his previous agency.</font>

180
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,752
<font color="yellow">On top of that, he's a rookie.</font>

181
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,852
<font color="yellow">He's not confident about acting with Na Joo Yeon.</font>

182
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:08,982
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

183
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:10,552
<font color="yellow">What time is it?</font>

184
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:12,622
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he here yet?</font>

185
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:16,452
<font color="yellow">What should we do then? We don't have time.</font>

186
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:20,282
<font color="yellow">What about our lead from the previous drama?</font>

187
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,352
<font color="yellow">Isn't he preparing to shoot a different drama?</font>

188
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,282
<font color="yellow">The director there is a friend of mine.</font>

189
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:26,522
<font color="yellow">He was surprised at how long I've worked with that jerk.</font>

190
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:29,122
<font color="yellow">He was complaining over the phone saying he wants to fire him.</font>

191
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:30,322
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

192
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:33,952
<font color="yellow">That's true. Only you can control him.</font>

193
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,722
<font color="yellow">How can we bring him right now?</font>

194
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,852
<font color="yellow">We need something to persuade him with.</font>

195
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:40,082
<font color="yellow">There is something.</font>

196
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:44,482
<font color="yellow">Ambassador for Woori City.</font>

197
00:12:48,152 --> 00:12:49,822
<font color="yellow">Ambassador for Woori City?</font>

198
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:51,582
<font color="yellow">Since we're producing a drama,</font>

199
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:54,352
<font color="yellow">we need a new face to represent Woori City.</font>

200
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:56,482
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

201
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:58,082
<font color="yellow">What do you think about Wook Sa Ma?</font>

202
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:00,182
<font color="yellow">Wook Sa Ma? The guy from the grape festival?</font>

203
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:03,722
<font color="yellow">Yes. Thanks to him, we avoided a catastrophe.</font>

204
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:06,382
<font color="yellow">Yes. The farmers were thankful to him, as well.</font>

205
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:09,852
<font color="yellow">He'll appear in our drama...</font>

206
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,382
<font color="yellow">and become the city's ambassador, as well.</font>

207
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:13,222
<font color="yellow">Is that possible?</font>

208
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:16,552
<font color="yellow">Whose idea is this?</font>

209
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,052
<font color="yellow">Of course, it's Producer Kang's.</font>

210
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:22,022
<font color="yellow">You two look cute together.</font>

211
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,982
<font color="yellow">You should take it up a notch.</font>

212
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,022
<font color="yellow">I have a date to go to.</font>

213
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:57,122
<font color="yellow">- Ta-da. - My goodness.</font>

214
00:13:58,352 --> 00:13:59,552
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

215
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:02,052
<font color="yellow">Why are you late?</font>

216
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,452
<font color="yellow">I was here 10 minutes before we were supposed to meet.</font>

217
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:09,922
<font color="yellow">What? Then where were you all this time?</font>

218
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:11,852
<font color="yellow">I was all the way over there...</font>

219
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:13,552
<font color="yellow">watching you.</font>

220
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,352
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

221
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:19,952
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I can't believe this.</font>

222
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:23,452
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - What's wrong?</font>

223
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:26,352
<font color="yellow">You looked so lovely.</font>

224
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:29,852
<font color="yellow">Actually, the thing is,</font>

225
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:34,522
<font color="yellow">I was curious to see what you would look like while waiting for me.</font>

226
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:36,822
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I'm embarrassed.</font>

227
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:40,622
<font color="yellow">Isn't it nice here? Windy Hill.</font>

228
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,682
<font color="yellow">Just like those pin-wheels,</font>

229
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,922
<font color="yellow">we may look glamorous on the outside.</font>

230
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,822
<font color="yellow">However, we come and go...</font>

231
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,282
<font color="yellow">just like the wind.</font>

232
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,722
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time left,</font>

233
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:58,652
<font color="yellow">so don't go home tonight.</font>

234
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:00,052
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

235
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:03,052
<font color="yellow">Stay with me tonight.</font>

236
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:04,352
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

237
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,522
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

238
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:10,722
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

239
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:15,452
<font color="yellow">People are looking at us. Stop it.</font>

240
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:16,922
<font color="yellow">They must be jealous.</font>

241
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:19,322
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

242
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,252
<font color="yellow">Especially for today,</font>

243
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,482
<font color="yellow">the popular star, Wook Sa Ma, is here to give you a special lecture.</font>

244
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:32,522
<font color="yellow">Let's listen to the life he's led as an actor.</font>

245
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,222
<font color="yellow">Let's welcome him with a round of applause.</font>

246
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:49,952
<font color="yellow">Well, I have everything one could ever want.</font>

247
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,982
<font color="yellow">There's the air that I can breathe with,</font>

248
00:15:58,152 --> 00:16:00,852
<font color="yellow">and the passion I can...</font>

249
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:02,382
<font color="yellow">dream with.</font>

250
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,222
<font color="yellow">Most of all,</font>

251
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:07,052
<font color="yellow">each day grows increasingly harder to predict.</font>

252
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:10,782
<font color="yellow">Each day grows...</font>

253
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:13,822
<font color="yellow">increasingly harder to predict.</font>

254
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:18,822
<font color="yellow">Since it's hard to predict...</font>

255
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:21,722
<font color="yellow">You don't know who you'll meet and where you will go, right?</font>

256
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:24,852
<font color="yellow">Yes, bingo. Life is a gift,</font>

257
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:26,782
<font color="yellow">so don't waste it.</font>

258
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,352
<font color="yellow">You don't know what will happen in the future,</font>

259
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:31,282
<font color="yellow">so you should be faithful to your life now.</font>

260
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:33,352
<font color="yellow">Live and cherish each day.</font>

261
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:34,582
<font color="yellow">"Cherish..."</font>

262
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,352
<font color="yellow">"each moment."</font>

263
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,722
<font color="yellow">"Titanic".</font>

264
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:44,052
<font color="yellow">Correct. It's the famous quote from the movie, "Titanic".</font>

265
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:45,582
<font color="yellow">Give him a round of applause.</font>

266
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,082
<font color="yellow">Why is he here?</font>

267
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,622
<font color="yellow">It's Wook Sa Ma!</font>

268
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,552
<font color="yellow">You're always so fast.</font>

269
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,922
<font color="yellow">- Are you interested? - I'll think about it.</font>

270
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:06,222
<font color="yellow">There's no time. I need you to decide now.</font>

271
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:09,082
<font color="yellow">You have a better public image now because of the grape festival.</font>

272
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,022
<font color="yellow">You can be the city's ambassador.</font>

273
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:12,682
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll think about it.</font>

274
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:14,482
<font color="yellow">- Wook Sa Ma! - Wook Sa Ma!</font>

275
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:18,652
<font color="yellow">- Wait! - Hey!</font>

276
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,082
<font color="yellow">Why did he come here anyway?</font>

277
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:24,752
<font color="yellow">Did he leave already?</font>

278
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:37,852
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

279
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,222
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

280
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:41,082
<font color="yellow">- "Titanic"? - Yes.</font>

281
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,292
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

282
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,222
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

283
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:49,522
<font color="yellow">You should watch it on the road. It'll be fun.</font>

284
00:17:49,922 --> 00:17:51,822
<font color="yellow">Also, if you enjoyed it,</font>

285
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:53,922
<font color="yellow">please give me a call.</font>

286
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:55,252
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

287
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:00,222
<font color="yellow">Listen, Director Kim.</font>

288
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,422
<font color="yellow">I never said I'd quit.</font>

289
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,222
<font color="yellow">I only did that because you wouldn't listen to my suggestions.</font>

290
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:10,822
<font color="yellow">I'm not a robot. Why should I only do as you say?</font>

291
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:14,622
<font color="yellow">I have a mind and a heart, too.</font>

292
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:18,952
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

293
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:26,852
<font color="yellow">How annoying.</font>

294
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:39,422
<font color="yellow">The grape festival...</font>

295
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:42,322
<font color="yellow">would have been ruined if it wasn't for you.</font>

296
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:45,222
<font color="yellow">- What is this? - We sent our grapes abroad.</font>

297
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:46,752
<font color="yellow">I was so proud.</font>

298
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,552
<font color="yellow">Since you're a global star,</font>

299
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:51,452
<font color="yellow">I thought you were someone we would never meet.</font>

300
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:54,082
<font color="yellow">However, I was able to help pay...</font>

301
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:57,382
<font color="yellow">for my granddaughter's tuition thanks to you.</font>

302
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:05,322
<font color="yellow">I was too busy working to care about dramas.</font>

303
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:09,852
<font color="yellow">I cried so much as I packed the grapes to send to China.</font>

304
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,922
<font color="yellow">It was tears of happiness.</font>

305
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,922
<font color="yellow">I was so happy.</font>

306
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:28,522
<font color="yellow">Really? He agreed?</font>

307
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,482
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you!</font>

308
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:33,122
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang.</font>

309
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:36,522
<font color="yellow">Wook Sa Ma agreed to appear in the drama.</font>

310
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:39,252
<font color="yellow">He'll be in our drama.</font>

313

<font color="yellow">What? Really?</font>

314
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:50,922
<font color="yellow">He says he trusts your your talent and ability.</font>

315
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:54,382
<font color="yellow">He called the city and said that he's confident in making it a hit.</font>

316
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:56,752

<font color="yellow">Hyun Seok,</font>

336
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:57,952
<font color="yellow">you guys should try and get along. I don't know what happened,</font>

<font color="yellow">She's more than just a friend to me.</font>

339
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:06,082
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

340
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,222
<font color="yellow">Did you make up with Hyun Seok?</font>

341
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:11,682
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

342
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:13,182
<font color="yellow">What is it then?</font>

343
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,982
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I can't seem to forgive him.</font>

344
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:19,082
<font color="yellow">All I need is a sincere apology.</font>

345
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:23,182
<font color="yellow">I thought you said you'd never see a boy again.</font>

<font color="yellow">No way. I'm only going to study there.</font>

348
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:32,752
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

349
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,222
<font color="yellow">- Hey, hey. - Wow.</font>

350
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:36,522
<font color="yellow">You guys look good together.</font>

351
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:38,522
<font color="yellow">Did you two go on a date?</font>

352
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:40,182
<font color="yellow">No, we didn't. Give it to me.</font>

353
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:41,752
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

354
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:44,082
<font color="yellow">Are you guys dating?</font>

355
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:45,352
<font color="yellow">I said, no.</font>

356
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,382
<font color="yellow">They why did she suddenly move out?</font>

357
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:49,052
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

358
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:50,582
<font color="yellow">Did you fight?</font>

359
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:52,752
<font color="yellow">You had a fight.</font>

360
00:21:53,222 --> 00:21:55,152
<font color="yellow">You are dating her, after all.</font>

361
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:56,852
<font color="yellow">You're so sneaky.</font>

362
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,782
<font color="yellow">What? Sneaky?</font>

363
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:02,782
<font color="yellow">What's the problem? It didn't work out with Jun Woo anyway.</font>

364
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:05,982
<font color="yellow">You should just make up with her. Why did you make her move?</font>

365
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:07,752
<font color="yellow">That's not gentleman-like at all.</font>

366
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:10,382
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

367
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:13,452
<font color="yellow">I guess love is more difficult for adults...</font>

368
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:15,722
<font color="yellow">since it even made her move out.</font>

369
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:25,822
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat. - It looks delicious.</font>

370
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:28,052
<font color="yellow">I guess Sang Sik is skipping breakfast again.</font>

371
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:30,852
<font color="yellow">I know why he's fasting.</font>

372
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,052
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

373
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:33,552
<font color="yellow">It's because of the woman next door.</font>

374
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,482
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

375
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:39,152
<font color="yellow">Are you okay with it, Jun Woo?</font>

376
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:43,782
<font color="yellow">What is it? Does it make you uncomfortable that I know?</font>

377
00:22:43,982 --> 00:22:46,952
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to be uncomfortable about. You're just smart.</font>

378
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:48,622
<font color="yellow">I don't mind at all.</font>

379
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:50,852
<font color="yellow">They're adults. They should take care of it.</font>

380
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:52,382
<font color="yellow">Take care of what?</font>

381
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:55,822
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, are you skipping breakfast again?</font>

382
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,682
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm not feeling very good. Go ahead.</font>

383
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:00,922
<font color="yellow">You should just apologise.</font>

384
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:07,252
<font color="yellow">If you like her, just apologise and bring her back.</font>

385
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,752
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

386
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:16,682
<font color="yellow">Nothing. You and Hyun Seok, men are all the same.</font>

387
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:42,122
<font color="yellow">As I became an adult, I told myself "Not yet".</font>

388
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,022
<font color="yellow">"It's not time yet".</font>

389
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:45,922
<font color="yellow">I ended up being more careful.</font>

390
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:48,622
<font color="yellow">However, as we live in the moment,</font>

391
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:50,922
<font color="yellow">saying "Not yet"...</font>

392
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:55,082
<font color="yellow">might be a placeholder in place of our fear and cowardice.</font>

393
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:02,652
<font color="yellow">As I became an adult, I kept on telling myself...</font>

394
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:05,622
<font color="yellow">"I should have done that" and "I shouldn't have done that".</font>

395
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:09,352
<font color="yellow">I continuously look back at the decisions I've made.</font>

396
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:13,022
<font color="yellow">Although the decisions may look like they are wrong now,</font>

397
00:24:13,322 --> 00:24:16,782
<font color="yellow">I must remember that they were the best decisions at the time.</font>

398
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:27,482
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

399
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:30,522
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm nearby.</font>

400
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:35,922
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing here?</font>

401
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:38,622
<font color="yellow">Well, you know...</font>

402
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:41,522
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. - Thank you.</font>

403
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:48,152
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened between you and Sang Sik,</font>

404
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:50,582
<font color="yellow">but how can you just take off like that?</font>

405
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:55,222
<font color="yellow">There's still a lot of time before the lease is over.</font>

406
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:57,122
<font color="yellow">If you feel uncomfortable,</font>

407
00:24:57,222 --> 00:24:59,822
<font color="yellow">just spend a few days out and then come right back.</font>

408
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:02,022
<font color="yellow">It's not a simple matter.</font>

409
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:03,652
<font color="yellow">Please just sort it out for me.</font>

410
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:08,122
<font color="yellow">Actually, I have a problem.</font>

411
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:09,322
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

412
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:10,952
<font color="yellow">What problem?</font>

413
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,522
<font color="yellow">It's because of Hoon.</font>

414
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:14,252
<font color="yellow">We're preparing for his study in China.</font>

415
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:17,322
<font color="yellow">I had to hand in an income lease contract, so I did.</font>

416
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,052
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

417
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,782
<font color="yellow">What did Sang Sik do?</font>

418
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:23,582
<font color="yellow">What did he do wrong?</font>

419
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:26,952
<font color="yellow">I'll be... I mean, all of us will be good to you. Please?</font>

420
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:34,322
<font color="yellow">They say you eat with your eyes.</font>

421
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:37,152
<font color="yellow">That means plating is that important.</font>

422
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:39,482
<font color="yellow">These North European colours and simplicity...</font>

423
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:41,652
<font color="yellow">help make the food taste even better.</font>

424
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:46,722
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

425
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:49,322
<font color="yellow">I have to take that.</font>

426
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:57,852
<font color="yellow">Did you finish posting the photos?</font>

427
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:00,282
<font color="yellow">Yes, take a look. Do you like it?</font>

428
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:04,522
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. You're good enough to be a professional photographer.</font>

429
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:08,022
<font color="yellow">I have a good eye, you know.</font>

430
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:10,182
<font color="yellow">You're one talented woman, Writer Ko.</font>

431
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:15,652
<font color="yellow">Hey, but why does this one only have my face in it?</font>

432
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:18,052
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

433
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:23,022
<font color="yellow">Well, I just happened to take those photos.</font>

434
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:33,782
<font color="yellow">Did my handsome face make you keep pressing the shutter?</font>

435
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:43,722
<font color="yellow">I should teach Sang Sik how to use social media.</font>

436
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:46,752
<font color="yellow">Do you actually think he'll do this?</font>

437
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:49,352
<font color="yellow">Even posting photos on the city hall's website annoys him.</font>

438
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:51,582
<font color="yellow">He may find it confusing, but he should keep practising.</font>

439
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:53,822
<font color="yellow">That way, he'll be able to know how she's doing...</font>

440
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:55,952
<font color="yellow">even if they're not together.</font>

441
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,482
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

442
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,852
<font color="yellow">That's a good idea.</font>

443
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,352
<font color="yellow">Then I...</font>

444
00:27:05,152 --> 00:27:06,152
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

445
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:07,582
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

446
00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:16,452
<font color="yellow">- Producer Kang. - Yes?</font>

447
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,652
<font color="yellow">Are you on any social media platforms?</font>

448
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:21,582
<font color="yellow">No. I used to use it, but I don't any more.</font>

449
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:23,122
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

450
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:26,682
<font color="yellow">It feels like a hassle,</font>

451
00:27:26,782 --> 00:27:30,482
<font color="yellow">and I don't feel too comfortable about sharing my life so openly.</font>

452
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,022
<font color="yellow">My site has been taken over by those pop-up advertisements.</font>

453
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:34,522
<font color="yellow">When she was super popular as a director,</font>

454
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,852
<font color="yellow">she used to get as many comments as celebrities usually get.</font>

455
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:41,522
<font color="yellow">We could post updates about the Woori City drama to promote it.</font>

456
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:42,682
<font color="yellow">I think it's a good idea.</font>

457
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:45,722
<font color="yellow">No one really visits my blog.</font>

458
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:48,752
<font color="yellow">Shall I reactivate your account for you?</font>

459
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:51,382
<font color="yellow">I think it's a great idea.</font>

460
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,452
<font color="yellow">- To promote the drama? - Yes.</font>

461
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:56,082
<font color="yellow">Shall we do that?</font>

462
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:57,782
<font color="yellow">Social media?</font>

463
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,122
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

464
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,952
<font color="yellow">I mean, the Woori City song made you a star.</font>

465
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:03,852
<font color="yellow">It'll be great for promoting Woori City.</font>

466
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:07,052
<font color="yellow">Maintaining those things is a lot of work.</font>

467
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,282
<font color="yellow">You can post about touristic attractions...</font>

468
00:28:09,552 --> 00:28:11,752
<font color="yellow">as well as safety issues for the citizens.</font>

469
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,852
<font color="yellow">It'll also be a great way to inform people...</font>

470
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:16,652
<font color="yellow">about fire hazards, heat waves and earthquakes.</font>

471
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,852
<font color="yellow">- That's actually a good idea. - I know, right?</font>

472
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:20,622
<font color="yellow">Just open an account first.</font>

473
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:22,822
<font color="yellow">You have to keep doing it to get used to it.</font>

474
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:24,852
<font color="yellow">I'll open an account for you.</font>

475
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:26,452
<font color="yellow">Sure. Do it.</font>

476
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:29,922
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

477
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:32,152
<font color="yellow">So she can't terminate the lease for you?</font>

478
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:34,722
<font color="yellow">She said she won't be able to do it for a little while.</font>

479
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:38,322
<font color="yellow">Just meet up with him and try to talk it through.</font>

480
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:40,982
<font color="yellow">I already tried talking to him and everything else I could think of.</font>

481
00:28:41,282 --> 00:28:43,922
<font color="yellow">People often say that they're breaking up...</font>

482
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,482
<font color="yellow">for the other party in the relationship,</font>

483
00:28:45,852 --> 00:28:47,282
<font color="yellow">but I just don't buy that.</font>

484
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:50,622
<font color="yellow">You're saying that you broke up with him for his sake,</font>

485
00:28:50,822 --> 00:28:54,752
<font color="yellow">but you could've left because he didn't stop you.</font>

486
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:56,452
<font color="yellow">Think hard about it.</font>

487
00:28:59,452 --> 00:29:00,982
<font color="yellow">- Just a second. - Okay.</font>

488
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:03,352
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

489
00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:05,752
<font color="yellow">I'm with a friend now.</font>

490
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,482
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Was that today?</font>

491
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:12,322
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I completely forgot about it.</font>

492
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:14,222
<font color="yellow">Yes, all right.</font>

493
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:16,552
<font color="yellow">What was it about?</font>

494
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:18,582
<font color="yellow">It was my student whom I told you about the other day.</font>

495
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:22,182
<font color="yellow">I said I'd go to the city's education fair with him today.</font>

496
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:23,782
<font color="yellow">Today is the last day.</font>

497
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:25,652
<font color="yellow">I'm fine, so just get going.</font>

498
00:29:26,052 --> 00:29:28,052
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll see you at home, then.</font>

499
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:29,382
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

500
00:29:29,782 --> 00:29:32,122
<font color="yellow">- Feel free to go in without me. - Okay.</font>

501
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:34,622
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - No problem.</font>

502
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:50,652
<font color="yellow">What did you think of it?</font>

503
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,322
<font color="yellow">I found it very informative and helpful.</font>

504
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,452
<font color="yellow">- Thanks. - Hey, where are you going?</font>

505
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:57,082
<font color="yellow">- My gosh! - Let's go grab another drink.</font>

506
00:29:57,082 --> 00:29:58,782
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

507
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:01,452
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - Yes.</font>

508
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:03,122
<font color="yellow">Who is this kid?</font>

509
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:05,122
<font color="yellow">Just continue along.</font>

510
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:07,582
<font color="yellow">You two look so lovely together.</font>

511
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:09,782
<font color="yellow">What's the age difference between you two?</font>

512
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:12,782
<font color="yellow">She looks at least 10 years older than him.</font>

513
00:30:12,982 --> 00:30:14,652
<font color="yellow">Isn't he her son?</font>

514
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:15,822
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

515
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:17,522
<font color="yellow">Let's just go.</font>

516
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:18,852
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going?</font>

517
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:21,722
<font color="yellow">You just littered the street.</font>

518
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:25,052
<font color="yellow">Go home. You two are drunk.</font>

519
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:27,622
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. Don't hang out with kids like him.</font>

520
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:28,852
<font color="yellow">Guys like us are available, too.</font>

521
00:30:28,982 --> 00:30:30,252
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Sir, please...</font>

522
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:31,422
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing right now?</font>

523
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:34,082
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Look at this kid.</font>

524
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:36,622
<font color="yellow">- I shall teach him a lesson. - Hey, let's just go.</font>

525
00:30:36,722 --> 00:30:38,152
<font color="yellow">- Come on. - Hey, let go.</font>

526
00:30:38,522 --> 00:30:40,222
<font color="yellow">- I'll let it slide this once. - Let's go.</font>

527
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:44,782
<font color="yellow">Those jerks, seriously.</font>

528
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:47,382
<font color="yellow">They must be around my age. I'm embarrassed for them.</font>

529
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:51,922
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - Of course.</font>

530
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:55,822
<font color="yellow">You didn't get injured, right?</font>

531
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:57,622
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm fine.</font>

532
00:30:58,622 --> 00:30:59,622
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

533
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,322
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

00:31:16,122 --> 00:31:18,022
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't believe he's on here.</font>

537
00:31:19,982 --> 00:31:21,982
<font color="yellow">All of these photos were posted recently.</font>

538
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:30,452
<font color="yellow">You should at least thank Mr Ko, don't you think?</font>

539
00:31:38,952 --> 00:31:41,622
<font color="yellow">I just want to thank you for what you did for Wook Sa Ma.</font>

540
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:45,052
<font color="yellow">I thought I should thank you as the chief producer of SBC.</font>

541
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:47,822
<font color="yellow">I'll wait for you in front of Cheonglim Station...</font>

<font color="yellow">after work this Wednesday.</font>

543
00:31:52,322 --> 00:31:53,922
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm so sorry!</font>

544
00:31:54,052 --> 00:31:55,382
<font color="yellow">I said I'm fine.</font>

545
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:56,782
<font color="yellow">You should've stayed out for longer.</font>

546
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,452
<font color="yellow">Why would I do that?</font>

547
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:00,252
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hang out with him all night.</font>

548
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,622
<font color="yellow">If you like him, you can.</font>

549
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:03,982
<font color="yellow">I said he's just my student.</font>

550
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:06,282
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. You said you don't like younger guys.</font>

551
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:07,652
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

552
00:32:08,352 --> 00:32:10,282
<font color="yellow">he actually looked so manly today.</font>

553
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:13,252
<font color="yellow">- What? - When we were walking,</font>

554
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:15,452
<font color="yellow">drunk guys came up to us and started hitting on me.</font>

555
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:19,622
<font color="yellow">"Leave her alone, will you?"</font>

556
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:21,982
<font color="yellow">"What do you think you're doing right now?"</font>

557
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:24,482
<font color="yellow">Good for you!</font>

558
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:27,382
<font color="yellow">That must be why people date.</font>

559
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,052
<font color="yellow">Have you heard from him?</font>

560
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:34,452
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

561
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:36,222
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting to hear from him?</font>

562
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,452
<font color="yellow">I wanted to thank him for helping me with work,</font>

563
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:41,752
<font color="yellow">so I sent him a message saying we should meet up,</font>

564
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:43,922
<font color="yellow">but I don't know what will come out of it.</font>

565
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:46,952
<font color="yellow">Breaking up is also part of dating,</font>

566
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,422
<font color="yellow">so it's not over yet.</font>

567
00:32:57,582 --> 00:33:00,422
<font color="yellow">So you're here with your friends to watch the live show with singers?</font>

568
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:02,852
<font color="yellow">Yes. A little while ago,</font>

569
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,922
<font color="yellow">I looked up all the dramas you made and watched them all.</font>

570
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:09,022
<font color="yellow">- You did? - Watching your dramas...</font>

571
00:33:09,222 --> 00:33:11,082
<font color="yellow">makes me get chocked up right here with emotions.</font>

572
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:13,682
<font color="yellow">Unlike those dramas you forget about after watching them,</font>

573
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:15,482
<font color="yellow">they all left me with lingering emotions.</font>

574
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:19,552
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm even more fond of you now,</font>

575
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:21,282
<font color="yellow">even though I already liked you before.</font>

576
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,282
<font color="yellow">You're so cool.</font>

577
00:33:23,622 --> 00:33:25,922
<font color="yellow">So what is it that you want to talk to me about?</font>

578
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:29,322
<font color="yellow">I think you should keep seeing my dad.</font>

579
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:32,822
<font color="yellow">- What? - I have seen you two...</font>

580
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:34,522
<font color="yellow">arguing and bickering at each other often,</font>

581
00:33:34,822 --> 00:33:37,252
<font color="yellow">but it wouldn't be bad to stay friends for now.</font>

582
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:40,282
<font color="yellow">- For now? - Best friends never break up,</font>

583
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:42,852
<font color="yellow">whereas couples and married couples can break up.</font>

584
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,022
<font color="yellow">You're so mature.</font>

585
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:48,452
<font color="yellow">Well, I've experienced a breakup when Hyun Seok and I broke it off.</font>

586
00:33:50,482 --> 00:33:52,622
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hungry? Eat with me before you go.</font>

<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. You must be busy.</font>

588
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:57,952
<font color="yellow">My friends are waiting for me, so I should get going.</font>

589
00:33:58,152 --> 00:33:59,182
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

590
00:33:59,982 --> 00:34:01,152
<font color="yellow">All right, then. Get going.</font>

00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:16,352
<font color="yellow">- jjambbong is the best. - Jjambbong is the best.</font>

767
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:20,152
<font color="yellow">- You should go. - Ms Koo.</font>

768
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:21,952
<font color="yellow">Well... Gosh.</font>

769
00:44:23,752 --> 00:44:26,052
<font color="yellow">Do you know that you were my first love?</font>

770
00:44:27,622 --> 00:44:28,622
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

771
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:31,352
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying. Go in.</font>

772
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:32,722
<font color="yellow">Take this umbrella.</font>

773
00:44:33,752 --> 00:44:34,752
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

774
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:37,422
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Okay, bye.</font>

775
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:50,182
<font color="yellow">Min Joo!</font>

776
00:44:59,752 --> 00:45:02,122
<font color="yellow">- Thanks. - I meant to give you the key,</font>

777
00:45:02,122 --> 00:45:03,222
<font color="yellow">but I forgot.</font>

778
00:45:04,222 --> 00:45:06,552
<font color="yellow">You should've just bought an umbrella.</font>

779
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:08,282
<font color="yellow">I wasn't in the mood to do that.</font>

780
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:09,952
<font color="yellow">Why? Did something happen?</font>

781
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,982
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd see him today, but I was wrong.</font>

782
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:17,982
<font color="yellow">I saw him walking with a woman, sharing an umbrella together.</font>

783
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:19,422
<font color="yellow">Seriously? Mr Ko did that?</font>

784
00:45:19,582 --> 00:45:20,582
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

785
00:45:20,982 --> 00:45:22,552
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were mistaken.</font>

786
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:25,282
<font color="yellow">No. I saw it clearly with my own eyes.</font>

787
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:27,022
<font color="yellow">She must be just someone he knows.</font>

788
00:45:28,952 --> 00:45:32,852
<font color="yellow">He was being so nice to her. He seemed to be having a great time,</font>

789
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:35,622
<font color="yellow">and it looked like they were clicking.</font>

790
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:37,122
<font color="yellow">You're...</font>

791
00:45:37,922 --> 00:45:38,982
<font color="yellow">jealous, aren't you?</font>

792
00:45:38,982 --> 00:45:40,782
<font color="yellow">That is complete nonsense.</font>

793
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:42,382
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

794
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:44,082
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

795
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:45,752
<font color="yellow">didn't think...</font>

796
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:49,122
<font color="yellow">that he'd be completely fine after what we went through.</font>

797
00:45:49,722 --> 00:45:52,482
<font color="yellow">Did you expect him to walk around looking as if someone died?</font>

798
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:53,822
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm saying.</font>

799
00:45:54,622 --> 00:45:55,852
<font color="yellow">But this is wrong.</font>

800
00:45:56,082 --> 00:45:57,582
<font color="yellow">Just call him.</font>

801
00:45:58,052 --> 00:45:59,122
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

802
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:00,752
<font color="yellow">You're waiting for his call.</font>

803
00:46:01,052 --> 00:46:02,582
<font color="yellow">- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.</font>

804
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,322
<font color="yellow">I said I'm not!</font>

805
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,722
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji.</font>

806
00:46:10,952 --> 00:46:12,052
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dad.</font>

807
00:46:12,752 --> 00:46:13,852
<font color="yellow">By any chance,</font>

808
00:46:14,482 --> 00:46:16,382
<font color="yellow">did you invite someone...</font>

809
00:46:16,852 --> 00:46:18,082
<font color="yellow">to the talent donation event?</font>

810
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:19,252
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

811
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:22,352
<font color="yellow">I didn't have anything prepared until the day of,</font>

812
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:25,922
<font color="yellow">so I called Ms Kang just in case, and she came right away.</font>

813
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:28,052
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

814
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,322
<font color="yellow">I promised her that I wouldn't tell you.</font>

815
00:46:30,852 --> 00:46:32,522
<font color="yellow">- What? - She said...</font>

816
00:46:32,522 --> 00:46:34,382
<font color="yellow">that she did it for me as a friend...</font>

817
00:46:34,382 --> 00:46:35,952
<font color="yellow">and that there's no need for you to know.</font>

818
00:46:37,082 --> 00:46:38,152
<font color="yellow">Is that what she said?</font>

819
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:40,282
<font color="yellow">You should call her and thank her for me.</font>

820
00:46:40,552 --> 00:46:41,852
<font color="yellow">Sure. I will.</font>

821
00:47:04,182 --> 00:47:07,352

<font color="yellow">(Ko Sang Sik)</font>

823
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:42,082
<font color="yellow">The number cannot be reached. Please leave a message after...</font>

824
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,682
<font color="yellow">I didn't look at anything else. He said that he was a lawyer,</font>

825
00:47:53,682 --> 00:47:55,852
<font color="yellow">so I married him thinking that my life will be taken care of.</font>

826
00:47:56,822 --> 00:48:00,022
<font color="yellow">I had no idea that he'd cheat on me and leave me that quickly.</font>

827
00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:03,582
<font color="yellow">Hearing your life story is making me realise...</font>

828
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:05,582
<font color="yellow">that you've lived one tough life.</font>

829

<font color="yellow">Everyone at our age...</font>

830
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:10,482
<font color="yellow">has gone through at least one crisis, you know?</font>

831
00:48:10,782 --> 00:48:13,682
<font color="yellow">I wanted to become a teacher whom students look up to,</font>

832
00:48:15,052 --> 00:48:16,522
<font color="yellow">but I've decided to just let it all go...</font>

833
00:48:16,782 --> 00:48:18,122
<font color="yellow">and do whatever I want from now on.</font>

834
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:20,182
<font color="yellow">Teacher?</font>

835
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:23,552
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Oh, what I meant was...</font>

836
00:48:23,822 --> 00:48:26,122
<font color="yellow">I used to dream of becoming a teacher when I was young.</font>

837
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:28,482
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. - No.</font>

838
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:30,282
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't drink any more.</font>

839
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:31,682
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

840
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,322
<font color="yellow">Let's talk a little more.</font>

841
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:34,722
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

842
00:48:35,052 --> 00:48:36,322
<font color="yellow">Let's go to bed.</font>

843
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:41,582
<font color="yellow">You... You want to go to bed?</font>

844
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:44,622
<font color="yellow">Are we not going to sleep? I have to take a shower, too.</font>

845
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:47,052
<font color="yellow">Right. If that's the case...</font>

846
00:48:48,182 --> 00:48:49,352
<font color="yellow">You should wash up first.</font>

847
00:48:50,122 --> 00:48:51,122
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

848
00:49:55,652 --> 00:49:56,922
<font color="yellow">Are you stepping out?</font>

849
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,822
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to find a good spot for this.</font>

850
00:50:02,952 --> 00:50:04,722
<font color="yellow">You should wash up, too.</font>

851
00:50:05,482 --> 00:50:06,522
<font color="yellow">Yes, I should.</font>

852
00:50:19,482 --> 00:50:23,352
<font color="yellow">This jerk. His phone is off, and he didn't even come home.</font>

853
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:27,282
<font color="yellow">Mum. Did Dad not come home last night?</font>

854
00:50:28,182 --> 00:50:30,782
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know. Just go to school.</font>

855
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:37,182
<font color="yellow">I know which gym he goes to. Shall I tell you where it is?</font>

856
00:50:37,722 --> 00:50:38,822
<font color="yellow">Do you really know?</font>

857
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:40,852
<font color="yellow">Ae Kyung Sports Centre.</font>

858
00:50:41,652 --> 00:50:42,782
<font color="yellow">No, he doesn't work out there.</font>

859
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:45,222
<font color="yellow">No? I saw a towel from that place.</font>

860
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:48,352
<font color="yellow">- A towel? - It was with his workout clothes.</font>

861
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,452
<font color="yellow">I put it in the laundry basket.</font>

862
00:50:53,452 --> 00:50:54,782
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later!</font>

863
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:58,422
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay. Have a good day.</font>

864
00:51:08,782 --> 00:51:09,782
<font color="yellow">My gosh!</font>

865
00:51:10,282 --> 00:51:11,282
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

866
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:12,852
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

867
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:15,022
<font color="yellow">You're Min Joo's friend, right?</font>

868
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:16,322
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

869
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:18,822
<font color="yellow">Have you seen my husband here by any chance?</font>

870
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:20,922
<font color="yellow">Your husband? What's his name?</font>

871
00:51:21,122 --> 00:51:22,852
<font color="yellow">His name is Park Cheon Soo.</font>

872
00:51:23,552 --> 00:51:25,822
<font color="yellow">There's no one with that name here.</font>

873
00:51:26,552 --> 00:51:27,552
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

874
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:30,122
<font color="yellow">There's no one with that name?</font>

875
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:33,652
<font color="yellow">What is your name?</font>

876
00:51:33,852 --> 00:51:35,582
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking my name?</font>

877
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:38,622
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Ae Kyung? Get in the car.</font>

878
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:43,222
<font color="yellow">I clearly heard him saying Ae Kyung.</font>

879
00:51:44,322 --> 00:51:45,322
<font color="yellow">Ae Kyung.</font>

880
00:51:45,652 --> 00:51:46,652
<font color="yellow">Ae Kyung.</font>

881
00:51:47,752 --> 00:51:48,952
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Ae Kyung?</font>

882
00:51:50,222 --> 00:51:51,852
<font color="yellow">Then Wingless Angel is...</font>

883
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:54,852
<font color="yellow">Min Joo's friend?</font>

884
00:52:13,682 --> 00:52:15,182
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping, Richard?</font>

885
00:52:16,252 --> 00:52:18,122
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

886
00:52:21,122 --> 00:52:22,852
<font color="yellow">You should just sleep if you're tired.</font>

887
00:52:22,982 --> 00:52:24,322
<font color="yellow">No, let's...</font>

888
00:52:25,182 --> 00:52:27,082
<font color="yellow">We should do it.</font>

889
00:52:29,982 --> 00:52:31,452
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

890
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,382
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

891
00:52:35,682 --> 00:52:36,982
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

892
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,552
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

893
00:53:17,952 --> 00:53:19,252
<font color="yellow">(House ghost)</font>

894
00:53:19,852 --> 00:53:22,722
<font color="yellow">It's "Wingless Angel".</font>

895
00:53:29,782 --> 00:53:30,782
<font color="yellow">Ae Kyung.</font>

896
00:53:33,182 --> 00:53:34,782
<font color="yellow">Just go.</font>

897
00:53:35,152 --> 00:53:36,152
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

898
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:39,822
<font color="yellow">I'm tired, so I'm just going to sleep.</font>

899
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:44,582
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll get going, then.</font>

900
00:53:47,452 --> 00:53:49,822
<font color="yellow">Good night. Have a good sleep.</font>

901
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:04,382
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you fool!</font>

902
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:08,152
<font color="yellow">You're a complete fool who can't even do anything!</font>

903
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:11,522
<font color="yellow">Go in, or you'll be late for class.</font>

904
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,552
<font color="yellow">It sounds like he's so inexperienced.</font>

905
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,122
<font color="yellow">I like how naive he is.</font>

906
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:18,752
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

907
00:54:19,052 --> 00:54:21,152
<font color="yellow">I don't need that at this age. It's not exactly first love.</font>

908
00:54:21,622 --> 00:54:23,022
<font color="yellow">Apparently, I'm someone's first love.</font>

909
00:54:23,482 --> 00:54:25,652
<font color="yellow">- Who said that? - Oh, you know.</font>

910
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:28,022
<font color="yellow">My old student I met when I went on that blind date.</font>

911
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:30,722
<font color="yellow">Did he tell you that you were his first love?</font>

912
00:54:31,622 --> 00:54:33,122
<font color="yellow">All kids do that, you know?</font>

913
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:34,522
<font color="yellow">They all have a crush on their teachers.</font>

914
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:36,922
<font color="yellow">I see that both of you are dating now.</font>

915
00:54:37,122 --> 00:54:38,982
<font color="yellow">- Dating? - Gosh, no.</font>

916
00:54:39,082 --> 00:54:42,452
<font color="yellow">Don't deny it. I can tell that you two are over the moon now.</font>

917
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:43,752
<font color="yellow">- We are? - We are?</font>

918
00:54:43,852 --> 00:54:45,052
<font color="yellow">You copycat.</font>

919
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:53,622
