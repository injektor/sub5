00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,620
<font color="yellow">It's okay now.</font>

155
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,140
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

156
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,080
<font color="yellow">I told you how I feel about you.</font>

157
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

158
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,380
<font color="yellow">you can feel free to do this when you console me.</font>

159
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,120
<font color="yellow">We can't do this. We mustn't. Okay?</font>

160
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,620
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

161
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,930
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.</font>

162
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,150
<font color="yellow">I'm your next-door...</font>

163
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,780
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,650

<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

167
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,350
<font color="yellow">If it's about the house, we can talk later. I have to go.</font>

171
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,220
<font color="yellow">- What I want to say is...
-  Is it because of a woman?</font>

172
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,820
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  You're saying no to me.</font>

173
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,820

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,700
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I'm not seeing anyone.</font>

175
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,670
<font color="yellow">Then what about the blind date?</font>

176
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,550
<font color="yellow">I'm not going on any blind date. Have you lost your mind?</font>

177
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,190
<font color="yellow">Then we're good.</font>

178
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,190
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

179

181
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,230
<font color="yellow">What is it that I can't do, exactly?</font>

182
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,420
<font color="yellow">Did I ask you to do something with me?</font>

183
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,650
<font color="yellow">I'm neither asking you to marry me now...</font>

<font color="yellow">nor saying that we should live together.</font>

185
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,550
<font color="yellow">I just told you my honest feelings.</font>

186
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,820
<font color="yellow">Let's start by getting to know each other better.</font>

187
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,420
<font color="yellow">Getting to know each other?</font>

188
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,720
<font color="yellow">The reason why I'd like to speak to you isn't about the house.</font>

192
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,850

-  I heard you're busy these days.</font>

218
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,680
<font color="yellow">I couldn't tell you because nothing has been published under my name.</font>

219
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,080
<font color="yellow">Is that why you copied the popular drama?</font>

<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

221
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,050
<font color="yellow">Who said that?</font>

225
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,080

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,880
<font color="yellow">You were the only person I could think of at the moment.</font>

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,180

272
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,850
<font color="yellow">you hide in the back and try to come up with ruses...</font>

273
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,300
<font color="yellow">and ideas to negotiate like a con artist.</font>

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,580
<font color="yellow">If you made a mistake, take responsibility for it.</font>

278
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,380
<font color="yellow">And do not involve my family in anything you do from now on.</font>

279
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,020
<font color="yellow">What do you mean...</font>

280
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,380
<font color="yellow">My family is doing fine now, so do not bother us.</font>

281
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,380
<font color="yellow">I don't think you live in the area.</font>

282
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,180
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you before.</font>

283
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,180
<font color="yellow">I moved here a few days ago.</font>

284
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking alone when you're that beautiful?</font>

285
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,450
<font color="yellow">I know. Life is ridiculous.</font>

286
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,780
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you know Mr Ko Sang Sik...</font>

287
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,850
<font color="yellow">who works at the city hall?</font>

288
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,180
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know him very well. Why do you ask?</font>

289
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,380
<font color="yellow">What is he like?</font>

290
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,330
<font color="yellow">How shall I describe him?</font>

291
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,850
<font color="yellow">I guess he's extremely by the book.</font>

292
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,280
<font color="yellow">He never compromises.</font>

293
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,490
<font color="yellow">No exceptions.</font>

294
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,230
<font color="yellow">He's cut out to be a government employee.</font>

295
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,840
<font color="yellow">He must have at least one flaw.</font>

296
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,760
<font color="yellow">He has many flaws.</font>

297
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,280
<font color="yellow">He's starting to lose hair, and he's single.</font>

298
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,580
<font color="yellow">Oh, his weakness is his family.</font>

299
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,330
<font color="yellow">His family is definitely his priority.</font>

300
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,820
<font color="yellow">He takes great care of them.</font>

301
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,280
<font color="yellow">But all of his family members are very quirky.</font>

302
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,780
<font color="yellow">They're all a bit of troublemakers,</font>

303
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,420
<font color="yellow">but he goes all crazy when anything happens to his family.</font>

304
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,630
<font color="yellow">So be careful not to get involved in anything with his family.</font>

305
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,550
<font color="yellow">If you do, you'll lose it.</font>

306
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,360
<font color="yellow">So the drama filming crew you've been following around was...</font>

307
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,620
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

308
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,510
<font color="yellow">She's the chief producer of that drama.</font>

309
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,470
<font color="yellow">She's a total troublemaker. Look what happened to Mi Rae.</font>

310
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,980
<font color="yellow">You should stay away from her.</font>

311
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,550
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Sang Sik. You're being overly sensitive.</font>

312
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,450
<font color="yellow">I think she's pretty cool.</font>

313
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,220
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

314
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,040
<font color="yellow">Why did you move out of that house anyway?</font>

315
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,820
<font color="yellow">I like living with all of you here...</font>

316
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,860
<font color="yellow">a lot more than living there all alone.</font>

317
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,890
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

318
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,730
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik. Please let go of the past.</font>

319
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,250
<font color="yellow">And stop worrying so much about your family, too.</font>

320
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,010
<font color="yellow">You should enjoy your life.</font>

321
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,370
<font color="yellow">You go ahead and enjoy yours.</font>

322
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,430
<font color="yellow">This is my life, and I'm satisfied with it.</font>

323
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,850
<font color="yellow">As you're getting older, you're starting to hide your feelings more.</font>

324
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,580
<font color="yellow">Trying to be responsible all the time must burden you at times.</font>

325
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,330
<font color="yellow">You'll know when you're older.</font>

326
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,400
<font color="yellow">Right. I'm still a baby, so I don't understand those things.</font>

327
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,290
<font color="yellow">I'll have fun for the rest of my life.</font>

328
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,850
<font color="yellow">Don't take your life so seriously.</font>

329
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
<font color="yellow">Tell them to come out.</font>

330
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,980
<font color="yellow">Somebody must take responsibility for what happened.</font>

331
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,080
<font color="yellow">They killed a hard-working employee and call it an accident?</font>

332
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,300
<font color="yellow">- How can they just say that?
-  Mum, stop.</font>

333
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,450
<font color="yellow">- Accident?
-  Mum, please.</font>

334
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,780
<font color="yellow">- Please calm down.
-  Find whoever that is responsible.</font>

335
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,440
<font color="yellow">How could this happen? How?</font>

336
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,580
<font color="yellow">How is this possible?</font>

337
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,420
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

338
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,520
<font color="yellow">Why did she drink so much?</font>

339
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,550
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

340
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,720
<font color="yellow">My blood was boiling because of someone,</font>

341
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,280
<font color="yellow">so I drank a little.</font>

342
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,220
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

343
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,390
<font color="yellow">I know that you...</font>

344
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,450
<font color="yellow">molest your female coworkers.</font>

345
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,920
<font color="yellow">What? I molest who?</font>

346
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,120
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking. You plagiarise other people's work.</font>

347
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,020
<font color="yellow">- I'm speechless.
-  What are dramas for?</font>

348
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,720
<font color="yellow">If you want to console and comfort the viewers through your drama,</font>

349
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,400
<font color="yellow">you cannot copy other people's work like that.</font>

350
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, sure thing.</font>

351
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,120
<font color="yellow">You're so righteous.</font>

352
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,420
<font color="yellow">I'm an irresponsible and reckless troublemaker,</font>

353
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,950
<font color="yellow">so I just steal from other people.</font>

354
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,980
<font color="yellow">I heard it's not even your drama.</font>

355
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,120
<font color="yellow">Taking responsibility for your own life is difficult enough.</font>

356
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,550
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure why you're being responsible for someone else's job,</font>

357
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,090
<font color="yellow">but being nosy like that will only complicate your life more.</font>

358
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,150
<font color="yellow">Thanks for your word of wisdom.</font>

359
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,980
<font color="yellow">I guess your life is so uncomplicated...</font>

360
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,200
<font color="yellow">because you always go by the book.</font>

361
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,320
<font color="yellow">That's probably why your family is happy and well, too.</font>

362
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,350
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

363
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,420
<font color="yellow">That's exactly why you don't belong here, so move out immediately.</font>

364
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,020
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

365
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,050
<font color="yellow">How long have you known me for?</font>

366
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,390
<font color="yellow">How dare you judge me and criticise me...</font>

367
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,630
<font color="yellow">when you don't even know anything about me?</font>

368
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,520
<font color="yellow">You're drunk. If you want to talk, do it when you're sober.</font>

369
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,980
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

370
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,770
<font color="yellow">This isn't no drunk talk.</font>

371
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,930
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'm a thief, a crook and a con artist.</font>

372
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,220
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

373
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,250
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

374
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,840
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind? Are you trying to molest me?</font>

375
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,850
<font color="yellow">No, I was...</font>

376
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,150
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. My hairpin.</font>

377
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,180
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, this is...
-  I didn't...</font>

378
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,750
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

379
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,580
<font color="yellow">Well, I was just...</font>

380
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,560
<font color="yellow">Well... Listen.</font>

381
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,980
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

382
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,080
<font color="yellow">You told me not to bother your family.</font>

383
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,260
<font color="yellow">Are you the only one who has family?</font>

384
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,970
<font color="yellow">Is your family the only thing that matters?</font>

385
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,770
<font color="yellow">Those who don't have family shouldn't even live, then.</font>

386
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,680
<font color="yellow">You must be so happy to have a family to protect.</font>

387
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,420
<font color="yellow">Do you think I live like this because I want to?</font>

388
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,880
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

389
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,920
<font color="yellow">calm down. About the hairpin, I...</font>

390
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,450
<font color="yellow">You're lucky I've gotten nice over the years.</font>

391
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

392
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,420
<font color="yellow">I thought things would change when I become a grown-up.</font>

393
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,590
<font color="yellow">I wanted to grow into an adult...</font>

394
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,420
<font color="yellow">who is graceful, serene and relaxed.</font>

395
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,250
<font color="yellow">"A thief moved into the house next door."</font>

396
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,680
<font color="yellow">"You just hide behind..."</font>

397
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,550
<font color="yellow">"and try to come up with ruses like a con artist."</font>

398
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,620
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

399
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,350
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

400
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,350
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

401
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,150
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd find peace and maturity as I grew older.</font>

402
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,050
<font color="yellow">The image of the adult I had in mind...</font>

403
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,080
<font color="yellow">was nothing like this.</font>

404
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,420
<font color="yellow">The image of the adult I had in mind...</font>

405
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,780
<font color="yellow">wasn't this.</font>

406
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,920
<font color="yellow">When will my car be available? I signed the contract so long ago.</font>

407
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
<font color="yellow">Please bring it to my place.</font>

408
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,680
<font color="yellow">Get on. You can't carry those alone.</font>

409
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,420
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

410
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,720
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

411
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,680
<font color="yellow">I don't want to have anything to do with your family.</font>

412
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,920
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

413
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,010
<font color="yellow">And I'm not his family. That means you can come with me.</font>

414
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,780
<font color="yellow">You still live with him.</font>

415
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,220
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Who installed the hardwood flooring?</font>

416
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
<font color="yellow">I did it.</font>

417
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,150
<font color="yellow">If you need to fix anything, I'll do it for you.</font>

418
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,180
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll figure it out.</font>

419
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,560
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way.</font>

420
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,820
<font color="yellow">Don't just stare at the clock and wait for me. Do something.</font>

421
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,150
<font color="yellow">You can sleep, read or watch TV.</font>

422
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,180
<font color="yellow">Then dropping the suit...</font>

423
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,250
<font color="yellow">We can't do that. It should not happen.</font>

424
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,180
<font color="yellow">What are dramas for?</font>

425
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,980
<font color="yellow">If you want to console and comfort the viewers through your drama,</font>

427
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,580
<font color="yellow">Jeong Sik.</font>

429
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,630
<font color="yellow">Are you editing the episode for today?</font>

430
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,720
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

431
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,350
<font color="yellow">- It didn't go well.
-  What?</font>

432
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,850
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

433
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,450
<font color="yellow">We should just admit that we plagiarised and...</font>

434
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,560
<font color="yellow">What in the world are you talking about?</font>

435
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,150
<font color="yellow">I'm busy, so let's talk later.</font>

436
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,120
<font color="yellow">Edit this out.</font>

437
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,950
<font color="yellow">You guys are working hard.</font>

438
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,920
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

439
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,180
<font color="yellow">Team Manager Han reviewed everything and just left for the day.</font>

440
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,100
<font color="yellow">You're sure that Jeong Sik left for the day, right?</font>

441
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,780
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  Are you almost done?</font>

442
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,120
<font color="yellow">Of course. It has to air soon.</font>

443
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,620
<font color="yellow">Turn off the TV if you aren't watching it.</font>

444
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,080
<font color="yellow">I'm going to watch the drama. It'll start shortly.</font>

445
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,720
<font color="yellow">("I Don't Love You Even If I Die")</font>

446
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,260
<font color="yellow">Why would you watch that?</font>

447
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,550
<font color="yellow">- Because it's fun.
-  Fun?</font>

448
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,760
<font color="yellow">- Doesn't it infuriate you?
-  Gosh!</font>

449
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,620
<font color="yellow">- No! Don't do that!
-  This drama...</font>

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,950
<font color="yellow">You know well.</font>

607
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,880
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you give them sophisticated names?</font>

608
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,650
<font color="yellow">How about Harry and Sally?</font>

609
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,950
<font color="yellow">Then they'd always argue.</font>

610
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,550
<font color="yellow">Did Young Hee and Cheol Soo live happily ever after?</font>

611
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,580
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

612
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,850
<font color="yellow">How do you know Harry and Sally?</font>

613
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,980
<font color="yellow">I watch movies, too.</font>

614
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,350
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

615
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,050
<font color="yellow">here you go.</font>

616
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,920
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

617
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,680
<font color="yellow">Your hairpin broke last time.</font>

618
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,450
<font color="yellow">I watched your drama.</font>

619
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,920
<font color="yellow">I told you to take responsibilities, not make trouble.</font>

620
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,750
<font color="yellow">I wasn't confident enough to be responsible,</font>

621
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,520
<font color="yellow">so I made trouble instead.</font>

622
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,850
<font color="yellow">Why did you make such a bold decision?</font>

623
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,150
<font color="yellow">If there aren't any expedients or settlements,</font>

624
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,750
<font color="yellow">we have to follow the rules.</font>

625
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,220
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I try to deny it,</font>

626
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,220
<font color="yellow">the truth is always revealed.</font>

627
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,290
<font color="yellow">To make up for what you did, are you unable to go to work?</font>

628
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,380
<font color="yellow">The worst thing that could happen is getting fired.</font>

629
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,630
<font color="yellow">It seems like you've led...</font>

630
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,960
<font color="yellow">a very comfortable life.</font>

631
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,150
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

632
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,080
<font color="yellow">Compared to others, it may be true.</font>

633
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,580
<font color="yellow">Why did you move to this neighbourhood?</font>

634
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,150
<font color="yellow">You could have stayed in Seoul.</font>

635
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to threaten me to move out again?</font>

636
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,220
<font color="yellow">May I come here sometimes?</font>

637
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,930
<font color="yellow">Come here sometimes and take walks.</font>

638
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,850
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything dangerous.</font>

639
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,630
<font color="yellow">You may not go enter the fountain again.</font>

640
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,930
<font color="yellow">And don't you dare come here alone.</font>

641
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,480
<font color="yellow">Are you being concerned for me,</font>

642
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,050
<font color="yellow">or are you concerned about this place?</font>

643
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,180
<font color="yellow">Obviously...</font>

644
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,520
<font color="yellow">It sounds better than telling me to move out immediately.</font>

645
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,590
<font color="yellow">- Let's go down.
-  I want to stay longer.</font>

646
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,220
<font color="yellow">I'm a busy man.</font>

647
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,150
<font color="yellow">All right, you go down first.</font>

648
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,380
<font color="yellow">Min Joo.</font>

649
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,400
<font color="yellow">- I'm glad I bumped into you.
-  Hello.</font>

650
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,860
<font color="yellow">Isn't the house great?</font>

651
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,390
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

652
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,410
<font color="yellow">You seem to have aged compared to the last time I saw you.</font>

653
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,880
<font color="yellow">You have more wrinkles. But I know you can't do anything about it.</font>

654
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,530
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me?
-  This is...</font>

655
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,100
<font color="yellow">a special gift for your moving here.</font>

656
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,620
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

657
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,350
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

658
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,250
<font color="yellow">It...</font>

659
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,450
<font color="yellow">tightens you up.</font>

660
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

661
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,880
<font color="yellow">What I mean is...</font>

662
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,950
<font color="yellow">it really tightens you up.</font>

663
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,050
<font color="yellow">How do I explain it?</font>

664
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,930
<font color="yellow">It's a supplement that's good for women who had menopause.</font>

665
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,730
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

666
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,860
<font color="yellow">Please accept it. Try it.</font>

667
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,350
<font color="yellow">It's effective when you eat it for a long time.</font>

668
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,240
<font color="yellow">I see. Thank you.</font>

669
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,250
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

670
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,680
<font color="yellow">- See you.
-  Bye.</font>

671
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,250
<font color="yellow">Who are you?

672
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,790
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

673
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,820
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

674
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,250
<font color="yellow">Hey! My goodness.</font>

675
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

676
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,650
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

677
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,440
<font color="yellow">It's my car.</font>

678
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,850
<font color="yellow">It's my new car.</font>

679
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:54,750
<font color="yellow">Your new car?</font>

680
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,350
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

681
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,580
<font color="yellow">If you're not a thief, why did you sneak into my house?</font>

682
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,450
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to talk?</font>

683
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,060
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

684
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,920
<font color="yellow">You've only been apologising.</font>

685
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,290
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

686
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,350
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

687
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,380
<font color="yellow">Tell your mum to come.</font>

688
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,950
<font color="yellow">Call her.</font>

689
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,620
<font color="yellow">I don't have a mum.</font>

690
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,050
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

691
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,620
<font color="yellow">I said I don't have a mum.</font>

692
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,120
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

693
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

694
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

695
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,720
<font color="yellow">call him Dad?</font>

696
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, she's my daughter.</font>

697
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,950
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji, what happened?</font>

698
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,420
<font color="yellow">I had left something at her place.</font>

699
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,420
<font color="yellow">When I went inside to take it,</font>

700
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,920
<font color="yellow">this old lady caught me.</font>

701
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,620
<font color="yellow">How unlucky.</font>

702
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,180
<font color="yellow">- What? "Old lady"?
-  What? "Unlucky"?</font>

703
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
<font color="yellow">Let me see it.</font>

704
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,880
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

705
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,880
<font color="yellow">Now.</font>

706
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,750
<font color="yellow">Is she...</font>

707
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,020
<font color="yellow">your daughter?</font>

708
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,880
<font color="yellow">What happened here?</font>

709
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,770
<font color="yellow">As you can see, it's a car I got today.</font>

710
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,980
<font color="yellow">Your daughter dropped a flower pot on top and...</font>

711
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,750
<font color="yellow">He had a daughter?</font>

712
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,120
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

713
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,990
<font color="yellow">(This is for the precious you.)</font>

714
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,290
<font color="yellow">"It strengthens the immune system..."</font>

<font color="yellow">"of women with menopause..."</font>

716
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,920
<font color="yellow">"and relieves stress."</font>

717
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

718
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,680
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

719
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,020
<font color="yellow">Did you fix the floor?</font>

720
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,440
<font color="yellow">- Not yet.
-  I knew it.</font>

721
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,870
<font color="yellow">It's all right. I'll do it. You can leave it.</font>

722
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,370
<font color="yellow">What are neighbours for?</font>

723
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,050
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

724
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,550
<font color="yellow">What happened to your finger?</font>

725
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,780
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing.
-  There it is.</font>

726
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,950
<font color="yellow">I sometimes get hurt when I cook, too.</font>

727
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,580
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat.
-  I said I'm fine.</font>

728
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,550
<font color="yellow">Come and have a seat.</font>

729
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,230
<font color="yellow">Your kitchen sink needs to be fixed.</font>

730
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,650
<font color="yellow">The living room floor that creaks also needs to be fixed.</font>

731
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,320
<font color="yellow">I'll fix it right away.</font>

732
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,150
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

733
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,160
<font color="yellow">Let me know if there's anything else you need to fix.</font>

734
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,480
<font color="yellow">I said I'll do it.</font>

735
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,220
<font color="yellow">You don't have a boyfriend, do you?</font>

736
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,620
<font color="yellow">You should ask men to do that.</font>

737
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,280
<font color="yellow">Goodness. That's why you don't have a boyfriend.</font>

738
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:31,880
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

739
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,710
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

740
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,390
<font color="yellow">It's because of your car.</font>

741
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,050
<font color="yellow">- Sang Sik.
-  Hey.</font>

742
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,720
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

743
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,580
<font color="yellow">- I came to fix something for her.
-  I see.</font>

744
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,900
<font color="yellow">There's...</font>

745
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,620
<font color="yellow">a good mechanic nearby.</font>

746
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,580
<font color="yellow">Call this number. I'm sorry about your new car.</font>

747
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,720
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

748
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,280
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

749
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,590
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji is here.</font>

750
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:57,780
<font color="yellow">Finish fixing it quickly so you can come join us for a meal.</font>

751
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,450
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

752
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,130
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo, you should go.</font>

753
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:03,240
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

754
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,470
<font color="yellow">I said I'll do it.</font>

755
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,880
<font color="yellow">I'll leave after fixing this.</font>

756
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,150
<font color="yellow">It's so loud.</font>

757
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,360
<font color="yellow">Let me see it.</font>

758
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,280
<font color="yellow">What's the big deal?</font>

759
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,220
<font color="yellow">- Why would you hide it?
-  Let it go.</font>

760
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,220
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

761
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,050
<font color="yellow">Why are you so loud?</font>

762
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:38,950
<font color="yellow">- Let's go upstairs.
-  Okay.</font>

763
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji.</font>

764
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,850
<font color="yellow">Come and sit here.</font>

765
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,650
<font color="yellow">Good luck. You'll be fine.</font>

766
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,080
<font color="yellow">Give it back.</font>

767
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,880
<font color="yellow">Great job, Ye Ji.</font>

768
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,550
<font color="yellow">Why would you embarrass yourself just for these photos?</font>

769
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,510
<font color="yellow">I didn't know anyone moved in already.</font>

770
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,950
<font color="yellow">I left it at Jun Woo's place before.</font>

771
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,270
<font color="yellow">Why did you hide it at that house?</font>

772
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,140
<font color="yellow">I didn't leave it here because you don't respect my taste.</font>

773
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,250
<font color="yellow">I'm going to subtract the cost...</font>

774
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,130
<font color="yellow">of the car repair from your monthly allowance.</font>

775
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,250
<font color="yellow">- Dad.
-  And this.</font>

776
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,220
<font color="yellow">Just leave this book here.</font>

777
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,850
<font color="yellow">I'm your only parent, okay?</font>

778
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,820
<font color="yellow">Will you hide and keep secrets from me or not?</font>

779
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,450
<font color="yellow">As long as you don't nag me.</font>

780
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,320
<font color="yellow">Will you or not?</font>

781
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,760
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

782
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,780
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

783
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,880
<font color="yellow">Why is there so much?</font>

784
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,880
<font color="yellow">Look at his silly hairstyle.</font>

785
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:57,980
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

786
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,020
<font color="yellow">(House ghost)</font>

787
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,580
<font color="yellow">(The Grim Reaper)</font>

788
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,810
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  Hey.</font>

789
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:33,790
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you for a long time.</font>

790
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,830
<font color="yellow">Since I move too violently...</font>

791
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,860
<font color="yellow">every night after class, all the beads on my nail chipped off.</font>

792
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,950
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

793
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,980
<font color="yellow">This is your first time at our shop.</font>

794
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,840
<font color="yellow">What do you do for a living?</font>

795
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,850
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

796
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,610
<font color="yellow">do this and that.</font>

797
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,650
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
-  You must own many businesses.</font>

798
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,980
<font color="yellow">That's not...</font>

799
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

800
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,900
<font color="yellow">Your wife must be so happy.</font>

801
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,620
<font color="yellow">I want to get married soon.</font>

802
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,780
<font color="yellow">Being married isn't always a good thing.</font>

803
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,920
<font color="yellow">Rather than regretting your marriage...</font>

804
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,680
<font color="yellow">or getting a divorce,</font>

805
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,980
<font color="yellow">being single is more peaceful.</font>

806
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,350
<font color="yellow">You're alone in life anyway.</font>

807
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,230
<font color="yellow">You must've gotten a divorce like me.</font>

808
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,450
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I didn't know.</font>

809
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,320
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

810
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,450
<font color="yellow">At this age,</font>

811
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,520
<font color="yellow">I don't want to work, and I also feel empty.</font>

812
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,100
<font color="yellow">I kept losing confidence.</font>

813
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,280
<font color="yellow">I came here thinking I should at least take care of my looks.</font>

814
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,620
<font color="yellow">You still look young.</font>

815
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,220
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

816
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,450
<font color="yellow">You don't have muscles compared to your looks.</font>

817
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,280
<font color="yellow">Make time to stop by.</font>

818
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,750
<font color="yellow">You have to exercise by making time, not when you have time.</font>

819
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,450
<font color="yellow">I can see that.</font>

820
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,150
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

821
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,280
<font color="yellow">Did you take your car to the mechanic?</font>

822
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,780
<font color="yellow">Hello? I'm talking to you.</font>

823
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,380
<font color="yellow">Why are you dressed like that when it's hot outside?</font>

824
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,650
<font color="yellow">I'm going to see a dermatologist.</font>

825
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,900
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face? Did you eat something wrong?</font>

826
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,430
<font color="yellow">You told me not to get involved with your family,</font>

827
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,730
<font color="yellow">but your family gets involved with me. Do you know that?</font>

828
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:27,820
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with...</font>

829
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,820
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

830
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,550
<font color="yellow">It happened after I took these.</font>

831
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,200
<font color="yellow">Your sister, Sang Hee, gave them to me.</font>

832
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,850
<font color="yellow">Is she still selling these?</font>

833
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,890
<font color="yellow">Give them back.</font>

834
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,360
<font color="yellow">I'm going to ask the doctor if there are any side effects.</font>

835
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,610
<font color="yellow">Wait, why did you take these?</font>

836
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,050
<font color="yellow">It's because she gave them to me. She said it'll tighten...</font>

837
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,980
<font color="yellow">Immune system? Stress?</font>

838
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,020
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

839
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,550
<font color="yellow">Wait...</font>

840
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,450
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

841
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,180
<font color="yellow">You didn't come home when I told you to.</font>

842
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,750
<font color="yellow">Why did you give these to her when you know there are side effects?</font>

843
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,050
<font color="yellow">The thing is, I couldn't help it.</font>

844
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,310
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

845
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,640
<font color="yellow">My husband has been working as a teacher for a while,</font>

846
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,650
<font color="yellow">but he isn't getting promoted.</font>

847
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,850
<font color="yellow">He doesn't really...</font>

848
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,720
<font color="yellow">get along with his superiors, either.</font>

849
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,450
<font color="yellow">You know that already.</font>

850
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,450
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

851
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,250
<font color="yellow">The school principal's wife sells these,</font>

852
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,680
<font color="yellow">so how can I not do anything?</font>

853
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,020
<font color="yellow">Where's Cheon Soo?</font>

854
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,910
<font color="yellow">I don't know. He gets off work late these days.</font>

855
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,600
<font color="yellow">He also works out of town often.</font>

856
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,410
<font color="yellow">He doesn't answer my calls.</font>

857
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,120
<font color="yellow">Then why bother doing this for him?</font>

858
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,380
<font color="yellow">It's because I love him.</font>

859
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,390
<font color="yellow">I love him very much.</font>

860
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:53,650
<font color="yellow">I did it because I wanted my family to live happily.</font>

861
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:57,530
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

862
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,380
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

863
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,950
<font color="yellow">Uncle Sang Sik, what's going on?</font>

864
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,550
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

865
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,420
<font color="yellow">I think my acne is getting worse because of these.</font>

866
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,330
<font color="yellow">When did you take them?</font>

867
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,250
<font color="yellow">They're only for women.</font>

868
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,820
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

869
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,980
<font color="yellow">Hello, Min Joo.</font>

870
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,020
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face?</font>

871
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,380
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

872
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,980
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you? Since you don't date,</font>

873
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,140
<font color="yellow">you have hormonal imbalance which causes the skin to break out.</font>

874
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,350
<font color="yellow">That's not why.</font>

875
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,030
<font color="yellow">Then how did it happen?</font>

876
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,680
<font color="yellow">It's all because of my neighbour.</font>

877
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,580
<font color="yellow">- Neighbour?
-  Yes.</font>

878
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:45,060
<font color="yellow">My skin broke out, and my car broke.</font>

879
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,410
<font color="yellow">I'm frustrated.</font>

880
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,820
<font color="yellow">Why would a new car break?</font>

881
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,720
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

882
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,080
<font color="yellow">- My gosh.
-  What happened to you?</font>

883
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,110
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

884
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,580
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

885
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,930
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

886
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,620
<font color="yellow">What are you doing these days?</font>

887
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,450
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

888
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,650
<font color="yellow">I'm busy teaching children at school.</font>

889
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,280
<font color="yellow">You don't teach this late.</font>

890
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,350
<font color="yellow">Go home. Be good to my sister...</font>

891
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,020
<font color="yellow">I mean, to your wife, okay?</font>

892
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,290
<font color="yellow">You're done for if I catch you cheating.</font>

893
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,420
<font color="yellow">Why would I cheat?</font>

894
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,350
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

895
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,850
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

896
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,950
<font color="yellow">did she get in trouble again?</font>

897
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,020
<font color="yellow">Go in and ask her yourself.</font>

898
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,980
<font color="yellow">Come and see Ye Ji at her final match.</font>

899
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,280
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. She'll win even if I'm not there.</font>

900
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,050
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no.
-  Don't get rid of them.</font>

901
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,850
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  Sir, please.</font>

902
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,850
<font color="yellow">Posting these up here is illegal.</font>

903
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,950
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

904
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:03,270
<font color="yellow">If you won't help me take these down, leave.</font>

905
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,540
<font color="yellow">- He's so terrible.
-  My gosh.</font>

906
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,070
<font color="yellow">- You're so bossy.
-  Goodness.</font>

907
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,020
<font color="yellow">Why you rascals...</font>

908
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,950
<font color="yellow">- Goodness.
-  My gosh.</font>

909
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,180
<font color="yellow">Why do they like them so much?</font>

910
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,320
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

911
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,720
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's you. I was checking the street.</font>

912
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:19,550
<font color="yellow">You're checking what?</font>

913
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,780
<font color="yellow">For a district government worker, all public service is my duty.</font>

914
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,020
<font color="yellow">If illegal posters are on the walls in my district,</font>

915
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,870
<font color="yellow">it's my job to take them off.</font>

916
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:28,950
<font color="yellow">That's amazing.</font>

917
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,150
<font color="yellow">They're the most popular these days.</font>

918
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,980
<font color="yellow">Do you even know them?</font>

919
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,720
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

920
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,450
<font color="yellow">You're treating me like an old man.</font>

921
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,650
<font color="yellow">These are tickets to the concert on this poster.</font>

<font color="yellow">If you have time this Saturday, go with your daughter.</font>

923
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,750
<font color="yellow">Why would an adult like you give these out?</font>

924
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,220
<font color="yellow">The band members came to say hello and gave me...</font>

925
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,550
<font color="yellow">these tickets to promote their concert.</font>

926
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,710
<font color="yellow">You're also popular among young idol members, are you?</font>

927
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,220
<font color="yellow">I'm giving these to you...</font>

928
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,620
<font color="yellow">because your daughter came to apologise to me.</font>

929
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,800
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji did?</font>

930
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,320
<font color="yellow">She was polite.</font>

931
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,420
<font color="yellow">Do you want them or not?</font>

932
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,150
<font color="yellow">If it's this Saturday,</font>

933
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,320
<font color="yellow">I can't go.</font>

<font color="yellow">She must be very smart.</font>

936
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,600
<font color="yellow">Not only is she smart,</font>

937
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,760
<font color="yellow">but she's also talented in extracurricular activities.</font>

938
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,120
<font color="yellow">She's smart because she takes after me.</font>

939
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,580
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

940
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,020
<font color="yellow">Then leave.</font>

941
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,250
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

942
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:40,780
<font color="yellow">It seems like your face got better. I could be wrong.</font>

943
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,180
<font color="yellow">Let's go to that concert together.</font>

944

<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

945
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,320
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face?</font>

949
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,380

950

<font color="yellow">Let's go to the concert together.</font>

951
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,220
<font color="yellow">Why would I go to this concert?</font>

952
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,840
<font color="yellow">Instead of pretending to be an adult,</font>

953
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,820
<font color="yellow">listening to music without thinking like children...</font>

954
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,320

<font color="yellow">How did you know, Dad?</font>

960
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,050
<font color="yellow">Your uncle told me.</font>

969
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,990
<font color="yellow">You told me to live up to your words.</font>

970
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,820
<font color="yellow">You can do it. I love you.</font>

971

<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

977
