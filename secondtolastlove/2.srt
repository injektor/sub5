57
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,240
<font color="yellow">with the local tourist department, so we're...</font>

58
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,940
<font color="yellow">So are you saying that...</font>

59
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,590
<font color="yellow">earning money from local tourism is all that matters?</font>

60
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,830
<font color="yellow">Do you mean you don't care about tourists' lives...</font>

61
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,540
<font color="yellow">because we're neither in charge of safety nor maintenance?</font>

62
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,760
<font color="yellow">Is this what everyone thinks?</font>

63
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,110
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  No, Sir.</font>

64
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,870
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is Local Tourist Department.</font>

65
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,470
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

66
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,900
<font color="yellow">Tell me who's in charge of the bungee jump.</font>

67
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,910

68
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,340
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

69
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,810
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll be on my way,</font>

70
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,170
<font color="yellow">so tell him to stay right there.</font>

71
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,710
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko Sang Sik?</font>

72
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,910
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

73
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,440

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,510

<font color="yellow">Choose the one that fits you.</font>

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,170
<font color="yellow">How's the filming going?</font>

78
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,140
<font color="yellow">Did you stop filming?</font>

79
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,610
<font color="yellow">Well, yes.</font>

80
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,350
<font color="yellow">So what's happening?</font>

81
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,540
<font color="yellow">I don't think bungee jumping is possible.</font>

82

<font color="yellow">We decided to change it to another scene.</font>

83
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,570
<font color="yellow">Then you should've done that earlier!</font>

84

<font color="yellow">Is it common sense not to check the facility...</font>

101

<font color="yellow">before our filming?</font>

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
<font color="yellow">Common sense?</font>

103
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,340
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you dare to even say that.</font>

104
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,830

105
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,540

<font color="yellow">If you were to film at a bungee jump,</font>

107
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,610
<font color="yellow">you should have contacted the facility department.</font>

108
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,070
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have risked...</font>

<font color="yellow">your life if you had followed the basic rules.</font>

110

111
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,240
<font color="yellow">at a site where we hadn't finished checking the facilities?</font>

114
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,340

115
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,580
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

116
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,140
<font color="yellow">that you're proud of putting my life at risk?</font>

117

<font color="yellow">A government official who should serve the citizens...</font>

118
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,140
<font color="yellow">should apologise first when something like this happens.</font>

119

129
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,240
<font color="yellow">What kind of person are you?</font>

130
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,840
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you ever again, either.</font>

131
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,420
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm not capable of swearing and talking casually?</font>

132
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,510

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,340
<font color="yellow">we're still government employees. Right, Chief Ko?</font>

142
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,770
<font color="yellow">You must abide by government rules.</font>

143
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,620
<font color="yellow">I had already signed the official document of authorisation,</font>

144
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,410
<font color="yellow">so you should've followed my orders and taken responsibility.</font>

145
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,850
<font color="yellow">I wasn't informed that they'd be filming at the bungee jump site.</font>

146
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,230
<font color="yellow">We already gave them permission to film at the entire site.</font>

147
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,410
<font color="yellow">You should have let them be.</font>

148
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,410
<font color="yellow">I noticed that Cha Soo Hyuk is in charge of the bungee jump site.</font>

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,910
<font color="yellow">Doesn't he work in your department?</font>

150
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,610
<font color="yellow">Yes, he does.</font>

151
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,810
<font color="yellow">What shall I do?</font>

152
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,010
<font color="yellow">You need to take disciplinary action for what happened.</font>

153
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,840
<font color="yellow">It's true that Cha Soo Hyuk is in charge,</font>

154
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,140
<font color="yellow">but there's no reason for him to take responsibility.</font>

155
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,610
<font color="yellow">How so?</font>

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,640
<font color="yellow">He was checking maintenance according to his schedule.</font>

157
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,340
<font color="yellow">But after the filming was permitted,</font>

158
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,140
<font color="yellow">I should have given him specific orders, but I didn't.</font>

159
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,840
<font color="yellow">I'll take the responsibility as well as the disciplinary action.</font>

160
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,110
<font color="yellow">In that case, you will...</font>

161
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,570
<font color="yellow">no longer have a chance to win an award from the prime minister.</font>

162
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,110
<font color="yellow">Are you all right with that?</font>

163
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,910
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

164
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

165
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,270
<font color="yellow">Then please guide the production team...</font>

166
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,570
<font color="yellow">with the remaining filming schedule.</font>

167
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,970
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

168
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,010
<font color="yellow">A drama?</font>

169
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,940
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

170
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,770
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

171
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,600
<font color="yellow">My gosh. This is amazing. Goodness.</font>

172
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,930
<font color="yellow">Isn't it incredible?</font>

173
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,940
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

174
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,570
<font color="yellow">It's fun, isn't it?</font>

175
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,810
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang.</font>

176
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,730
<font color="yellow">You almost died, Min Joo.</font>

177
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,040
<font color="yellow">We almost lost you there.</font>

178
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,470
<font color="yellow">Gosh, stop watching it.</font>

179
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,340
<font color="yellow">Wow, this looks amazing.</font>

180
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,470
<font color="yellow">It's not amazing at all.</font>

181
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know who he is, but he saved your life.</font>

182
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,910
<font color="yellow">- Can we zoom in on his face?
-  Okay.</font>

183
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,170
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

184
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,420
<font color="yellow">The invincible Kang Min Joo...</font>

185
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,470
<font color="yellow">let go of herself to him.</font>

186
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,230
<font color="yellow">You got that right.</font>

187
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,030
<font color="yellow">My goodness. That's true.</font>

188
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,640
<font color="yellow">Are you going to continue?</font>

189
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,410
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

190
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,040
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to go all the way there?</font>

191
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,230
<font color="yellow">I had to get the permission to film, but I also wondered...</font>

192
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,170
<font color="yellow">what it'd be like to live there.</font>

193
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,740
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you going to start farming?</font>

194
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,910
<font color="yellow">Isn't it a great place to live if I'm going to live alone anyway?</font>

195
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're determined to live alone.</font>

196
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,060
<font color="yellow">Don't be so picky about men.</font>

197
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,340
<font color="yellow">If I had time to be picky, why would I even look for a place like that?</font>

198
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,810
<font color="yellow">You talk like you're getting ready for old age.</font>

199
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,610
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for a retirement home?</font>

200
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,540
<font color="yellow">Are you really planning to move there?</font>

201
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,290
<font color="yellow">She's beautiful.</font>

202
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,340
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

203
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,440
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

204
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,010
<font color="yellow">You could have just sent me an email.</font>

205
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,930
<font color="yellow">Telling you this in person is the right thing to do.</font>

206
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,100
<font color="yellow">It's my first piece of work anyway.</font>

207
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,910
<font color="yellow">I have to read the script first...</font>

208
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,840
<font color="yellow">to accept it as your first work.</font>

209
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,530
<font color="yellow">This is the edited version...</font>

210
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,470
<font color="yellow">where I applied all of your suggestions.</font>

211
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,340
<font color="yellow">I'll take a look at the script since you're tired.</font>

212
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,710
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

213
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,400
<font color="yellow">I'm going to read it in every detail at home.</font>

214
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,640
<font color="yellow">You don't have to read it in such detail.</font>

215
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,940
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

216
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,860
<font color="yellow">That workaholic. Take care of yourself first...</font>

217
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,910
<font color="yellow">instead of going to a sanatorium.</font>

218
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,670
<font color="yellow">A sanatorium?</font>

219
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,820
<font color="yellow">I thought you were dead, but you're still alive.</font>

220
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,410
<font color="yellow">What a great thing to say to a person who almost died.</font>

221
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,660
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

222
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
<font color="yellow">You're not a police officer.</font>

223
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,910
<font color="yellow">You should be aware of your position.</font>

224
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,870
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to find a graveyard for you?</font>

225
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,340
<font color="yellow">Let's see who dies first between us two.</font>

226
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

227
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,510
<font color="yellow">- Here.
-  What is it again?</font>

228
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,850
<font color="yellow">I don't want to look at it. It will make me throw up.</font>

229
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,240
<font color="yellow">You should get married.</font>

230
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,140
<font color="yellow">She was a nurse at a hospital when she was young.</font>

231
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,270
<font color="yellow">She looks young and pretty.</font>

232
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,770
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Give me a drink.</font>

233
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,270
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

234
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,540
<font color="yellow">have a problem down there?</font>

235
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,810
<font color="yellow">I'm not old enough to look for a hospice worker yet.</font>

236
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,170
<font color="yellow">Don't treat me like that when I'm being a friend to you.</font>

237
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,370
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

238
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,170
<font color="yellow">I killed him.</font>

239
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,870
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

246
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,110
<font color="yellow">I just arrived.</font>

247
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,370
<font color="yellow">Shall I come inside?</font>

248
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

249
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,120
<font color="yellow">You can't even dream of living in a house like this in Seoul.</font>

250
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,920
<font color="yellow">The air is fresh, the view is great and it's cheap.</font>

251
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,160
<font color="yellow">It's quiet and peaceful.</font>

252
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,400
<font color="yellow">There's a hospital nearby, and the police station is very close.</font>

253
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,250
<font color="yellow">You have a good eye.</font>

254
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,910
<font color="yellow">By the way, how many family members do you have?</font>

255
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,810
<font color="yellow">I'll be living alone.</font>

256
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,550
<font color="yellow">I knew it. I was thinking that you look very stylish.</font>

257
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,520
<font color="yellow">You must be an eligible bachelorette with a great career.</font>

<font color="yellow">Thank you for showing me the house.</font>

259
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,240
<font color="yellow">Please don't forget to call me. I should get back to work.</font>

260
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,670
<font color="yellow">Is this a house or a cafe?</font>

261
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,510
<font color="yellow">We meet again.</font>

262
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,670
<font color="yellow">Get on.</font>

263
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,640
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to get on?</font>

264
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,910
<font color="yellow">You'll regret it.</font>

265
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,280
<font color="yellow">You might fall off if you stay like that.</font>

266
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,790
<font color="yellow">This is quince tea.</font>

267
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,740
<font color="yellow">I made it because you seem tired, and you look like you have a cold.</font>

268
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

269
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,610
<font color="yellow">It'll be hot.</font>

270
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,610
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Thank you for the other day.</font>

271
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,440
<font color="yellow">If you're here for dinner, here's our menu.</font>

272
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,910
<font color="yellow">No, I came to look at the house next door.</font>

273
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,840
<font color="yellow">- You came to see the house?
-  Yes.</font>

274
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,540
<font color="yellow">That house is pretty nice.</font>

275
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,360
<font color="yellow">I know, right? I really like it too, so...</font>

276
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,540
<font color="yellow">You should move there. Then we'll see each other often.</font>

277
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,170
<font color="yellow">Do you live in this neighbourhood?</font>

278
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,710
<font color="yellow">I live right here.</font>

279
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,880
<font color="yellow">You must be the owner of this cafe.</font>

280
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,210
<font color="yellow">I guess I might get another regular customer.</font>

281
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,170
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved.</font>

282
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

283
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,510
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm glad to have a good next-door neighbour.</font>

284
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,640
<font color="yellow">You won't turn a blind eye when something happens to me.</font>

285
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,200
<font color="yellow">What kind of things?</font>

286
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,470
<font color="yellow">In life, you never know when you'll end up in an ambulance or...</font>

287
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,440
<font color="yellow">At my age, it's...</font>

288
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,140
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

289
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,280
<font color="yellow">You look very young, though.</font>

290
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,010
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

291
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,170
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I'll become your regular customer.</font>

292
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,810
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

293
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,570
<font color="yellow">- Just a moment.
-  Sure.</font>

294
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,510
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
-  Cheers.</font>

295
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,140
<font color="yellow">We have to go to work tomorrow.</font>

296
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,310
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking and go home.</font>

297
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,440
<font color="yellow">He's talking like an old fogey again.</font>

298
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,840
<font color="yellow">Fogey?</font>

299
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,810
<font color="yellow">I said we shouldn't come here.</font>

300
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,710
<font color="yellow">We should've just gone out for drinks ourselves.</font>

301
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,230
<font color="yellow">When did I ask you guys to come here?</font>

302
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,130
<font color="yellow">This place is my sanctuary, so don't ever come here again.</font>

303
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,910
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chief! We'll remember that!</font>

304
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,340
<font color="yellow">Let's never come here again.</font>

305
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,340
<font color="yellow">Let's go! Come on.</font>

306
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,210
<font color="yellow">Why are you kicking out my customers?</font>

307
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,350
<font color="yellow">Those youngsters are livening up the mood here.</font>

308
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,640
<font color="yellow">They called me an old fogey.</font>

309
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,660
<font color="yellow">Right, so stop nagging them. It shows that you've gotten old.</font>

310
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,740
<font color="yellow">Just change the music. It's way too loud.</font>

311
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,210
<font color="yellow">Goodness gracious.</font>

312
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,810
<font color="yellow">It's this Saturday.</font>

313
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,020
<font color="yellow">What is?</font>

314
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,370
<font color="yellow">That lady I told you about! The blind date.</font>

315
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I told you that I'm not interested.</font>

316
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,040
<font color="yellow">I'm doing more than fine.</font>

317
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,510
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Are you going on a blind date, Chief?</font>

318
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,170
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to bring that up?</font>

319
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,540
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Chief!</font>

320
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,010
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

321
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,940
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

322
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,540
<font color="yellow">Even my female colleagues treat me like this.</font>

323
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,810
<font color="yellow">Those weird magazines definitely made things worse for you.</font>

324
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,740
<font color="yellow">What magazines?</font>

325
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,870
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

326
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,040
<font color="yellow">Men are ridiculous.</font>

327
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,870
<font color="yellow">Women are ridiculous.</font>

328
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,640
<font color="yellow">Officer Cha.</font>

329
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,880
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't want to join us for dinner.</font>

330
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,750
<font color="yellow">We're all done now.</font>

331
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,810
<font color="yellow">Where is Chief Ko?</font>

332
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,290
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

333
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,970
<font color="yellow">Why did you say that to the deputy mayor?</font>

334
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,960
<font color="yellow">I heard you can no longer get the Prime Minister Award because of me.</font>

335
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,400
<font color="yellow">Getting the award will guarantee a promotion as well as a bonus.</font>

336
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,840
<font color="yellow">If you know that, be good to me. Don't cause any more trouble.</font>

337
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,040
<font color="yellow">Please allow me to take responsibility.</font>

338
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,280
<font color="yellow">Responsibility?</font>

339
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,940
<font color="yellow">How will you do so?</font>

340
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,560
<font color="yellow">I will gladly accept any reprimand.</font>

341
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,320
<font color="yellow">Just work harder with that mindset.</font>

342
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,210
<font color="yellow">- Chief.
-  If you cause another trouble,</font>

343
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,340
<font color="yellow">I won't let it slide.</font>

344
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,670
<font color="yellow">It's because of that incident, isn't it?</font>

345
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,120
<font color="yellow">I know because I've heard enough about you.</font>

346
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,050
<font color="yellow">You're a very responsible person,</font>

347
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,140
<font color="yellow">and you try to take responsibility for anything that happens. That's...</font>

348
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,910
<font color="yellow">Don't talk like you know everything.</font>

349
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,610
<font color="yellow">Things like this happen because you work halfheartedly and clumsily.</font>

350
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,670
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth and behave yourself.</font>

351
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,740
<font color="yellow">Please take my seat, Ma'am.</font>

352
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,410
<font color="yellow">So you were in a different line of work before.</font>

353
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,310
<font color="yellow">Here, I also see what you studied in university.</font>

354
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,770
<font color="yellow">Have you given up on your dream completely?</font>

355
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,570
<font color="yellow">My dream?</font>

356
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,770
<font color="yellow">My family is my dream.</font>

357
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,270
<font color="yellow">Hurry up! Get out of here now!</font>

358
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,770
<font color="yellow">Don't let go of my hand!</font>

359
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

360
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,470
<font color="yellow">How much is this?</font>

361
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,170
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

362
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,910
<font color="yellow">I'll get it next time.</font>

363
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,670
<font color="yellow">This little...</font>

364
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

365
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,810
<font color="yellow">Help me carry this before I get mad at you.</font>

366
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,080
<font color="yellow">I can't because my golden hands are too precious.</font>

367
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,110
<font color="yellow">Golden hands?</font>

368
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,470
<font color="yellow">These golden fingers will rule the world.</font>

369
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,610
<font color="yellow">Golden fingers?</font>

370
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,970
<font color="yellow">Just don't get faeces on them.</font>

371
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,270
<font color="yellow">Your jokes are not funny at all.</font>

372
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,140
<font color="yellow">You fogey. Fine, I'll carry one for you.</font>

373
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,340
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm an old fogey.</font>

374
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,320
<font color="yellow">What are you up to these days? Why didn't you come home for days?</font>

375
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,810
<font color="yellow">- I've been busy with work.
-  What kind of work?</font>

376
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,170
<font color="yellow">- How's the job at the cafe going?
-  I got fired.</font>

377
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,610
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae!</font>

378
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,940
<font color="yellow">I work with guns these days.</font>

379
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,440
<font color="yellow">- Guns?
-  I work at a gas station.</font>

380
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,210
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

381
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,470
<font color="yellow">I hope you can keep that job at least.</font>

382
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,510
<font color="yellow">They said they don't need me any more.</font>

383
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,110
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

384
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,120
<font color="yellow">I put gasoline in a diesel engine.</font>

385
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,710
<font color="yellow">- You fool!
-  Ouch.</font>

386
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,940
<font color="yellow">I honestly don't know where you got your genes from.</font>

387
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,540
<font color="yellow">It's because you're on your phone all day long.</font>

388
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,490
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, I'm a grown-up now. Stop lecturing me.</font>

389
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,750
<font color="yellow">If you want to be treated like a grown-up, get a proper job.</font>

390
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,270
<font color="yellow">Job? Steve Jobs? Apple?</font>

391
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,810
<font color="yellow">- Shall I get a new phone?
-  Dear me.</font>

392
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,810
<font color="yellow">You can't even pay your own phone bills.</font>

393
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,670
<font color="yellow">Where's Ye Ji? She's not home yet?</font>

394
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,140
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

395
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,870
<font color="yellow">It looks like Sang Hee is busy meeting with Hoon's teachers.</font>

396
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,610
<font color="yellow">- Mind your own business.
-  All right.</font>

397
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,640
<font color="yellow">I can't breathe when I don't have my phone on me!</font>

398
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,820
<font color="yellow">Stop! You old fogey!</font>

399
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,140
<font color="yellow">- Old fogey?
-  Hey!</font>

400
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,170
<font color="yellow">Stop, you old man!</font>

401
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,640
<font color="yellow">Things like these can stay here. This one should go inside.</font>

402
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,270
<font color="yellow">Please be careful with the floor.</font>

403
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,740
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ae Kyung.</font>

404
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,440
<font color="yellow">You've fallen off the face of the earth.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

405
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,870
<font color="yellow">I moved today.</font>

406
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,210
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

407
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,870
<font color="yellow">So the city girl has finally left Seoul?</font>

408
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,770
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

409
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,270
<font color="yellow">It's amazing here.</font>

410
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,440
<font color="yellow">I feel as if I'm dreaming now!</font>

411
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,240
<font color="yellow">You silly. You should've told us.</font>

412
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,080
<font color="yellow">It's not like you know a buff guy who can help you.</font>

413
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,140
<font color="yellow">I can do it by myself.</font>

414
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,610
<font color="yellow">That's your problem. You're too independent.</font>

415
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,170
<font color="yellow">How's your next-door neighbour?</font>

416
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,240
<font color="yellow">He's a super handsome young guy.</font>

417
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,970
<font color="yellow">He's also very kind.</font>

418
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,310
<font color="yellow">A guy?</font>

419
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,320
<font color="yellow">He's not a married guy with kids, is he?</font>

420
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,440
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

421
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,140
<font color="yellow">When you visit me, you'll realise how stressful your lives have been.</font>

422
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,140
<font color="yellow">The air here is so fresh.</font>

423
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,640
<font color="yellow">Now, you just need a guy to live with.</font>

424
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,040
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

425
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,350
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'll eat delicious things alone...</font>

426
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,370
<font color="yellow">and take a walk and exercise all by myself here.</font>

427
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,140
<font color="yellow">I'll grow old graciously!</font>

428
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,310
<font color="yellow">My goodness, I'm tired.</font>

429
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,040
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

430
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

431
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,710
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

432
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,610
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

433
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

434
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,540
<font color="yellow">I wanted to welcome you with this.</font>

435
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

436
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

437
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,070
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Oh, no! Goodness!</font>

438
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,510
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

439
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,610
<font color="yellow">It's rice.</font>

440
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,580
<font color="yellow">I made rice with other grains.</font>

441
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,310
<font color="yellow">I've been having digestive problems.</font>

442
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,010
<font color="yellow">Just come over to my place for food.</font>

443
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,570
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, eat lunch before you go.</font>

444
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,650
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I don't have time.</font>

445
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why did you get changed all of a sudden?</font>

446
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,110
<font color="yellow">I need to follow a filming crew around in the afternoon.</font>

447
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,770
<font color="yellow">I've been told to monitor the filming site for a drama.</font>

448
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:42,810
<font color="yellow">A drama?</font>

449
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,830
<font color="yellow">This wouldn't have happened if they hadn't merged the departments.</font>

450
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,640
<font color="yellow">Aren't you a chief? Why are they making you do such a petty task?</font>

451
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,940
<font color="yellow">Something happened.</font>

452
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,080
<font color="yellow">It's all because of that crazy woman.</font>

453
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,440
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

454
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it looks delicious.</font>

455
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,870
<font color="yellow">You should eat before you leave.</font>

456
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,950
<font color="yellow">It's delicious. I'll see you later.</font>

457
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,030
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

458
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,110
<font color="yellow">You have a guest. Go.</font>

459
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,110
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

460
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,510
<font color="yellow">You're here. Please come in.</font>

461
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,510

464
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,070
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

465
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness!</font>

466
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,300
<font color="yellow">It looks like a work of art!</font>

467
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,310
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

468
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

469
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,070
<font color="yellow">It's so healthy, too!</font>

470
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,060
<font color="yellow">I can eat this, right?</font>

471
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,370
<font color="yellow">You already took a bite.</font>

472
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,570
<font color="yellow">Come by often for food.</font>

473
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,110
<font color="yellow">I should. You're such a great cook.</font>

474
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,470
<font color="yellow">How did you make this?</font>

<font color="yellow">(Comma's Cooking Class for Vegan Desserts)</font>

476
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,540
<font color="yellow">If you want to know, you should check out the class.</font>

477
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,210
<font color="yellow">It looked like you could use some help when it comes to cooking.</font>

478
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,470
<font color="yellow">You teach classes at your cafe, too?</font>

479
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,010
<font color="yellow">Once a week. It's free.</font>

480
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,270
<font color="yellow">I teach healthy recipes...</font>

481
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,270
<font color="yellow">for beginners and people who aren't confident with cooking.</font>

482
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,210
<font color="yellow">Then it's perfect for someone like me.</font>

483
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,910
<font color="yellow">How's your house?</font>

484
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,440
<font color="yellow">I don't know who the former tenant was, but it's well taken care of...</font>

485
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,370
<font color="yellow">and decorated tastefully, as well.</font>

486
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,400
<font color="yellow">The person probably didn't want to move.</font>

487
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,810
<font color="yellow">A few small things need repairs, though.</font>

488
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,750
<font color="yellow">The first door of the kitchen cabinet won't close properly.</font>

489
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,140
<font color="yellow">The hardwood floor will make a little squeaky sound, too.</font>

490
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,140
<font color="yellow">The floor in the bedroom isn't even, so the bed won't be levelled.</font>

491
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,840
<font color="yellow">I suggest you put something underneath to level it.</font>

492

<font color="yellow">I used to live in that house.</font>

493

<font color="yellow">Seriously? Then why...</font>

494
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,150
<font color="yellow">I just feel comfortable living here.</font>

495
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,370
<font color="yellow">I like the people that live here, and I'm pretty close to them.</font>

496
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,710
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

497
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,670
<font color="yellow">Feel free to let me know if you need help with anything.</font>

<font color="yellow">Kang Min Joo.</font>

504
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:09,370
<font color="yellow">Preserve the site. Be punctual and safe. You must follow the rules.</font>

505
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,910
<font color="yellow">Okay, we will do so.</font>

506
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,270
<font color="yellow">This place will look incredible when the construction is completed.</font>

507
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,010
<font color="yellow">A cinema in a cave.</font>

508

<font color="yellow">What are all those things?</font>

510
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,110
<font color="yellow">Those are our props.</font>

511
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,770
<font color="yellow">In the drama, this cave is portrayed as where people come to make wishes.</font>

512
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,410
<font color="yellow">They're sticky notes with couples' wishes.</font>

513
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,940
<font color="yellow">I don't really care to know. Just make sure to clean up everything.</font>

514
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,950
<font color="yellow">Okay, we will.</font>

515
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,510
<font color="yellow">Please don't worry too much.</font>

516
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,240
<font color="yellow">How can I not worry?</font>

517
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,710
<font color="yellow">You're shooting the drama when the construction isn't even over.</font>

518
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,640
<font color="yellow">You cannot go late. You can only shoot until 6pm.</font>

519
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,370
<font color="yellow">I heard you. How many times are you going to repeat yourself?</font>

520
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,890
<font color="yellow">We don't have enough time! Hurry up!</font>

521
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,050
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Okay.</font>

522
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,920
<font color="yellow">Nothing will collapse or break here, right?</font>

523
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,200
<font color="yellow">You're still going on about the bungee jump.</font>

524
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,910
<font color="yellow">It could've killed a person. Our team manager, to be more specific.</font>

525
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,810
<font color="yellow">Oh, the mayor is here.</font>

526
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

527
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,470
<font color="yellow">Sir, this is Chief Ko Sang Sik.</font>

528
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,710
<font color="yellow">It's very nice to meet you. I heard you're great at your job.</font>

529
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,250
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no.
-  Please don't be so modest.</font>

530
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,340
<font color="yellow">I heard you're the one who came up with the idea...</font>

531
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,170
<font color="yellow">of turning this useless abandoned mine into a cinema.</font>

532
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. We're working on it right now, but...</font>

533
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,040
<font color="yellow">He has contributed greatly to making this city a better place to live.</font>

534
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,810
<font color="yellow">- Spare me a second.
-  Sure.</font>

535
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,270
<font color="yellow">I actually pestered him about coming here...</font>

536
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,210
<font color="yellow">because I love this drama so much.</font>

537
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,170
<font color="yellow">I see. I'm glad that you were able to visit today.</font>

538
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,570
<font color="yellow">Please come with me.</font>

539
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,970
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

540
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,530
<font color="yellow">- Hello!
-  Hello.</font>

541
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,840
<font color="yellow">- Have a good day.
-  You, too.</font>

542
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't embarrass me.</font>

543
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,510
<font color="yellow">It's really fine.</font>

544
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,990
<font color="yellow">Please take it back.</font>

545
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,200
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to.</font>

546
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,630
<font color="yellow">You're putting me in a difficult position. Please take it back.</font>

547
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,340
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're the one who's putting me in a difficult position.</font>

548
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,340
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What's he doing now?</font>

549
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,840
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

550
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,740
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

551
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,940
<font color="yellow">You're here. Come this way.</font>

552
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,870
<font color="yellow">He's the mayor.</font>

553
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,310
<font color="yellow">Who's the woman beside him?</font>

554
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,710
<font color="yellow">His wife.</font>

555
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

556
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,740
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

557
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,580
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

558
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,410
<font color="yellow">Oh, this is Producer Kang Min Joo.</font>

559
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,180
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hello.</font>

560
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,270
<font color="yellow">Why is that woman here?</font>

561
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,610
<font color="yellow">I'm a huge fan of your drama.</font>

562
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see. Thank you.</font>

563
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,590
<font color="yellow">By the way, when will the male lead come to...</font>

564
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,970
<font color="yellow">Gosh, stop it.</font>

565
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,810
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with being his fan? I love him, too.</font>

566
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,010
<font color="yellow">I'll introduce you to him in a bit and get you his autograph, too.</font>

567
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,510
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Then I'll have no more wishes left!</font>

568
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,910
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

569
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,810
<font color="yellow">Please show them around.</font>

570
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll guide you. This way, please.</font>

571
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,830
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

572
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,840
<font color="yellow">Well, then.</font>

573
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,760
<font color="yellow">I'll get going, too.</font>

574
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,270
<font color="yellow">The mayor is here. You should stay and watch the shoot a bit, as well.</font>

575
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,140
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

576
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,570
<font color="yellow">See you soon.</font>

577
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,940
<font color="yellow">He was going on about how we can't run late.</font>

578
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,740
<font color="yellow">Why are they being so strict?</font>

579
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,810
<font color="yellow">What are all those?</font>

580
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,840
<font color="yellow">The mayor's wife told us to give these to the actors.</font>

581
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,680
<font color="yellow">Goodness. She's making you guys do such ridiculous things.</font>

582
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,340
<font color="yellow">Chief, take this.</font>

583
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,740
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
-  Just take it.</font>

584
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,390
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

585
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,190
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything to wipe it off with?</font>

586
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,640
<font color="yellow">No. Gosh.</font>

587
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,070
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

588
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh, let me do it.</font>

589
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,580
<font color="yellow">Chief!</font>

590
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,510
<font color="yellow">You're being like that again. Okay, just stand still.</font>

591
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,410
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Please stop!</font>

592
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,110
<font color="yellow">Stop it, please!</font>

593
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,840
<font color="yellow">Stop making so much fuss! Stop moving. It got on here, too.</font>

594
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,940
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

595
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,970
<font color="yellow">Stop moving, seriously.</font>

596
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,180
<font color="yellow">- It's almost done.
-  What are you doing now?</font>

597
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,600
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

598
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,610
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm okay.</font>

599
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,650
<font color="yellow">You're really okay, right?</font>

600
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,110
<font color="yellow">You should tell me if you're not. I'll help you.</font>

601
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,710
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

602
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,200
<font color="yellow">Neglect of duty, demeaning dignity...</font>

603
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,450
<font color="yellow">- and bribery.
-  What?</font>

604
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,810
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you avoid such things...</font>

605
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,440
<font color="yellow">- as a government employee?
-  And?</font>

606
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,710
<font color="yellow">You turned out to be such a rogue civil servant.</font>

607
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,000
<font color="yellow">A rogue civil servant?</font>

608
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,630
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

609
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,840
<font color="yellow">Don't bother. Gosh.</font>

610
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,390
<font color="yellow">You see, we're not civil servants.</font>

612
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,530
<font color="yellow">We need more time to shoot. We'll extend the hours.</font>

613

<font color="yellow">Under whose permission?</font>

614
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,400
<font color="yellow">What if someone gets hurt like last time? Who will be responsible?</font>

615

616
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,370
<font color="yellow">Yes, please do that.</font>

621
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,240
<font color="yellow">We already told you the hours. Make sure you follow it.</font>

622

<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

624
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,770
<font color="yellow">Cut. Okay, that's good.</font>

625
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,410
<font color="yellow">Let's move onto the next scene.</font>

626
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,600
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and take it down.</font>

627
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,900

632
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,800
<font color="yellow">- It's almost 6pm.
-  How much more do we have left?</font>

633
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,910
<font color="yellow">- Just one scene.
-  Hurry up and finish it.</font>

634
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,640
<font color="yellow">- Are they finished over there?
-  Yes.</font>

635

<font color="yellow">About that woman earlier...</font>

640
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,040

641
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,810
<font color="yellow">Maybe she finds me easy.</font>

642

644
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,770

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

649
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,120
<font color="yellow">Cut! Okay. That was great.</font>

650
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,270
<font color="yellow">- All right.
-  Great job.</font>

651
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,240
<font color="yellow">- Good job.
-  Good job.</font>

652
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,610
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

653
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,740

00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,310
<font color="yellow">If you want to settle or give her compensation money,</font>

920
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,790
<font color="yellow">you should talk with her.</font>

921
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,910
<font color="yellow">I'll drop the charges if she asks me to,</font>

922
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:27,540
<font color="yellow">but I won't do it even if you come and talk to me every day.</font>

923
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:31,810
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

924
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,870
<font color="yellow">How can I?</font>

925
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,070
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything.</font>

926
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,040
<font color="yellow">Is your name Mi Rae?</font>

927
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,970
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

928
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,930
<font color="yellow">I'm asking my seven fans.</font>

929
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,540
<font color="yellow">If you take the lawsuit any further,</font>

930
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,040
<font color="yellow">it'll only get more tiresome for you.</font>

931
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:04,240
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

932
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,870
<font color="yellow">What should I do? What would be the best?</font>

933
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:11,840
<font color="yellow">It'd be best to drop the charges for everyone's benefit.</font>

934
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,350
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's right to drop the charges now.</font>

935
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,370
<font color="yellow">Then what?</font>

936
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,030
<font color="yellow">Is it too cowardly to take what they offer?</font>

937
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,320
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do then?</font>

938
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,630
<font color="yellow">- Just fight them until the end.
-  She might die.</font>

939
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,360
<font color="yellow">- Just compromise.
-  That's cowardly.</font>

940
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,620
<font color="yellow">Take the money.</font>

941
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,230
<font color="yellow">- It's too hard.
-  Figure it out yourself.</font>

942
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,640
<font color="yellow">None of you are helpful.</font>

943
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,170
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

944
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:37,510
<font color="yellow">It was so tough for her until now.</font>

945
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,350
<font color="yellow">I know. I'm sure both of you had a rough time.</font>

946
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,970
<font color="yellow">No, I still had fun.</font>

947
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:49,070
<font color="yellow">I told her she should sue since it was identical to her work.</font>

948
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,210
<font color="yellow">Other writers might get harmed by it, as well.</font>

949
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:58,890
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'll make sure to never make the mistake again.</font>

950
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,610
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

951
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,140
<font color="yellow">That's why I need your help with this case.</font>

952
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,970
<font color="yellow">If you can make the decision...</font>

953
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,780
<font color="yellow">I don't have the power to make such a decision.</font>

954
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,970
<font color="yellow">I also...</font>

955
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,710
<font color="yellow">have a problem with making decisions.</font>

956
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,370
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

957
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:28,140
<font color="yellow">You might want to talk to my legal guardian instead of me.</font>

958
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,370
<font color="yellow">Legal...</font>

959
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,560
<font color="yellow">guardian?</font>

960
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,710
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's double, no triple times more cold than me.</font>

961
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:38,110
<font color="yellow">He has the ability to make quick decisions.</font>

962
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:41,010
<font color="yellow">You can talk to my brother and legal guardian.</font>

963
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:42,960
<font color="yellow">Your brother?</font>

964
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,340
<font color="yellow">Yes. I can't make a decision.</font>

965
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,270
<font color="yellow">I'll drop the charges if he tells me to.</font>

966
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,240
<font color="yellow">She's not even young.</font>

967
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,940
<font color="yellow">She's over 30 years old. Why do I have to talk to her brother?</font>

968
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,650
<font color="yellow">It's no time for us to be picky.</font>

969
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,260
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if it's her brother or not. We need to beg.</font>

970
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,280
<font color="yellow">Come on, Min Joo. Meet with him tomorrow.</font>

971
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,740
<font color="yellow">I'm busy tomorrow.</font>

972
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,460
<font color="yellow">Is my team doing okay?</font>

973
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,140
<font color="yellow">That's not important right now!</font>

974
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,940
<font color="yellow">You're finally showing your true self.</font>

975
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,090
<font color="yellow">Jeong Sik. Who do you think I'm doing this for?</font>

976
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,270
<font color="yellow">I know. I know that.</font>

977
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,570
<font color="yellow">That's why I was really thorough with Writer Na's script today.</font>

978
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,670
<font color="yellow">You should just focus on...</font>

979
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,150
<font color="yellow">choosing what's more important to work on.</font>

980
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:31,390
<font color="yellow">I'm already busy with what I have. Why should I focus on you?</font>

981
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:32,510
<font color="yellow">I'm hanging up.</font>

982
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,140
<font color="yellow">Did one of my lights go out?</font>

983
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,570
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo?</font>

984
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,110
<font color="yellow">Come and have breakfast.</font>

985
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,060
<font color="yellow">Why did you set for three? Mi Rae never eats breakfast.</font>

986
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,210
<font color="yellow">That's for our neighbour.</font>

987
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,310
<font color="yellow">- What? Our neighbour?
-  Yes.</font>

988
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,170
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

989
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,210
<font color="yellow">- Good morning.
-  Come on in.</font>

990
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,540
<font color="yellow">It smells delicious...</font>

991
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,940
<font color="yellow">- Why is she...
-  Why are you...</font>

992
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,840
<font color="yellow">What's this? Do you know each other?</font>

993
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:46,570
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

994
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,040
<font color="yellow">Why is he here?</font>

995
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,270
<font color="yellow">Because it's my house!</font>

996
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,040
<font color="yellow">This is your place?</font>

997
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:59,540
<font color="yellow">You better move out right now.</font>

998
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,260
<font color="yellow">Yes. I want to get out of here this instant.</font>

999
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,660
<font color="yellow">What's with you guys?</font>

1000
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,500
<font color="yellow">I paid to come in here. Why are you bossing me around?</font>

1001
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,410
<font color="yellow">I'm the landlord!</font>

1002
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,270
<font color="yellow">Who did I sign with then?</font>

1003
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,080
<font color="yellow">I'm so hungry.</font>

1004
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,460
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, do you have food?</font>

1005
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,930
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo, pack up some side dishes for me.</font>

1006
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:19,220
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  How do you like your place?</font>

1007
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,440
<font color="yellow">How can you let just anyone move in here?</font>

1008
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,510
<font color="yellow">"Just anyone"?</font>

1009
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,150
<font color="yellow">Watch it!</font>

1010
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,220
<font color="yellow">What happened? Why are they fighting?</font>

1011
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,760
<font color="yellow">Why were you sawing at midnight?</font>

1012
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,540
<font color="yellow">How can you barge in here so early in the morning?</font>

1013
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:33,010
<font color="yellow">She has no common sense nor any manners. She's just selfish!</font>

1014
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,010
<font color="yellow">Brother!</font>

1015
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,210
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1016
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,240
<font color="yellow">He's your brother? Really?</font>

1017
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,870
<font color="yellow">No, we're not real brothers.</font>

1018
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,870
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened,</font>

1019
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,000
<font color="yellow">but let's just sort it out.</font>

1020
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,250
<font color="yellow">- No way!
-  Forget it!</font>

1021
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,520
<font color="yellow">Move out right now!</font>

1022
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,690
<font color="yellow">Fine, I will.</font>

1023
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:52,760
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

1024
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,570
<font color="yellow">You're so loud, what's going on? I can't sleep!</font>

1025
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:57,810
<font color="yellow">Ms Ko Mi Rae?</font>

1026
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:03,010
<font color="yellow">I'm sleepy.</font>

1027
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:04,810
<font color="yellow">Hey...</font>

1028
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,670
<font color="yellow">How do you know my sister?</font>

1029
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,570
<font color="yellow">Your sister?</font>

1030
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,670
<font color="yellow">He's double, no triple times more cold than me.</font>

1031
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,110
<font color="yellow">He has the ability to make quick decisions.</font>

1032
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,740
<font color="yellow">You can talk to my brother and legal guardian.</font>

1033
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,240
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

1034
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,860
<font color="yellow">Are you Mi Rae's big brother?</font>

1035
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,050
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1036
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,370
<font color="yellow">I'm her big brother. Why?</font>

1037
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:50,410
<font color="yellow">(Second to Last Love)</font>

1038
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,100
<font color="yellow">Try some of this.</font>

1039
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,830
<font color="yellow">- It'll tighten it.
-  What?</font>

1040
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,970
<font color="yellow">Why did you eat this?</font>

1041
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:57,330
<font color="yellow">Because she gave it to me! She told me it would tighten...</font>

1042
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,700
<font color="yellow">You should keep a distance from her.</font>

1043
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,910
<font color="yellow">- I think she's nice.
-  What are you saying?</font>

1044
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:04,300
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything dangerous.</font>

1045
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,760
<font color="yellow">Also, don't even think about coming up here alone.</font>

1046
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,320
<font color="yellow">Are you worrying about me?</font>

1047
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,370
<font color="yellow">Are you single?</font>

1048
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,220
<font color="yellow">You should ask a man to do something like that.</font>

1049
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,010
<font color="yellow">No wonder you're single.</font>
