00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,540
<font color="yellow">Sometimes if you keep living,</font>

159
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,800
<font color="yellow">you might even meet someone else.</font>

160
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,540
<font color="yellow">The dead is the one at loss,</font>

161
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,540
<font color="yellow">so don't be like this. Don't joke around with life.</font>

162
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,440
<font color="yellow">It's just too foolish.</font>

163
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,800
<font color="yellow">I want to be remembered even if that's what it takes.</font>

164
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,840
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't know unless you've lost someone before.</font>

165
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,670
<font color="yellow">Don't look at the clock.</font>

166
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,640
<font color="yellow">Let's only live in the moment.</font>

167
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,170
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

168
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,030
<font color="yellow">(Resume)</font>

169
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,200
<font color="yellow">I saw that you used to be a drama producer before.</font>

170
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,040
<font color="yellow">I think you'd be the best fit for Woori City's drama project.</font>

171
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,640
<font color="yellow">All I did was assist for a few years at the studio.</font>

172
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,440
<font color="yellow">In any case, your degree and experiences...</font>

173
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,370
<font color="yellow">are in the same field.</font>

174
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,110
<font color="yellow">Can you please participate in the screening evaluation?</font>

175
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,770
<font color="yellow">I believe someone like yourself will be very fair.</font>

176
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,800
<font color="yellow">Ever since then,</font>

177
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,200
<font color="yellow">I tried so hard to get away from the industry.</font>

178
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,200
<font color="yellow">This is very similar to mine.</font>

179
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,900
<font color="yellow">As if there is an invisible tie,</font>

180
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,640
<font color="yellow">have I been pushed to a dead end where I can't avoid it any longer?</font>

181
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,470
<font color="yellow">Our female lead will likely be Na Joo Yeon.</font>

182
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,570
<font color="yellow">We found a good story from a new writer.</font>

183
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,440
<font color="yellow">We'll hire a star writer to write the script.</font>

184
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,230
<font color="yellow">I'll direct.</font>

185
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,900
<font color="yellow">Great. What about you, Producer Kang?</font>

186
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,430
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

187
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,570
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

188
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,470
<font color="yellow">A writer who hasn't debuted?</font>

189
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,170
<font color="yellow">She's a nameless web comic artist?</font>

190
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,240
<font color="yellow">Nam Ki Cheol is directing?</font>

191
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,740
<font color="yellow">How is this going to work?</font>

192
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,790
<font color="yellow">We plan on going to the city hall to interview them first.</font>

193
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,710
<font color="yellow">If you don't make this, your department will be split.</font>

194
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,660
<font color="yellow">I'll either send you to the suburbs, or to different departments.</font>

195
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,660
<font color="yellow">You're trying to push us down even more? That won't happen.</font>

196
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,470
<font color="yellow">I hope so, too.</font>

197
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
<font color="yellow">You don't have a chance with that shabby of a group.</font>

198
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,300
<font color="yellow">We might be shabby or we might be "The Avengers". You'll see.</font>

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,750
<font color="yellow">I should go visit Woori City, too. Maybe I'll visit your new house.</font>

200
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,770
<font color="yellow">Can I go?</font>

201
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,880
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

202
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,860
<font color="yellow">Don't visit her place.</font>

203
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,860
<font color="yellow">Why not? Of course I should, we're close.</font>

204
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,400
<font color="yellow">Don't think you can act that way just because you're married.</font>

205
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,370
<font color="yellow">She has a boyfriend.</font>

206
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,470
<font color="yellow">A boyfriend? Who?</font>

207
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,000
<font color="yellow">Her next door neighbour.</font>

208
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,770
<font color="yellow">What? Her next door neighbour?</font>

209
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,000
<font color="yellow">Do you really not have any feelings for me?</font>

210
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,740
<font color="yellow">Nothing at all?</font>

211
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,840
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  They why were you so nice to me...</font>

212
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,870
<font color="yellow">in Canada?</font>

213
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,970
<font color="yellow">- That's...
-  Why?</font>

214
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,700
<font color="yellow">Did you feel sorry for me?</font>

215
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,720
<font color="yellow">Because my parents were fighting all the time...</font>

216
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,200
<font color="yellow">and I was left alone?</font>

217
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,170
<font color="yellow">Because you...</font>

218
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,870
<font color="yellow">were like me.</font>

219
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,070
<font color="yellow">You were like a child left alone in the playground.</font>

220
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,470
<font color="yellow">I saw my childhood in you.</font>

221
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo.</font>

222
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,300
<font color="yellow">On top of that,</font>

223
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,540
<font color="yellow">I was thankful that you ate and liked everything I cooked.</font>

224
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,270
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

225
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,200
<font color="yellow">I wasn't nice to you because I felt bad for you.</font>

226
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,470
<font color="yellow">I did it for myself.</font>

227
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,800
<font color="yellow">It wasn't out of sympathy.</font>

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,300
<font color="yellow">It was only to comfort myself.</font>

229
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,100
<font color="yellow">I'm selfish, right?</font>

230
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,540
<font color="yellow">That's fine.</font>

231
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,340
<font color="yellow">Us lonely people can live together.</font>

232
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,440
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

233
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,300
<font color="yellow">It hurts me more to see you.</font>

234
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,000
<font color="yellow">You obsess over men saying it's love, and you depend on them.</font>

235
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,100
<font color="yellow">It scares me because I feel like I'm seeing my mum.</font>

236
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo.</font>

237
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,270
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

238
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,770
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll find your own life and move on.</font>

239
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,470
<font color="yellow">I mean it.</font>

240
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,200
<font color="yellow">Then are you considering marriage with Jun Woo?</font>

241
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
<font color="yellow">Marriage? I never even thought that far.</font>

242
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,700
<font color="yellow">Then that's how much you like him.</font>

243
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,670
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I'm not sure yet.</font>

244
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,930
<font color="yellow">I don't know how much I like him.</font>

245
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,940
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure...</font>

246
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,890
<font color="yellow">if I like him at all.</font>

247
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,780
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

248
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,110
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

249
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,940
<font color="yellow">if you want to find out if you like him or not,</font>

250
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,470
<font color="yellow">imagine being in bed with him.</font>

251
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,010
<font color="yellow">If you can't picture being with him, then he's out.</font>

252
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,440
<font color="yellow">If you can, then you're good.</font>

253
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,470
<font color="yellow">Well?</font>

254
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,200
<font color="yellow">Can you imagine being with Jun Woo in bed?</font>

255
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,270
<font color="yellow">I don't know. People will talk bad about me.</font>

256
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,460
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're committing adultery.</font>

257
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,670
<font color="yellow">People will talk bad about me if they knew.</font>

258
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,460
<font color="yellow">Hey. Men date girls that are 20 years...</font>

259
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,250
<font color="yellow">younger than them, and they even get married.</font>

260
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,970
<font color="yellow">What's wrong if it's the other way around?</font>

261
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
<font color="yellow">You're biased.</font>

262
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,320
<font color="yellow">It's a lot of pressure, though.</font>

263
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,600
<font color="yellow">I'm not a fan of Jun Woo.</font>

264
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,690
<font color="yellow">Of course there's the age difference,</font>

265
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,270
<font color="yellow">but it worries me that his ex-girlfriend is around.</font>

266
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,460
<font color="yellow">Everyone has a past.</font>

267
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,950
<font color="yellow">You can just clean that up.</font>

268
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,520
<font color="yellow">I'd love a younger man.</font>

269
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,970
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with everyone except for younger men.</font>

270
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,410
<font color="yellow">How can I keep up with a young guy?</font>

271
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,420
<font color="yellow">Just thinking about it makes me tired.</font>

272
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,570
<font color="yellow">She's shaking.</font>

273
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,290
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we'd break up when I get old.</font>

274
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,570
<font color="yellow">What's the point?</font>

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,770
<font color="yellow">It'd feel like walking on manholes with killer heels every day.</font>

276
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,550
<font color="yellow">Actually, I'm not that confident, either.</font>

277
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,570
<font color="yellow">That's why you should meet someone you're comfortable with.</font>

278
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,340
<font color="yellow">Someone you can talk to like a friend.</font>

279
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,350
<font color="yellow">Someone you can lean on time to time.</font>

280
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,840
<font color="yellow">Where on earth are they?</font>

281
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,540
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

282
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,570
<font color="yellow">A woman should always...</font>

283
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,870
<font color="yellow">have their heart flutter in order to feel alive.</font>

284
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree?</font>

285
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,310
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Let's do a toast.</font>

286
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,600
<font color="yellow">If you don't want him, let me have him.</font>

287
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

288
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,440
<font color="yellow">There are no hand-me-downs in love.</font>

289
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,570
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

290
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,200
<font color="yellow">You'll give her up for Jun Woo?</font>

291
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,640
<font color="yellow">Give her up?</font>

292
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,090
<font color="yellow">She lost someone she loved in her past.</font>

293
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she went through a lot.</font>

294
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,740
<font color="yellow">I know how that feels.</font>

295
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,540
<font color="yellow">Of course you do.</font>

296
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,640
<font color="yellow">Now that she met Jun Woo,</font>

297
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,040
<font color="yellow">I hope things work out for her. I mean it.</font>

298
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,440
<font color="yellow">Did you commit a crime or what?</font>

299
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,970
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

300
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,300
<font color="yellow">I think I did.</font>

301
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,410
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

302
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,040
<font color="yellow">if this ominous feeling turns out to be true,</font>

303
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,670
<font color="yellow">it'll be really hard for me to deal with.</font>

304
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,070
<font color="yellow">I'd feel so sorry to her.</font>

305
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,370
<font color="yellow">There's something going on, isn't there?</font>

306
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
<font color="yellow">In any case,</font>

307
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,940
<font color="yellow">she just started a new life with Jun Woo.</font>

308
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,240
<font color="yellow">It must have been a hard decision.</font>

309
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,770
<font color="yellow">I don't want to ruin it for her.</font>

310
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,410
<font color="yellow">Do you know what kind of person is the most annoying?</font>

311
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,390
<font color="yellow">People who act like they're something they're not.</font>

312
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,770
<font color="yellow">They act caring and more mature. But it's all an act.</font>

313
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,310
<font color="yellow">That's the most annoying kind.</font>

314
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,580
<font color="yellow">Your spitting on me.</font>

315
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,040
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

316
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
<font color="yellow">Excuse me,</font>

317
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,740
<font color="yellow">do you have this in a single packet instead of this 1 plus 1 deal?</font>

318
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,070
<font color="yellow">They all come in sets. I don't have any single packets.</font>

319
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,140
<font color="yellow">It's too much for one person.</font>

320
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,430
<font color="yellow">You just moved in, right?</font>

321
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,350
<font color="yellow">You live at Chief Ko's place.</font>

322
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,770
<font color="yellow">Yes. There are a lot of single-person families these days.</font>

323
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,450
<font color="yellow">I don't know why they would make this so big.</font>

324
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,620
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to take it out?</font>

325
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,300
<font color="yellow">No, I'll just take it.</font>

326
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

327
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,410
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

328
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,970
<font color="yellow">Honey, why were you outside?</font>

329
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,020
<font color="yellow">- Who... Who is that?
-  Hurry.</font>

330
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,320
<font color="yellow">Did he stalk you?</font>

331
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,240
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside. Let's hurry to my door.</font>

332
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,740
<font color="yellow">We suddenly got a slew of visitors.</font>

333
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,070
<font color="yellow">Our town isn't usually like this.</font>

334
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,440
<font color="yellow">You must be really surprised. Look at that cold sweat.</font>

335
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,770
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

336
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,640
<font color="yellow">Why are you wearing such a short skirt?</font>

337
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,800
<font color="yellow">You must be going somewhere.</font>

338
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,270
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

339
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,070
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  Sang Sik.</font>

340
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,670
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

341
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,070
<font color="yellow">- Min Joo.
-  Jun Woo.</font>

342
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,000
<font color="yellow">There was a strange man stalking her.</font>

343
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
<font color="yellow">A strange man?</font>

344
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,640
<font color="yellow">No, don't worry.</font>

345
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,700
<font color="yellow">It's fine now.</font>

346
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,340
<font color="yellow">- I better go in. Thank you.
-  No problem.</font>

347
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,670
<font color="yellow">I was just on my way to pick up something.</font>

348
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,870
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

349
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,400
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

350
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,670
<font color="yellow">- Min Joo.
-  My goodness!</font>

351
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,070
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

352
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,370
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to surprise you.</font>

353
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,020
<font color="yellow">You came in so suddenly. My heart dropped.</font>

354
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,130
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

355
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,600
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to knock or ring the bell next time.</font>

356
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,740
<font color="yellow">Did you go get groceries?</font>

357
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

358
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,470
<font color="yellow">I was seeing my friends out...</font>

359
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,950
<font color="yellow">and went to grab some groceries.</font>

360
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,250
<font color="yellow">Don't go out by yourself late at night.</font>

361
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,100
<font color="yellow">You should go with me when you get groceries.</font>

362
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,740
<font color="yellow">Are they still together?</font>

363
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,440
<font color="yellow">Just leave it. I can put it up by myself.</font>

364
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,970
<font color="yellow">I'm almost done.</font>

365
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

366
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,370
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

367
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,740
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

368
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,540
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm fine.</font>

369
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,770
<font color="yellow">- Did you touch something?
-  No, I just...</font>

370
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,580
<font color="yellow">I just plugged in the pot to make you coffee.</font>

371
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,740
<font color="yellow">The fuse must be out.</font>

372
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,270
<font color="yellow">The fuse is out.</font>

373
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,050
<font color="yellow">What should I do? It's too late.</font>

374
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,370
<font color="yellow">You'll have to fix it tomorrow.</font>

375
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

376
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,540
<font color="yellow">Are you scared because it's dark?</font>

377
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,840
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

378
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,330
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

379
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,050
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

380
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,070
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

381
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,470
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

382
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
<font color="yellow">It can't be.</font>

383
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,970
<font color="yellow">I can stay by myself. I'm not scared.</font>

384
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,770
<font color="yellow">Didn't a strange guy follow you earlier?</font>

385
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,970
<font color="yellow">You must be anxious since you don't have electricity.</font>

386
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,570
<font color="yellow">I'll leave as soon as I see you fall asleep.</font>

387
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,440
<font color="yellow">How can I sleep when someone is around?</font>

388
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,460
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm a stranger. Why can't you sleep?</font>

389
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,200
<font color="yellow">I'd be too uncomfortable to sleep.</font>

390
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,700
<font color="yellow">Are you uncomfortable with me?</font>

391
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,940
<font color="yellow">No, the thing is...</font>

392
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,700
<font color="yellow">You must be having weird thoughts.</font>

393
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,270
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

394
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,740
<font color="yellow">Just lie down. You must be tired.</font>

395
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,200
<font color="yellow">You must be tired, too. You should go home.</font>

396
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,470
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

397
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,890
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sleep over.</font>

398
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,970
<font color="yellow">Stop joking around and leave.</font>

399
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,740
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll go in a bit.</font>

400
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,540
<font color="yellow">- My gosh.
-  You're so awkward.</font>

401
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,100
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

402
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,900
<font color="yellow">What do you like about an old lady like me?</font>

403
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,270
<font color="yellow">What do you like about living alone like this?</font>

404
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,840
<font color="yellow">I didn't...</font>

405
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,040
<font color="yellow">particularly want to be single.</font>

406
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,380
<font color="yellow">It just somehow turned out that way.</font>

407
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,940
<font color="yellow">After a while, I just got used to it.</font>

408
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,570
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

409
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,940
<font color="yellow">it's harder for me to imagine living with someone else.</font>

410
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,170
<font color="yellow">Do you plan on living alone forever?</font>

411
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

412
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,800
<font color="yellow">The older I get,</font>

413
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,700
<font color="yellow">being alone makes me nervous.</font>

414
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,370
<font color="yellow">However, I can't make that an excuse to get married.</font>

415
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,870
<font color="yellow">This is why I like you.</font>

416
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

417
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,170
<font color="yellow">Most people are scared of being alone and lonely.</font>

418
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,100
<font color="yellow">So they can't even break up with people they don't love any more.</font>

419
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,600
<font color="yellow">Most people are scared of being alone, as well.</font>

420
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,340
<font color="yellow">But you're different.</font>

421
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,740
<font color="yellow">Who are you referring to? Ji Sun?</font>

422
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,720
<font color="yellow">Well, she's one of them.</font>

423
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,740
<font color="yellow">Is there someone else?</font>

424
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,570
<font color="yellow">My mum.</font>

425
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,440
<font color="yellow">My parents got divorced when I was a kid,</font>

426
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,140
<font color="yellow">but she could neither move on...</font>

427
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,040
<font color="yellow">nor be alone.</font>

428
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,970
<font color="yellow">I felt bad for her, but I also thought,</font>

429
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,340
<font color="yellow">"Why is she like that when she's an adult?"</font>

430
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,700
<font color="yellow">I couldn't really understand her back then.</font>

431
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,470
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

432
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,400
<font color="yellow">that case is a little different.</font>

433
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,940
<font color="yellow">It's not different at all.</font>

434
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,400
<font color="yellow">She ended up meeting someone else...</font>

435
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,100
<font color="yellow">and is fine now.</font>

436
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,670
<font color="yellow">Is she in Canada now?</font>

437
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

438
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,170
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

439
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,920
<font color="yellow">I wasted your time by telling you useless things.</font>

440
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,120
<font color="yellow">I should go now.</font>

441
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,810
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

442
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,740
<font color="yellow">Just stay there. You don't need to walk me out.</font>

443
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,600
<font color="yellow">It'll wake you up.</font>

444
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,470
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good night.</font>

445
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,140
<font color="yellow">I'll fix the fuse tomorrow.</font>

446
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,440
<font color="yellow">When will I get another chance like this?</font>

447
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,570
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

448
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams.</font>

449
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,900
<font color="yellow">Good morning!</font>

450
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,570
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

451
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,370
<font color="yellow">- Did you come alone?
-  Yes.</font>

452
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,540
<font color="yellow">- Where's Jun Woo?
-  He went to pick up ingredients.</font>

453
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,770
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

454
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,150
<font color="yellow">Did you come here for a walk?</font>

455
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, sort of.</font>

456
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,670
<font color="yellow">If you want to exercise in the morning, let's do it together.</font>

457
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,470
<font color="yellow">Why would I do that?</font>

458
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,370
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

459
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,570
<font color="yellow">What I mean is that...</font>

460
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,580
<font color="yellow">I don't want to interrupt you two having a lovely time.</font>

461
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,570
<font color="yellow">What's there to interrupt? We'll just be exercising together.</font>

462
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,600
<font color="yellow">Are Young Hee and Cheol Soo doing well by the way?</font>

463
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,440
<font color="yellow">They're still glued to each other. It's so lovely.</font>

464
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,640
<font color="yellow">I know, right? Being together must be better than being alone.</font>

465
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,570
<font color="yellow">What about you? Are you going to live alone forever?</font>

466
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,440
<font color="yellow">Well... I have my family, you know?</font>

467
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,270
<font color="yellow">What about after everyone leaves?</font>

468
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,300
<font color="yellow">I mean, both Mi Rae and Ye Ji will get married eventually.</font>

469
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,300
<font color="yellow">Then I'll get to live alone and enjoy my freedom.</font>

470
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that the thought of living alone...</font>

471
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,340
<font color="yellow">scares you from time to time. Am I wrong?</font>

472
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,200
<font color="yellow">Well, I can't really deny that.</font>

473
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,970
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to you about Jun Woo.</font>

474
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,370
<font color="yellow">He's a great guy.</font>

475
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,940
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of him.</font>

476
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,070
<font color="yellow">We grew up together since we were very young,</font>

477
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,070
<font color="yellow">so he's like a brother to me.</font>

478
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,310
<font color="yellow">There isn't really anything I can do.</font>

479
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,640
<font color="yellow">Dating someone at this age feels awkward,</font>

480
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,370
<font color="yellow">and it's definitely not easy.</font>

481
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,770
<font color="yellow">But why are you telling me this all of a sudden?</font>

482
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,970
<font color="yellow">It's because...</font>

483
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,100
<font color="yellow">we're friends.</font>

484
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,640
<font color="yellow">- Right, we're friends.
-  Yes.</font>

485
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're friends.</font>

486
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,940
<font color="yellow">Attention, everyone.</font>

487
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,670
<font color="yellow">We must get the drama for Woori City.</font>

488
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,850
<font color="yellow">I know that all of you have your own goals,</font>

489
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,300
<font color="yellow">but a rough road will be ahead of us if we don't get this project.</font>

490
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,370
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what will happen to us.</font>

491
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,020
<font color="yellow">So please stay focused,</font>

492
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,520
<font color="yellow">and let's do our best. Got it?</font>

493
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,640
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
-  Yes, got it!</font>

494
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

495
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,040
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. This room is great.</font>

496
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,540
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae, which room are you going to use?</font>

497
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,870
<font color="yellow">Which room? I'm not sure.</font>

498
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,650
<font color="yellow">I'm going to use this room, so you should find another one.</font>

499
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,030
<font color="yellow">There aren't that many rooms. Shouldn't we be sharing rooms?</font>

500
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,120
<font color="yellow">I can't share my bed with anyone.</font>

501
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,420
<font color="yellow">I'm very sensitive.</font>

502
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,440
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

503
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,470
<font color="yellow">Wow, this room is awesome.</font>

504
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,640
<font color="yellow">Writer Na. You two will be sharing this room, right?</font>

505
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:26,370
<font color="yellow">There's a couch in the living room. I can sleep anywhere.</font>

506
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:29,370
<font color="yellow">That's not right. You two should exchange opinions and...</font>

507
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,540
<font color="yellow">We can do that during meetings.</font>

508
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,940
<font color="yellow">You should still share the room and spend time...</font>

509
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,670
<font color="yellow">I'm not sensitive, so I can sleep anywhere.</font>

510
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so sick of this tension.</font>

511
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,690
<font color="yellow">- We should do it properly.
-  Absolutely.</font>

512
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,770
<font color="yellow">Hey, Chief Ko!</font>

513
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,170
<font color="yellow">Please prepare thoroughly for the drama for Woori City.</font>

514
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,470
<font color="yellow">I was just at the provincial office because of that project.</font>

515
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,300
<font color="yellow">- The provincial office?
-  I wanted to review our budget.</font>

516
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,270
<font color="yellow">I see. Oh, right.</font>

517
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:14,300
<font color="yellow">I want your department to take care of this as soon as possible.</font>

518
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,880
<font color="yellow">- What is this?
-  You know the cruise ship docked...</font>

519
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,900
<font color="yellow">at the shore of Woori Forest Town, right?</font>

520
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,300
<font color="yellow">Yes. The city has neglected it for a while,</font>

521
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,670
<font color="yellow">so it's become useless.</font>

522
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,820
<font color="yellow">You should restore it...</font>

523
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,240
<font color="yellow">and use it to attract more tourists.</font>

524
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,470
<font color="yellow">The business support department...</font>

525
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,660
<font color="yellow">pushed for an unreasonable amount of increase in the budget to...</font>

526
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,320
<font color="yellow">You should follow your superior's order and take on the task.</font>

527
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,040
<font color="yellow">You're obviously not being a good example to your subordinates.</font>

528
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,270
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

529
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
<font color="yellow">You too, Sir.</font>

530
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,270
<font color="yellow">Chief, this is like a bomb that every department has been avoiding.</font>

531
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
<font color="yellow">The entire sum of money that has gone into this project is...</font>

532
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,870
<font color="yellow">We'll be blamed for everything if we take this on.</font>

533
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,210
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

534
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,240
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

535
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,570
<font color="yellow">This is so frustrating.</font>

536
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,570
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Goodness.</font>

537
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,870
<font color="yellow">He should be here by now.</font>

538
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,900
<font color="yellow">Who's coming?</font>

539
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,700
<font color="yellow">He's here.</font>

540
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,570
<font color="yellow">Welcome!</font>

541
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,870
<font color="yellow">Hello, everyone. I'm here to deliver your food.</font>

542
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,170
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

543
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,810
<font color="yellow">I ordered lunch for everyone.</font>

544
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,570
<font color="yellow">You're that guy. You're Producer Kang's boyfriend.</font>

545
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,530
<font color="yellow">These days, girls love guys like you who are great cooks.</font>

546
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,640
<font color="yellow">- No, no. I hope you enjoy it.
-  Thank you.</font>

547
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,180
<font color="yellow">I know you're busy. You didn't have to do this.</font>

548
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm sure he did this because he wanted to see you.</font>

549
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,540
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

550
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

551
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,340
<font color="yellow">You're young and good-looking. What do you like about Producer Kang?</font>

552
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,740
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

553
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,570
<font color="yellow">She's so inspiring and beautiful.</font>

554
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,470
<font color="yellow">She's much more attractive than young girls who talk thoughtlessly.</font>

555
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,860
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

556
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,070
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Let's eat, everyone. Here.</font>

557
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,600
<font color="yellow">It looks so delicious. Thanks!</font>

558
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,710
<font color="yellow">Were you surprised to see me show up like that?</font>

559
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,440
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine. Thanks so much for doing that.</font>

560
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,270
<font color="yellow">Do you really mean it?</font>

561
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,700
<font color="yellow">I actually feel a bit uncomfortable when you visit me at work.</font>

562
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,700
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

563
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,570
<font color="yellow">Call me next time to give me a heads up.</font>

564
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,340
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

565
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,240
<font color="yellow">I won't show up randomly any more.</font>

566
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,600
<font color="yellow">I'll call you and ask you first.</font>

567
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,140
<font color="yellow">Is Ji Sun watching the cafe right now?</font>

568
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,640
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask? Does it bother you?</font>

569
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,140
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

570
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,570
<font color="yellow">She's saying all those things,</font>

571
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,770
<font color="yellow">but I'm sure she's heartbroken inside.</font>

572
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,200
<font color="yellow">I see. So you're not bothered by her,</font>

573
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,470
<font color="yellow">but you're worried about her.</font>

574
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,040
<font color="yellow">Breaking up with you...</font>

575
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
<font color="yellow">must feel like being cut off from the entire world.</font>

576
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,570
<font color="yellow">She must feel as though everything is over for her.</font>

577
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,700
<font color="yellow">How can you understand her so well?</font>

578
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,540
<font color="yellow">Because I used to be like that.</font>

579
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,700
<font color="yellow">With your first love?</font>

580
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,270
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

581
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,070
<font color="yellow">Back then, love was my everything.</font>

582
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,200
<font color="yellow">We had decided on a date for our wedding...</font>

583
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,270
<font color="yellow">and even sent out wedding invitations.</font>

584
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,810
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

585
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,870
<font color="yellow">Then what happened?</font>

586
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,600
<font color="yellow">There was an accident.</font>

587
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,470
<font color="yellow">I ran to the hospital in shock,</font>

588
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,140
<font color="yellow">but he was already...</font>

589
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
<font color="yellow">It must've been so hard for you.</font>

590
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,170
<font color="yellow">You said that Ji Sun also lost her parents...</font>

591
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,900
<font color="yellow">due to an accident, right?</font>

592
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,570
<font color="yellow">You've been her support system, but you left her, as well.</font>

593
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
<font color="yellow">Her coming all the way here and not wanting to let you go...</font>

594
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,670
<font color="yellow">is only natural. I understand it.</font>

595
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,820
<font color="yellow">However, being good to her now...</font>

596
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,840
<font color="yellow">might make things worse for her.</font>

597
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,210
<font color="yellow">Anyway, don't worry about her too much.</font>

598
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,280
<font color="yellow">She probably just needs a little bit of time...</font>

599
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,970
<font color="yellow">to find a way to become a real adult on her own.</font>

600
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,450
<font color="yellow">It's in a pretty good shape.</font>

601
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,310
<font color="yellow">Why did it stop operating?</font>

602
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,980
<font color="yellow">Operating it is costly,</font>

603
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,370
<font color="yellow">and there isn't anything special about its routes.</font>

604
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,100
<font color="yellow">You brought your camera, right?</font>

605
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,660
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

606
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,840
<font color="yellow">- Take photos of the front.
-  Okay.</font>

607
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,640
<font color="yellow">- Take photos of over there, too.
-  I will.</font>

608
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,670
<font color="yellow">He's so cool.</font>

609
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,870
<font color="yellow">What a handsome guy.</font>

610
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,130
<font color="yellow">You're not taking photos of me now, are you?</font>

611
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,350
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

612
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,770
<font color="yellow">Then are you taking photos of an airplane or what?</font>

613
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,100
<font color="yellow">Look over there.</font>

614
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,100
<font color="yellow">I think it's Chief Ko.</font>

615
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

616
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,370
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik!</font>

617
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,810
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
-  I guess you're here for work.</font>

618
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,340
<font color="yellow">Yes. What brings you here?</font>

619
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,080
<font color="yellow">We came here to have a meeting.</font>

620
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,740
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae said that it's quiet here.</font>

621
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,320
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo delivered lunch for us, too.</font>

622
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, did he?</font>

623
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,770
<font color="yellow">You're working on the drama for Woori City, right?</font>

624
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,160
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

625
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,230
<font color="yellow">I saw the video clip of you on the internet.</font>

626
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,360
<font color="yellow">- You're a celebrity now.
-  I saw it, too.</font>

627
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,170
<font color="yellow">You were so cute and funny in it.</font>

628
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,620
<font color="yellow">- Hello!
-  Yes, hello.</font>

629
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,230
<font color="yellow">Hi, Song Yi. I haven't seen you in a while.</font>

630
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,340
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

631
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
<font color="yellow">Are you here to see Chief Ko?</font>

632
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,350
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

633
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,990
<font color="yellow">I'm here for work, too. I just bumped into him.</font>

634
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,310
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

635
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,240
<font color="yellow">Then do you mind taking a photo of the two of us?</font>

636
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,550
<font color="yellow">A photo of us? What are you talking about?</font>

637
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,450
<font color="yellow">It's so beautiful here.</font>

638
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,100
<font color="yellow">When will I get to take a photo with you at a place like this?</font>

639
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,700
<font color="yellow">- But...
-  You're a celebrity, you know?</font>

640
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,070
<font color="yellow">Please just take one good photo of us.</font>

641
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,330
<font color="yellow">Give me your camera. I'll do it.</font>

642
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,370
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

643
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,310
<font color="yellow">Please take a good photo of us.</font>

644
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,870
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

645
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,840
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to take a photo all of a sudden?</font>

646
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,600
<font color="yellow">Please stand closer.</font>

647
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,440
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, seriously.
-  Just stay still.</font>

648
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,190
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time, so please hurry.</font>

649
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,380
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

650
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,270
<font color="yellow">All right. In 1, 2 and 3.</font>

651
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

652
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,340
<font color="yellow">Don't Chief Ko and I look good together?</font>

653
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,540
<font color="yellow">Yes, you do.</font>

654
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,140
<font color="yellow">See? People can sense the chemistry between us.</font>

655
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,570
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

656
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,240
<font color="yellow">Chemistry.</font>

657
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,360
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, we'll get going. Have a great day, Song Yi.</font>

658
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,470
<font color="yellow">Have a wonderful day.</font>

659
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,340
<font color="yellow">- See you later.
-  See you. Have a good day.</font>

660
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,100
<font color="yellow">What is the matter with you?</font>

661
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,630
<font color="yellow">I wanted to take revenge against her.</font>

662
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,670
<font color="yellow">Revenge?</font>

663
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,070
<font color="yellow">You said that you two are just neighbours,</font>

664
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,670
<font color="yellow">but I felt it.</font>

665
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,070
<font color="yellow">I felt that strange air...</font>

666
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,940
<font color="yellow">between the two of you.</font>

667
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,310
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

668
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,540
<font color="yellow">It was my intuitive hunch as a woman.</font>

669
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,740
<font color="yellow">It felt awkward, but it seemed like a chemistry at the same time.</font>

670
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,340
<font color="yellow">So I put on a show intentionally.</font>

671
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,540
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

672
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,700
<font color="yellow">Wait up.</font>

673
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,900
<font color="yellow">He really fixed it.</font>

674
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,920
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Jun Woo.
-  Hi.</font>

675
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,150
<font color="yellow">Did you get home from work?</font>

676
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, I just got in.</font>

677
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,940
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

678
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,470
<font color="yellow">My place is no longer dark thanks to you.</font>

679
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,110
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

680
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,810
<font color="yellow">I hope you didn't forget about the class today.</font>

681
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,170
<font color="yellow">It'll start shortly. Come and meet me here.</font>

682
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,340
<font color="yellow">- Now?
-  Yes. Why?</font>

683
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,940
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I'll be there soon.</font>

684
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,000
<font color="yellow">- It's delicious.
-  Isn't it so tasty?</font>

685
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,820
<font color="yellow">By the way, isn't Mr Park so attractive?</font>

686
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,770
<font color="yellow">I'm so curious to find out what kind of woman he'll end up marrying.</font>

687
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,230
<font color="yellow">He's totally my type.</font>

688
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,400
<font color="yellow">We're still single, so we can be hopeful.</font>

689
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he has a girlfriend.</font>

690
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,920
<font color="yellow">Someone who is very cute and pretty.</font>

691
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,000
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

692
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,640
<font color="yellow">Yes, definitely.</font>

693
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,020
<font color="yellow">All right, everyone. Thank you for all of your hard work today.</font>

694
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,370
<font color="yellow">We didn't do much. Thank you for all of your had work.</font>

695
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,840
<font color="yellow">Mr Park. You have a girlfriend, right?</font>

696
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,540
<font color="yellow">Girlfriend? She is my...</font>

697
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,890
<font color="yellow">- No, it's not me.
-  Goodness.</font>

698
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,970
<font color="yellow">Mr Park, stop kidding us.</font>

699
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,660
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

700
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,700
<font color="yellow">You even have a great sense of humour,</font>

701
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,840
<font color="yellow">and you also care about us so much.</font>

702
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,600
<font color="yellow">It's hot in here. I'll be right back.</font>

703
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,570
<font color="yellow">Can I not tell people about us?</font>

704
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,820
<font color="yellow">What will they think?</font>

705
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,440
<font color="yellow">Who cares about what they think? We like each other, so all is good.</font>

706
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,070
<font color="yellow">I can't even tell them that you're my girlfriend?</font>

707
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,540
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

708
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,670
<font color="yellow">Frankly, I like hearing all this from you,</font>

709
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,190
<font color="yellow">and it makes me feel better, but...</font>

710
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,190
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying it to make you feel better.</font>

711
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,470
<font color="yellow">I'm very serious right now.</font>

712
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,970
<font color="yellow">Your judgement might be...</font>

713
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,240
<font color="yellow">clouded by your emotions right now,</font>

714
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,100
<font color="yellow">making you think that I'm better than who I actually am.</font>

715
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,370
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

716
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,670
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

717
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,640
<font color="yellow">I'm nothing special.</font>

718
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,530
<font color="yellow">I'm just an old woman.</font>

719
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,640
<font color="yellow">Where did your confidence go?</font>

720
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,360
<font color="yellow">Don't pay attention to what other people say.</font>

721
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,040
<font color="yellow">Doing that becomes hard at my age.</font>

722
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,520
<font color="yellow">When I was young,</font>

723
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,270
<font color="yellow">I could grab a hot potato in my hand fully knowing that it's hot...</font>

724
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,740
<font color="yellow">and that it'd burn my hand.</font>

725
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,340
<font color="yellow">But I don't do that any more. I don't want to do it, either.</font>

726
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,700
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

727
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,210
<font color="yellow">what do you do now instead?</font>

728
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,900
<font color="yellow">I wait until it cools down...</font>

729
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,040
<font color="yellow">to make sure that I don't burn my hand and that I'm safe.</font>

730
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,120
<font color="yellow">I'm becoming less reckless and more cautious as I age,</font>

731
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,140
<font color="yellow">and I avoid jumping into dangerous things at all cost.</font>

732
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

733
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,940
<font color="yellow">I guess I was too self-centred.</font>

734
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

735
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,300
<font color="yellow">Everyone is leaving now.</font>

736
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,400
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

737
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,700
<font color="yellow">It's possible that what I missed was...</font>

738
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,700
<font color="yellow">not someone I can love,</font>

739
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,240
<font color="yellow">but feeling the emotion of love itself.</font>

740
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,370
<font color="yellow">Is the class over now?</font>

741
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,440
<font color="yellow">Put on some music for me, Sang Sik.</font>

742
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,640
<font color="yellow">You silly.</font>

743
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

744
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:57,940
<font color="yellow">How is it? Do you like it?</font>

745
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,990
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've always liked...</font>

746
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,640
<font color="yellow">your taste in music.</font>

747
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,070
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Did something happen?</font>

748
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,040
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

749
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,900
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo.</font>

750
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,070
<font color="yellow">I find it very difficult...</font>

751
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,000
<font color="yellow">to be with Min Joo.</font>

752
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,540
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

753
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,570
<font color="yellow">I liked how she's maturer than me.</font>

754
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,300
<font color="yellow">Well, I still like her, of course.</font>

755
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,740
<font color="yellow">But is it because she's older than me?</font>

756
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,400
<font color="yellow">I don't think she likes my way of doing things.</font>

757
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,300
<font color="yellow">That's not possible.</font>

758
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,470
<font color="yellow">You're so good to her. What more would she want?</font>

759
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,000
<font color="yellow">I might be too young for her.</font>

760
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,070
<font color="yellow">There could be a generation gap.</font>

761
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:56,900
<font color="yellow">However, you're...</font>

762
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,240
<font color="yellow">like an old man inside.</font>

763
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,270
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

764
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,540
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo.</font>

765
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:04,370
<font color="yellow">I'm really...</font>

766
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:08,470
<font color="yellow">happy to hear that you started liking someone.</font>

767
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,470
<font color="yellow">You've never liked Min Joo.</font>

768
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,450
<font color="yellow">That's because I didn't know much about her back then.</font>

769
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,510
<font color="yellow">When you like someone,</font>

770
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,140
<font color="yellow">you often get into conflicts with that person.</font>

771
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,770
<font color="yellow">There are also bad things about that person.</font>

772
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,940
<font color="yellow">You find out things that you don't like about them.</font>

773
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,270
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

774
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,200
<font color="yellow">I think you're in the process of getting to know each other.</font>

775
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:38,200
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

776
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,800
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who should thank you.</font>

777
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

778
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,120
<font color="yellow">You're still young, and I was afraid...</font>

779
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,170
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't date anyone.</font>

780
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,200
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

781
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,170
<font color="yellow">Why does age matter in dating?</font>

782
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,600
<font color="yellow">My only wish is that you'd find someone nice.</font>

783
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,240
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

784
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,540
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mum.</font>

785
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,470
<font color="yellow">How's Dad?</font>

786
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,840
<font color="yellow">It's still in early stages,</font>

787
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,540
<font color="yellow">so he won't get worse as long as he gets regular treatment.</font>

788
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,170
<font color="yellow">I really hope so.</font>

789
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,070
<font color="yellow">I'm here for him, so don't worry about your father.</font>

790
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,340
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep calling when you must be busy?</font>

791
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,940
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to talk to you and Dad.</font>

792
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,770
<font color="yellow">I must be getting old, too.</font>

793
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,200
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about getting old in front of me.</font>

794
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,940
<font color="yellow">You're still young.</font>

795
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,470
<font color="yellow">Aren't you feeling that way since you only work and don't date?</font>

796
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:36,640
<font color="yellow">Perhaps. It's been so long since I dated someone.</font>

797
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,140
<font color="yellow">I think my heart is broken.</font>

798
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,310
<font color="yellow">If it's difficult to find someone you like,</font>

799
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,440
<font color="yellow">date someone who treats you well and loves you very much.</font>

800
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,400
<font color="yellow">Then the rest of your life will be easy.</font>

801
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

802
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,670
<font color="yellow">Do you really think so?</font>

803
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,050
<font color="yellow">Honey, will you be home early tonight?</font>

804
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,520
<font color="yellow">- Why?
-  Why?</font>

805
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,070
<font color="yellow">It's because you're home late these days.</font>

806
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,200
<font color="yellow">I think Dad exercises after work.</font>

807
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,570
<font color="yellow">He even has muscles here.</font>

808
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,280
<font color="yellow">Exercise?</font>

809
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,470
<font color="yellow">I just thought I should regain my stamina.</font>

810
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,540
<font color="yellow">I guess he works out these days.</font>

811
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,440
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

812
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,530
<font color="yellow">He doesn't work out at all.</font>

813
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,790
<font color="yellow">He stays home all day even when I ask him to go to the spring with me.</font>

814
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,440
<font color="yellow">The only exercise he does is breathing.</font>

815
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,520
<font color="yellow">That must be why. You should have told me so we can go together.</font>

816
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,030
<font color="yellow">What kind of exercise do you do?</font>

817
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,840
<font color="yellow">I go to a health club near the school.</font>

818
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,280
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know. I should get you some herbal medicine.</font>

819
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,720
<font color="yellow">Don't waste money on useless things.</font>

820
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,040
<font color="yellow">You're not anything useless.</font>

821
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,420
<font color="yellow">Come home early tonight since I'm making samgyetang.</font>

822
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,080
<font color="yellow">I want baeksuk made with Korean chicken.</font>

823
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,240
<font color="yellow">You're so tactless. Stop interfering.</font>

824
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,240
<font color="yellow">Do you know what day is today?</font>

825
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,700
<font color="yellow">Of course I do. It's the day to submit class evaluations.</font>

826
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,300
<font color="yellow">We're leaving now, Sang Sik.</font>

827
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,800
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

828
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,090
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

829
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:25,440
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, why did I get married?</font>

830
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,940
<font color="yellow">Don't start that already. See you.</font>

831
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

832
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,870
<font color="yellow">Come on, everyone, get up.</font>

833
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,200
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

834
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,690

836
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,470

<font color="yellow">I'm in a hurry.</font>

839
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,670
<font color="yellow">Could you close the door?</font>

840
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,170
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

841
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,470
<font color="yellow">Writer Na said she's in a hurry.</font>

842
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:19,900

00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,840
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

844
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,340
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

845
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,370
<font color="yellow">You can wash here.</font>

846
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,640

00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,040
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

850
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,200
<font color="yellow">I know it's possible,</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm not underaged right now.</font>

860
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,940
<font color="yellow">Plus, why do you think Chief Ko shouldn't date?</font>

861
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,970
<font color="yellow">As a person in charge of official duties...</font>

<font color="yellow">Has my dating Chief Ko stopped you...</font>

864
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,000
<font color="yellow">from carrying official duties?</font>

865
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,270
<font color="yellow">This is strictly my personal life.</font>

866
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,840

867
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,670

<font color="yellow">I don't agree with it.</font>

872
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:09,380
<font color="yellow">It's not that she's waiting for a man to love.</font>

873
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,400
<font color="yellow">Her missing the feeling of wanting to love sounds more convincing.</font>
