00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,200
<font color="yellow">I can...</font>

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,020
<font color="yellow">certainly look after a garden.</font>

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,530
<font color="yellow">I moved all the way here because I wanted to try these things.</font>

4
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,750
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,130
<font color="yellow">Why was I so busy...</font>

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,870
<font color="yellow">when I was young...</font>

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,930
<font color="yellow">to try anything?</font>

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,630
<font color="yellow">Now, I've become an adult who can't challenge herself...</font>

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,500
<font color="yellow">because she's afraid of what other people would think.</font>

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,230
<font color="yellow">People keep looking at me.</font>

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,400
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about other people.</font>

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,000
<font color="yellow">Who cares if they look?</font>

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,580
<font color="yellow">Starting now, you're the centre of the world.</font>

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,900
<font color="yellow">And then you do this.</font>

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,430
<font color="yellow">Lift it up.</font>

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,250
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,270
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,470
<font color="yellow">I can't do it.</font>

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,200
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Try one more time.</font>

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,900
<font color="yellow">You're doing well.</font>

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,430
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,930
<font color="yellow">This is so fun.</font>

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,300
<font color="yellow">Try it again.</font>

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,300
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,700
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,700
<font color="yellow">(Second to Last Love)</font>

29
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,670
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right?
-  I'm going to be sore later.</font>

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,130
<font color="yellow">You could've done better if you weren't so scared.</font>

31
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,840
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come again tomorrow?</font>

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,870
<font color="yellow">No, I really can't do it.</font>

33
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,130
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,970
<font color="yellow">I have cooking class today.</font>

35
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,570
<font color="yellow">Cooking class?</font>

36
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,300
<font color="yellow">- You're teaching?
-  Yes.</font>

37
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,920
<font color="yellow">We're having a dessert party later.</font>

38
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I took so much of your time.</font>

39
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,730
<font color="yellow">No, it's you who made time for me.</font>

40
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,560
<font color="yellow">You should come. I know you wanted to learn cooking.</font>

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,900
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I don't have the time and I'm busy.</font>

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,570
<font color="yellow">Is that the reason why you never got to try what you wanted?</font>

43
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,070
<font color="yellow">You brought this out...</font>

44
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,970
<font color="yellow">because you don't want to live like that any more.</font>

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,200
<font color="yellow">You're right, but it's really hard to do.</font>

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,600
<font color="yellow">Just take baby steps and take it easy.</font>

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,470
<font color="yellow">You'll regret it if you push it to later again.</font>

48
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,870
<font color="yellow">My dad bought it three years ago when he was interested in cameras,</font>

49
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,700
<font color="yellow">but he didn't even take pictures of my graduation. It's almost new.</font>

50
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,530
<font color="yellow">Three years? That's old. I'll give you 350 dollars.</font>

51
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,270
<font color="yellow">Is he crazy?</font>

52
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,000
<font color="yellow">Does he know how much this is?</font>

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,600
<font color="yellow">Go buy it from someone else.</font>

54
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
<font color="yellow">420 dollars.</font>

55
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,970
<font color="yellow">500 dollars. That's the lowest I can go.</font>

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,480
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for coming all the way here.</font>

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,920
<font color="yellow">I'm so lucky to have a good neighbour. Now, Hoon has a teacher.</font>

58
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,490
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's nothing. Is he inside?</font>

59
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,510
<font color="yellow">Of course. He's been waiting for you.</font>

60
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,670
<font color="yellow">Hoon, your tutor is here.</font>

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,330
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hello, you must be Hoon.</font>

62
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,910
<font color="yellow">Do you take after your dad? You're very handsome.</font>

63
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,070
<font color="yellow">I take after my mum.</font>

64
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,850
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

65
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,880
<font color="yellow">We're very lucky to have her, so you better behave.</font>

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,990
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

67
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,890
<font color="yellow">I'll go get you some fruits.</font>

68
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,700
<font color="yellow">- Make yourself at home.
-  Okay.</font>

69
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,170
<font color="yellow">- Please sit here.
-  No, I'll just sit here.</font>

70
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,200
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

71
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,530
<font color="yellow">The lens...</font>

72
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,660
<font color="yellow">You broke it.</font>

73
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,100
<font color="yellow">Why did you put it there?</font>

74
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,130
<font color="yellow">Pay me 53 dollars to fix it.</font>

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,070
<font color="yellow">No discounts.</font>

76
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,370
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,890
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Welcome.</font>

78
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,970
<font color="yellow">It's so hot.</font>

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,820
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hello.</font>

80
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,200
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  How are you?</font>

81
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,870
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting for someone?</font>

82
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,100
<font color="yellow">- How did you know?
-  Don't you know me?</font>

83
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,800
<font color="yellow">I can tell how you're feeling just by looking at your shadow.</font>

84
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,700
<font color="yellow">Min Joo promised to come.</font>

85
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,640
<font color="yellow">Our neighbour?</font>

86
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,370
<font color="yellow">Are you two really dating?</font>

87
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,670
<font color="yellow">If she shows up today,</font>

88
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,930
<font color="yellow">I hope to make today our first day.</font>

89
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,130
<font color="yellow">- The first day?
-  The first day of going out.</font>

90
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,630
<font color="yellow">If she comes today,</font>

91
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,040
<font color="yellow">it means that today is the first day of our relationship.</font>

92
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,700
<font color="yellow">Why do people care about those things?</font>

93
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,420
<font color="yellow">And why do they count such number of days?</font>

94
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,990
<font color="yellow">How do you define a beginning of a relationship?</font>

95
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,620
<font color="yellow">Do couples try to come to an agreement if they think differently?</font>

96
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,020
<font color="yellow">Can you just pick any day you want?</font>

97
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's exactly what I did. Are we good now?</font>

98
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,490
<font color="yellow">I'm a fool for telling you these things.</font>

99
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you little...</font>

100
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,900
<font color="yellow">I see some new plants. Did you buy them?</font>

101
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,130
<font color="yellow">I did, of course. Do you think they just sprang out of the ground?</font>

102
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,370
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

103
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,430
<font color="yellow">- Move over, please.
-  Gosh, seriously.</font>

104
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,870
<font color="yellow">Hey. It's you, Mi Rae.</font>

105
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>

106
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,400
<font color="yellow">What... What brings you here?</font>

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I'm here?</font>

108
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,630
<font color="yellow">I came to see Jun Woo.</font>

109
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,030
<font color="yellow">Have you had dinner yet?</font>

110
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,030
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

111
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,600
<font color="yellow">Oh, aren't you going to Uncle Jun Woo's dessert party today?</font>

112
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,770
<font color="yellow">Just focus on one thing at a time,</font>

113
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,800
<font color="yellow">whether it's studying or exercising.</font>

114
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,030
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

115
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,500
<font color="yellow">I'm done!</font>

116
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,270
<font color="yellow">Ever since she moved up to grade eight, she's turned into a brat.</font>

117
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,020
<font color="yellow">We have a member whose birthday is today,</font>

118
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,460
<font color="yellow">so we'll make desserts that are perfect for birthday parties.</font>

119
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,400
<font color="yellow">Who's going to assist me today?</font>

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
<font color="yellow">Over there. The new member.</font>

121
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,300
<font color="yellow">Come on out. I won't give you difficult tasks since you're new.</font>

122
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,770
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

123
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,040
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen Jun Woo's desserts in so long.</font>

124
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,630
<font color="yellow">Ji Sun. Jun Woo's class began, so I should get going now.</font>

125
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,500
<font color="yellow">Sure. See you later.</font>

126
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,600
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

127
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,040
<font color="yellow">We have to save these desserts for the party later.</font>

128
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,070
<font color="yellow">There are so many of them. I'll just eat one.</font>

129
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,360
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be petty about food, either.</font>

130
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,670
<font color="yellow">But if Jun Woo finds out...</font>

131
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,500
<font color="yellow">Just tell him that I'm here.</font>

132
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,370
<font color="yellow">I won't interrupt his class.</font>

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,070
<font color="yellow">These are mined carrots and pecans.</font>

134
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
<font color="yellow">This is coconut.</font>

135
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,380
<font color="yellow">If you use these ingredients together,</font>

136
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,600
<font color="yellow">the texture and the nutty taste...</font>

137
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,000
<font color="yellow">will be greatly enhanced.</font>

138
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,110
<font color="yellow">Due to the texture of carrots,</font>

139
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,100
<font color="yellow">even those who dislike the sweet taste of carrots will like this.</font>

140
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,740
<font color="yellow">Please add soy milk in it instead of milk.</font>

141
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,870
<font color="yellow">Gosh! Oh, no!</font>

142
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,700
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it! Goodness.</font>

143
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,900
<font color="yellow">How much soy milk should I add?</font>

144
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,880
<font color="yellow">Three cups, please.</font>

145
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,900
<font color="yellow">Sure!</font>

146
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,660
<font color="yellow">What in the world are you doing here now?</font>

147
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,370
<font color="yellow">You actually changed your phone number.</font>

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,170
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm here.</font>

149
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,400
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any pride?</font>

150
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,300
<font color="yellow">I told you that you're being a nuisance to me.</font>

151
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,300
<font color="yellow">It's that woman, isn't it?</font>

152
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,670
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  You said you're seeing someone.</font>

153
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,700
<font color="yellow">The one who was assisting you.</font>

154
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,940
<font color="yellow">I could tell from the way you were looking at her.</font>

155
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,830
<font color="yellow">I mean, how would I not know?</font>

156
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,830
<font color="yellow">Just bear with me for just a month.</font>

157
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,530
<font color="yellow">A month?</font>

158
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,130
<font color="yellow">My old agency got in touch with me.</font>

159
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,640
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go back to modelling...</font>

160
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,100
<font color="yellow">and walk the runways again.</font>

161
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,130
<font color="yellow">So let me stay here for just one month.</font>

162
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,970
<font color="yellow">I'll just stay by your side.</font>

163
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,830
<font color="yellow">Think of me as a part-time helper.</font>

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
<font color="yellow">You're going to work here for a month?</font>

165
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
<font color="yellow">Leave immediately and don't come back ever again.</font>

166
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,480
<font color="yellow">I might actually call the police if you show up like this again.</font>

167
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,870
<font color="yellow">If you hate me that much, just be nice to me so that I'd leave sooner.</font>

168
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,440
<font color="yellow">You're a jerk.</font>

169
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
<font color="yellow">You're so horrible.</font>

170
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo.</font>

171
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,440
<font color="yellow">People are waiting. Come on.</font>

172
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

173
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,530
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

174
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

175
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,300
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

176
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,030
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. It's okay.</font>

177
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,370
<font color="yellow">She's pretty, but she looks a bit old.</font>

178
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,530
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

179
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,060
<font color="yellow">Were you just talking about me?</font>

180
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,400
<font color="yellow">Did you finish reading that?</font>

181
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,830
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

182
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
<font color="yellow">Then I'll take it.</font>

183
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,700
<font color="yellow">Wait, I'm not sure if you can take that with you.</font>

184
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,100
<font color="yellow">I'm a fan of his.</font>

185
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,530
<font color="yellow">Do you like this guy?</font>

186
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

187
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,370
<font color="yellow">Have you tried soy sauce bibimbap?</font>

188
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,670
<font color="yellow">It's his speciality.</font>

189
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,570
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

190
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,390
<font color="yellow">What about bulgogi japchae?</font>

191
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,700
<font color="yellow">I haven't tried that, either.</font>

192
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

193
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,570
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

194
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me those things?</font>

195
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,400
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

196
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,330
<font color="yellow">She looks so young, too.</font>

197
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,530
<font color="yellow">And why is she so tall? Goodness.</font>

198
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,670
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if this is the right time to tell you this, but...</font>

199
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,930
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo's girlfriend?</font>

200
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,930
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You're not making much sense right now.</font>

201
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,370
<font color="yellow">I saw him when I was on a blind date a few days ago.</font>

202
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,170
<font color="yellow">He was being so cold and rude to a young lady.</font>

203
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,800
<font color="yellow">It looked like they were intimately involved.</font>

204
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,470
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is that what you know about him now...</font>

205
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,430
<font color="yellow">may not be everything.</font>

206
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,900
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's talk again later. Bye!</font>

207
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,760
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I made you my assistant and couldn't pay attention to you.</font>

208
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,330
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. I'm sorry I'm not good enough to be more helpful.</font>

209
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,610
<font color="yellow">Then promise me that you'll attend every class.</font>

210
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,200
<font color="yellow">I'll try. It's more fun than I expected.</font>

211
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,240
<font color="yellow">By the way, it looks like you have a lot of fans.</font>

212
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,380
<font color="yellow">Fans?</font>

213
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,420
<font color="yellow">A tall lady said that she's your fan...</font>

214
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,110
<font color="yellow">and took the magazine that you were in.</font>

215
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,010
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

216
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,230
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

217
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,330
<font color="yellow">Have you ever made a special dish for someone?</font>

218
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,400
<font color="yellow">Well, I've lived long enough to have done it at least once.</font>

219
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,850
<font color="yellow">I'm good at making ramyeon. Don't underestimate me too much.</font>

220
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,600
<font color="yellow">I must try your ramyeon.</font>

221
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,700
<font color="yellow">For whom have you cooked, then?</font>

222
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,700
<font color="yellow">Well, in my case,</font>

223
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,470
<font color="yellow">I always cook for my family and customers.</font>

224
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,100
<font color="yellow">Also, when I was living in Canada...</font>

225
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,830
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

226
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,400
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Why did you stop in the middle of talking?</font>

227
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,830
<font color="yellow">Today is our first day.</font>

228
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,490
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Our first day?</font>

229
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,000
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know now. Thanks for coming today anyway.</font>

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,150
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

231
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,700
<font color="yellow">All right. See you.</font>

232
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,200
<font color="yellow">Today is our first day.</font>

233
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,470
<font color="yellow">I saw that you planted those seedlings already.</font>

234
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,270
<font color="yellow">Can I raise these seedlings if you don't mind?</font>

235
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,850
<font color="yellow">No, you can't.</font>

236
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously. I can do a good job. I won't kill them.</font>

237
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,030
<font color="yellow">Are you confident that you won't kill them?</font>

238
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,070
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

239
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,940
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. I saw this notebook, too.</font>

240
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,170
<font color="yellow">I just have to follow these instructions, no?</font>

241
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,270
<font color="yellow">That's not everything.</font>

242
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,070
<font color="yellow">If you're unsure about anything, look it up on the internet.</font>

243
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,130
<font color="yellow">Really? So you're letting me...</font>

244
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,130
<font color="yellow">take care of this garden, right? Don't change your words later.</font>

245
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,110
<font color="yellow">Think of it as my act of kindness for a resident.</font>

246
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,020
<font color="yellow">For a resident?</font>

247
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,300
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

248
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,870
<font color="yellow">You're a resident of our city now.</font>

249
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,900
<font color="yellow">Yes. Thank you.</font>

250
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,630
<font color="yellow">An act of kindness for a resident?</font>

251
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,090
<font color="yellow">A project for promoting Woori City?</font>

252
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,220
<font color="yellow">Yes. Let's come up with ideas that can help us this summer.</font>

253
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,390
<font color="yellow">We need something practical that can be done right away.</font>

254
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,810
<font color="yellow">Social media is certainly the way to go.</font>

255
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,460
<font color="yellow">We won't have to do much if we use social networks effectively.</font>

256
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,590
<font color="yellow">Let's do that, then.</font>

257
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,890
<font color="yellow">What's important is how we'll utilise which social media channels.</font>

258
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,030
<font color="yellow">What will our content be and how will we share it?</font>

259
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,880
<font color="yellow">How about we come up with a song for Woori City?</font>

260
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,510
<font color="yellow">- A song?
-  That's right.</font>

261
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,490
<font color="yellow">We can use our mascot, the squirrel, to let people know of our song.</font>

262
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,030
<font color="yellow">Such tactic is frequently used in election campaigns.</font>

263
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,000
<font color="yellow">A drama about Woori City?</font>

264
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
<font color="yellow">Min Joo.</font>

265
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,260
<font color="yellow">I want you to take this on.</font>

266
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,580
<font color="yellow">Director Gook.</font>

267
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,230
<font color="yellow">I know that I'm in the planning team now, but if you make me do this...</font>

268
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,320
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this project?</font>

269
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,760
<font color="yellow">You're asking me to make a drama that promotes the city hall.</font>

270
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,590
<font color="yellow">That is not true. How many times do I have to...</font>

271
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,760
<font color="yellow">Give it to someone else.</font>

272
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,380
<font color="yellow">You're really not going to take it, right?</font>

273
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,600
<font color="yellow">Director Gook, I'll do it.</font>

274
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
<font color="yellow">Shut it, you silly.</font>

275
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,110
<font color="yellow">She doesn't want to do it.</font>

276
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,900
<font color="yellow">An opportunity like this doesn't come by easily.</font>

277
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,800
<font color="yellow">All broadcasting companies have their eyes set on this.</font>

278
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,330
<font color="yellow">And you're saying no?</font>

279
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,060
<font color="yellow">I guess she didn't know.</font>

280
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,450
<font color="yellow">You're so out of touch with what's going on.</font>

281
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,930
<font color="yellow">Min Joo, it looks like no one tells you anything any more.</font>

282
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
<font color="yellow">If another network ends up scoring this project,</font>

283
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,370
<font color="yellow">I'll be fired.</font>

284
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,700
<font color="yellow">I wasn't aware.</font>

285
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,000
<font color="yellow">Then I'll review the proposal and think about it.</font>

286
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,370
<font color="yellow">"Woori City Song".</font>

287
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,850
<font color="yellow">So you're suggesting that we should make a song about our city.</font>

288
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,760
<font color="yellow">Yes. Those are some of the ideas...</font>

289
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,270
<font color="yellow">that we came up with today regarding boosting tourism this summer.</font>

290
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,630
<font color="yellow">I like the idea. I'm actually a good singer myself.</font>

291
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,870
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me?
-  Let's make a great song together.</font>

292
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,070
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

293
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,300
<font color="yellow">But as I mentioned to you the other day, I'm not sure about the drama.</font>

294
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,220
<font color="yellow">Head Chief Shin will be in charge of the drama project,</font>

295
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,630
<font color="yellow">so you don't need to worry about it.</font>

296
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,280
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

297
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,070
<font color="yellow">why do you hate dramas so much?</font>

298
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,200
<font color="yellow">Do you really never watch them?</font>

299
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,530
<font color="yellow">That's right. I'd much rather watch the news and shows...</font>

300
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,230
<font color="yellow">about current events as well as documentaries.</font>

301
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,070
<font color="yellow">Where should we go for lunch today?</font>

302
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,470
<font color="yellow">I'll eat at the cafeteria.</font>

303
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, is there something you need to discuss with me?</font>

304
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,000
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

305
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,080
<font color="yellow">I don't have much appetite these days,</font>

306
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,600
<font color="yellow">so I was asking to see if you have any recommendations for lunch.</font>

307
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,030
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

308
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,870
<font color="yellow">Well, if that's the case...</font>

309
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,830
<font color="yellow">Do you like naengmyeon? I know of a good restaurant.</font>

310
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,170
<font color="yellow">Which one is better between this...</font>

311
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,180
<font color="yellow">- and this blazer?
-  Pardon me?</font>

312
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,700
<font color="yellow">Which one suits me better in your opinion?</font>

313
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,800
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

314
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,300
<font color="yellow">For what you're wearing now, I think this one will be better.</font>

315
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,970
<font color="yellow">Then I'll wear the other one.</font>

316
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,470
<font color="yellow">Did you say that you know of a good naengmyeon place?</font>

317
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,680
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  Then text me...</font>

318
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,500
<font color="yellow">the restaurant's address.</font>

319
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,400
<font color="yellow">Last but not least, I hope you enjoy your lunch at the cafeteria.</font>

320
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

321
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,170
<font color="yellow">- Have a great day, Sir.
-  You, too.</font>

322
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,330
<font color="yellow">- I hope you enjoyed the food.
-  Yes, thank you.</font>

323
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,640
<font color="yellow">The wait won't be too long.</font>

324
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ma'am.</font>

325
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,070
<font color="yellow">- Are you here alone?
-  Yes.</font>

326
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,400
<font color="yellow">- Why do you ask?
-  Please come with me.</font>

327
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

328
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,570
<font color="yellow">Please take this seat.</font>

329
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,070
<font color="yellow">Is this the only table that's available?</font>

330
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,140
<font color="yellow">Yes. Come and take order from Table Number 13!</font>

331
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,910
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ma'am. What would you like to order?</font>

332
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,030
<font color="yellow">I'd like a bowl of mulnaengmyeon.</font>

333
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,530
<font color="yellow">I'd like mulnaengmyeon with no ice.</font>

334
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,970
<font color="yellow">- I'll get mine without ice, too.
-  Sure.</font>

335
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,170
<font color="yellow">You can take it. I don't need it.</font>

336
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,680
<font color="yellow">No, please leave it here.</font>

337
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,670
<font color="yellow">I never said that I don't need it.</font>

338
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,200
<font color="yellow">I apologise. I thought you two were together.</font>

339
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,400
<font color="yellow">The naengmyeon here is more delicious without it.</font>

340
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

341
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,680
<font color="yellow">Please try without it first.</font>

342
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,370
<font color="yellow">Adding all sorts of things...</font>

343
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,030
<font color="yellow">ruins the authentic flavour of the buckwheat noodles.</font>

344
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,570
<font color="yellow">How is it?</font>

345
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,870
<font color="yellow">It's a little bland,</font>

346
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,000
<font color="yellow">but it's not bad.</font>

347
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,970
<font color="yellow">Eating bland things are good for people at our age.</font>

348
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,350
<font color="yellow">How old are you? Why do you assume that we'd be around the same age?</font>

349
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,410
<font color="yellow">We're both ageing. Who cares about 1 or 2 years of age difference?</font>

350
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,690
<font color="yellow">The fact that you're eating this here alone at this hour is enough...</font>

351
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,700
<font color="yellow">for me to assume that you're an old lady who is bored and lonely.</font>

352
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,900
<font color="yellow">Did you just call me an old lady?</font>

353
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,400
<font color="yellow">I look at least five years younger than you!</font>

354
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,470
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

355
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,470
<font color="yellow">I just thought that your blazer looks too old-fashioned.</font>

356
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,470
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

357
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,170
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

358
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,140
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

359
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

360
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,180
<font color="yellow">I'd love to work with you on a drama about Woori City.</font>

361
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,980
<font color="yellow">I'd love to, but I don't think I can commit to it now.</font>

362
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,070
<font color="yellow">Please let me know if another opportunity pops up in the future.</font>

363
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,900
<font color="yellow">Thanks for thinking of me,</font>

364
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,170
<font color="yellow">but another network approached me about it already.</font>

365
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,780
<font color="yellow">It looks like we will be competing against each other.</font>

366
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,680
<font color="yellow">You're so out of touch.</font>

367
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,830
<font color="yellow">It was announced today,</font>

368
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,170
<font color="yellow">but everyone in the industry found out about it a few days ago.</font>

369
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,470
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

370
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,200
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

371
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,230
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang.</font>

372
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,070
<font color="yellow">Can I be honest with you?</font>

373
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,580
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

374
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,690
<font color="yellow">People at work are saying that you're not like you used to be.</font>

375
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,400
<font color="yellow">No one would obviously want to work with you on it.</font>

376
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,600
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

377
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,240
<font color="yellow">People are saying...</font>

378
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,570
<font color="yellow">that you're not as good as you used to be...</font>

379
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,140
<font color="yellow">and that you've lost your zeal and drive due to your old age.</font>

380
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,000
<font color="yellow">You've been rejecting all the good ideas.</font>

381
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,870
<font color="yellow">So it looks like writers are avoiding to work with you.</font>

382
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,470
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

383
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,530
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

384
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,570
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

385
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,370
<font color="yellow">Thanks for telling me.</font>

386
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,170
<font color="yellow">If we drag it on like this, it won't even get scheduled for next year.</font>

387
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,300
<font color="yellow">The two of you should negotiate or come to an agreement.</font>

388
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,570
<font color="yellow">Can one of you give in, please?</font>

389
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,630
<font color="yellow">You don't even have another writer in mind for co-writing this with me.</font>

390
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,560
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang, did you take on the drama about Woori City?</font>

391
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,700
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

392
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,400
<font color="yellow">The drama about Woori City?</font>

393
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,870
<font color="yellow">When will I debut as a director, then?</font>

394
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,120
<font color="yellow">Also, what will happen to Writer Na?</font>

395
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,260
<font color="yellow">Why are you so worried?</font>

396
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,870
<font color="yellow">You'll be able to debut if Writer Na's script turns out well.</font>

397
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,900
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang, you can't do this to me.</font>

398
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,520
<font color="yellow">You made me work like a dog,</font>

399
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,600
<font color="yellow">but you're working on something else behind my back?</font>

400
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,430
<font color="yellow">She'd never do that.</font>

401
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,870
<font color="yellow">It's not true, right?</font>

402
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,370
<font color="yellow">- I'm thinking about it.
-  Goodness!</font>

403
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,100
<font color="yellow">Producer Han has already started on the next drama.</font>

404
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,200
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang, you might end up losing your job at this rate.</font>

405
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,530
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

406
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,430
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

407
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,370
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

408
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,200
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

409
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,300
<font color="yellow">(Ms Na Choon Woo, your order for the lingerie has been shipped.)</font>

410
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,570
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

411
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,440
<font color="yellow">"Women's sexy chiffon lingerie"?</font>

412
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,870
<font color="yellow">"Ms Na Choon Woo."</font>

413
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,700
<font color="yellow">Na Choon Woo. Who is Na Choon Woo?</font>

414
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,170
<font color="yellow">- No, no.
-  Gosh!</font>

415
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,150
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  No, I was just...</font>

416
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,170
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable!</font>

417
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,670
<font color="yellow">Right. That's when my phone got switched with hers.</font>

418
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,470
<font color="yellow">"Flaunt your sexy charms all you want..."</font>

419
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,100
<font color="yellow">"and enjoy a steamy night."</font>

420
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,200
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this old lady is a piece of work.</font>

421
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,600
<font color="yellow">The battery is dying.</font>

422
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,330
<font color="yellow">What? This blazer looks old-fashioned?</font>

423
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,530
<font color="yellow">That ridiculous old man.</font>

424
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

425
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,810
<font color="yellow">I do not answer telemarketing calls.</font>

426
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,870
<font color="yellow">Wait, hello? Is this Ms Na Choon Woo?</font>

427
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,850
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

428
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,440
<font color="yellow">You ate naengmyeon at Bimatgol for lunch today, right?</font>

429
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,470
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

430
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,500
<font color="yellow">Why are you stalking me?</font>

431
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,700
<font color="yellow">Who would be stalking a grandmother like you?</font>

432
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,700
<font color="yellow">I called to tell you that our phones got mixed up.</font>

433
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

434
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,970
<font color="yellow">No, this is mine. What trick are you trying to pull?</font>

435
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,700
<font color="yellow">Then hang up the phone and look at it carefully.</font>

436
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,040
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

437
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,830
<font color="yellow">What is he talking about?</font>

438
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,330
<font color="yellow">This is... It's that pervert from the restaurant!</font>

439
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,230
<font color="yellow">They say that you're not as good as you used to be...</font>

440
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,800
<font color="yellow">and that you've lost your zeal and drive due to your old age.</font>

441
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,670
<font color="yellow">You've been rejecting all the good ideas.</font>

442
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,470
<font color="yellow">So it looks like writers are avoiding to work with you.</font>

443
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,100
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

444
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,120
<font color="yellow">Hello. Are you coming home from work?</font>

445
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,270
<font color="yellow">Yes. What are you doing here?</font>

446
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,770
<font color="yellow">I'm just studying people.</font>

447
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,770
<font color="yellow">People?</font>

448
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,950
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

449
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,400
<font color="yellow">I tend to have a closed mind if I stay at home,</font>

450
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,580
<font color="yellow">so I hike up the mountain sometimes...</font>

451
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,570
<font color="yellow">and ride on the subway even when I don't have to go anywhere.</font>

452
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,430
<font color="yellow">But then I run back home when I get sick by the crowds.</font>

453
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,530
<font color="yellow">That could happen to people who work at home.</font>

454
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,140
<font color="yellow">It's good to be focused on your career,</font>

455
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,230

458
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,430
<font color="yellow">Really? Right now?</font>

459
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,810
<font color="yellow">Yes, hurry up.</font>

460
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,110
<font color="yellow">If we don't go now, there won't be any left.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hey, can you hold onto this for a minute?</font>

462
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,930
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

463
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,120
<font color="yellow">The new ones are on the shelves.</font>

464

465
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
<font color="yellow">- Hurry!
-  Let's go!</font>

466
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,170

470
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,900
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

471
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,360
<font color="yellow">I was waiting and you didn't come, so I took your laptop home.</font>

472
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,890
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at home.</font>

473

<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.</font>

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,700
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you come out yesterday? All the mums got together.</font>

477
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,340
<font color="yellow">Didn't Ye Ji tell you?</font>

478
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,240
<font color="yellow">No, she didn't. What was it about?</font>

479
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,860
<font color="yellow">It was just a gathering for mums with daughters.</font>

480
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,810
<font color="yellow">We gave advice to each other while sharing information.</font>

482
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,610
<font color="yellow">How is Ye Ji these days?</font>

483
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,570
<font color="yellow">My daughter told me that Ye Ji often goes to the library with Hyun Seok.</font>

484
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,130
<font color="yellow">She told me that they even download music for each other.</font>

485
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,670
<font color="yellow">I see. Thank you for letting me know.</font>

486
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,870
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you later.</font>

487
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,970
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

488
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,570
<font color="yellow">We can't French kiss yet,</font>

489
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,270
<font color="yellow">but we can kiss.</font>

490
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,970
<font color="yellow">What? Kiss?</font>

491
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,610
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

492
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,800
<font color="yellow">I'm happy with just holding your hand.</font>

493
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,370
<font color="yellow">Really.</font>

494
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,470
<font color="yellow">I don't mind this much.</font>

495
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji...</font>

496
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,310
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

497
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,170
<font color="yellow">Why her?</font>

498
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,270
<font color="yellow">This is annoying.</font>

499
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

500
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,830
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

501
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,500
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to run away?</font>

502
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,070
<font color="yellow">Kids these days are such troublemakers.</font>

503
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,470
<font color="yellow">- Hey, excuse me.
-  My goodness!</font>

504
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,230
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

505
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,410
<font color="yellow">What... What is it?</font>

506
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,440
<font color="yellow">What was that about just now?</font>

507
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
<font color="yellow">Are you being coy or acting innocent?</font>

508
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,970
<font color="yellow">Coy?</font>

509
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,170
<font color="yellow">Acting innocent?</font>

510
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,070
<font color="yellow">I know you saw us.</font>

511
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,400
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

512
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,020
<font color="yellow">- So what?
-  Don't tell Dad.</font>

513
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,810
<font color="yellow">Why would I tell him such a thing?</font>

514
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,470
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, "such a thing"?</font>

515
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you adults.</font>

516
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,160
<font color="yellow">Then why are you asking me not to tell him?</font>

517
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,670
<font color="yellow">Because my dad is old-fashioned.</font>

518
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,970
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, but he'll think it's a big deal if he hears it from you.</font>

519
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,600
<font color="yellow">In any case, I don't want to be in trouble.</font>

520
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,500
<font color="yellow">So just pretend you didn't see it.</font>

521
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,970
<font color="yellow">Isn't that my aunt's computer?</font>

522
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,520
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

523
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,610
<font color="yellow">Why do you have it?</font>

524
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,030
<font color="yellow">Because she left it with me.</font>

525
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,130
<font color="yellow">Give it to me then.</font>

526
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,130
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Tell her to come and get it herself.</font>

527
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,870
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you'll keep it a secret. Right?</font>

528
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,930
<font color="yellow">A secret?</font>

529
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,800
<font color="yellow">What will you do for me then?</font>

530
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,830
<font color="yellow">You're so mean.</font>

531
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,770
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

532
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,060
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

533
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

534
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,770
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

535
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,370
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to work with me?</font>

536
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,900
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

537
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,630
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you if you'd like to make your web comic...</font>

538
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,790
<font color="yellow">into a drama with me.</font>

539
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,800
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

540
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,620
<font color="yellow">No. How can I work on a drama?</font>

541
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,970
<font color="yellow">Although the order was mixed up,</font>

542
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:57,270
<font color="yellow">you already had your previous work become a drama before.</font>

543
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,790
<font color="yellow">Actually, I saw your latest work earlier today.</font>

544
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,060
<font color="yellow">What? No one is supposed to see it yet.</font>

545
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,090
<font color="yellow">I just started recently, so...</font>

546
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,200
<font color="yellow">It's pretty fun.</font>

547
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,630
<font color="yellow">I'm making an official offer to you.</font>

548
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,510
<font color="yellow">No, I can't do it.</font>

549
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,320
<font color="yellow">If I do it, I'd have to talk to other people,</font>

550
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,160
<font color="yellow">have meetings, try to get along,</font>

551
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,590
<font color="yellow">and make compromises and stuff.</font>

552
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,600
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

553
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,230
<font color="yellow">It's a good opportunity for you to become more social.</font>

554
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,770
<font color="yellow">Don't be afraid and think about it...</font>

555
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,690
<font color="yellow">before making a decision.</font>

556
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,700
<font color="yellow">Another decision?</font>

557
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,330
<font color="yellow">No, I... I don't want to do it.</font>

558
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,270
<font color="yellow">Thank you anyhow.</font>

559
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,930
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

560
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,810
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm coming in.</font>

561
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,830
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

562
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,570
<font color="yellow">All you do is roll around in your room.</font>

563
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,000
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to scold me?</font>

564
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,800
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

565
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,770
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you find a proper job now?</font>

566
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,520
<font color="yellow">Proper? Are you saying my job is improper?</font>

567
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,510
<font color="yellow">I know how hard you work,</font>

568
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,440
<font color="yellow">but life isn't about just working hard.</font>

569
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,470
<font color="yellow">You need luck and also people that give you opportunities.</font>

570
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,970
<font color="yellow">What is this? What have you been listening to?</font>

571
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,500
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

572
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,170
<font color="yellow">They say opportunity strikes only three times in your life.</font>

573
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,670
<font color="yellow">You don't have much time left.</font>

574
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,870
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

575
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,250
<font color="yellow">Get lost. Go. Leave.</font>

576
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,270
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

577
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,600
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Three times? How many times do I have left?</font>

578
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

579
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,670
<font color="yellow">I just talked to my aunt.</font>

580
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,670
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to persuade her until she says yes.</font>

581
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,470
<font color="yellow">You have to promise you won't tell Dad in return.</font>

582
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,570
<font color="yellow">Just coming in?</font>

583
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,970
<font color="yellow">Hey, I have to ask you something.</font>

584
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,170
<font color="yellow">The leaves on these cherry tomato plants are wilting.</font>

585
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,170
<font color="yellow">It's so strange.</font>

586
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,070
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

587
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,410
<font color="yellow">This one has aphids.</font>

588
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,770
<font color="yellow">Aphids?</font>

589
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,400
<font color="yellow">Will this plant die then?</font>

590
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,370
<font color="yellow">You should save it.</font>

591
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,770
<font color="yellow">Just spray some vinegar water on here.</font>

592
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,300
<font color="yellow">Vinegar water?</font>

593
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,270
<font color="yellow">How much of it?</font>

594
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,370
<font color="yellow">Wait here for a minute.</font>

595
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,670
<font color="yellow">- Sang Sik.
-  Hey.</font>

596
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,540
<font color="yellow">You're here, too.</font>

597
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,630
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

598
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,270
<font color="yellow">This one's mine,</font>

599
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,040
<font color="yellow">and this is a present for Min Joo.</font>

600
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,000
<font color="yellow">Why would you...</font>

601
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,490
<font color="yellow">Why do you think? Now, we can wear it together.</font>

602
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,570
<font color="yellow">You can wear it for the motorcycle or the skateboard.</font>

603
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,430
<font color="yellow">I think it'll look great on you.</font>

604
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,300
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Do you like it?</font>

605
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,230
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji.</font>

606
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji?</font>

607
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,040
<font color="yellow">Open the door, Ye Ji.</font>

608
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,270
<font color="yellow">Ko Ye Ji!</font>

609
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,770
<font color="yellow">Ko Ye Ji!</font>

610
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,390
<font color="yellow">What is it? I was listening to music and didn't hear.</font>

611
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,400
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

612
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,050
<font color="yellow">Why did you lock your door?</font>

613
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,370
<font color="yellow">Sometimes I want to be alone and uninterrupted, too.</font>

614
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,400
<font color="yellow">Were you on the phone?</font>

615
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,430
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

616
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,590
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep me standing here?</font>

617
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,700
<font color="yellow">What is it about?</font>

618
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,670
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

619
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,800
<font color="yellow">- Anything new?
-  Like what?</font>

620
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,040
<font color="yellow">- Maybe you're being bullied or...
-  No.</font>

621
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,870
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'm in the middle of talking with my friends.</font>

622
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,330
<font color="yellow">What is it about?</font>

623
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,700
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

624
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,330
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

625
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,420
<font color="yellow">You can talk to me any time you want.</font>

626
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,800
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  All right.</font>

627
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,570
<font color="yellow">Who is it at this hour?</font>

628
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,200
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm awake now.</font>

629
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,170
<font color="yellow">Who...</font>

630
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,400
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

631
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,830
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Hold on.</font>

632
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,900
<font color="yellow">I'm a family of the owner.</font>

633
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you lying?</font>

634
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,070
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, there's someone here!</font>

635
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,870
<font color="yellow">Hold on, hold on.</font>

636
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,150
<font color="yellow">Hold on, I'm...</font>

637
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,760
<font color="yellow">I'm the landlord's brother-in-law.</font>

638
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,190
<font color="yellow">Why don't we go in and check?</font>

639
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,890
<font color="yellow">Ko... Ko Sang Sik!</font>

640
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:46,990
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

641
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,360
<font color="yellow">- Please, hold on.
-  My goodness.</font>

642
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,270
<font color="yellow">Please quiet down.</font>

643
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,540
<font color="yellow">- Hey, neighbour. It's you...
-  Dad.</font>

644
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,130
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

645
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,690
<font color="yellow">I should have told you in advance.</font>

646
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry we surprised you.</font>

647
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,270
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to die.</font>

648
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,680
<font color="yellow">It's just for tonight. Just tonight.</font>

649
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,350
<font color="yellow">They'll find out everything by tomorrow morning.</font>

650
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,670
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what's going on.</font>

651
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,980
<font color="yellow">What are you doing at this hour?</font>

652
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,330
<font color="yellow">As long as we set up the tent, Sang Sik won't kick us out.</font>

653
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,700
<font color="yellow">Tent?</font>

654
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,630
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no.
-  I told you to be careful.</font>

655
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,370
<font color="yellow">Don't you know?</font>

656
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,490
<font color="yellow">Do we have to live like this every summer?</font>

657
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,650
<font color="yellow">All of my friends go abroad on trips...</font>

658
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,400
<font color="yellow">and vacations.</font>

659
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,830
<font color="yellow">We always rent out our place for money.</font>

660
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,560
<font color="yellow">Hoon, keep it down. It's just for 15 days.</font>

661
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,890
<font color="yellow">Just think positively and consider it as making memories.</font>

662
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,250
<font color="yellow">All right, enough nagging.</font>

663
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,220
<font color="yellow">Prepare the blankets. I'm sleepy.</font>

664
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,540
<font color="yellow">- I'm tired, too.
-  Okay, okay.</font>

665
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,670
<font color="yellow">These mosquitoes.</font>

666
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,130
<font color="yellow">Where's the spray?</font>

667
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,800
<font color="yellow">Min Joo.</font>

668
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,230
<font color="yellow">Hey, Min Joo.</font>

669
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,390
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to wake you. I packed so much stuff,</font>

670
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,670
<font color="yellow">but I forgot to pack the insect repellent. Do you have one?</font>

671
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,040
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Have a good night.</font>

672
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,000
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

673
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,540
<font color="yellow">Ma'am?</font>

674
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,130
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

675
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,070
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Park Hoon.</font>

676
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,370
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but could we borrow a bottle of water?</font>

677
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,970
<font color="yellow">I won't ever forget this.</font>

678
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,000
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

679
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,230
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

680
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,870
<font color="yellow">I had too much water.</font>

681
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,900
<font color="yellow">It's urgent. Can I use your washroom?</font>

682
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

683
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,000
<font color="yellow">Ko Sang Hee.</font>

684
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,700
<font color="yellow">Ko Sang Hee.</font>

685
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,200
<font color="yellow">Ko Sang Hee!</font>

686
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,430
<font color="yellow">What are you...</font>

687
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,500
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, my back.
-  What is this?</font>

688
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,600
<font color="yellow">Why are you guys coming out from there?</font>

689
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,860
<font color="yellow">Well the thing is, last night...</font>

690
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,190
<font color="yellow">We were going back and forth, then...</font>

691
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,890
<font color="yellow">She told us to just sleep there.</font>

692
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,930
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

693
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,900
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

694
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,400
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep out here?</font>

695
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,270
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell?</font>

696
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,290
<font color="yellow">Did you let them sleep in your house?</font>

697
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,950
<font color="yellow">Yes, it turned out that way.</font>

698
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,680
<font color="yellow">Why would you do such a thing?</font>

699
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,000
<font color="yellow">Last night...</font>

700
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,770
<font color="yellow">I had no other choice.</font>

701
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,400
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, don't yell at her.</font>

702
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,580
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

703
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,600
<font color="yellow">- Take care.
-  Wait.</font>

704
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,560
<font color="yellow">Since you let us sleep at your place, come have breakfast.</font>

705
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,800
<font color="yellow">I'm all right.</font>

706
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,090
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to sleep at all.</font>

707
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,270
<font color="yellow">Everybody, come follow me.</font>

708
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,670
<font color="yellow">Right now.</font>

709
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,080
<font color="yellow">See? He told all of us to come in.</font>

710
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,110
<font color="yellow">Yes. Let's go inside for now.</font>

711
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,290
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

712
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,570
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
-  Gosh.</font>

713
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,700
<font color="yellow">This is awkward.</font>

714
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,900
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

715
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,900
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the food.
-  In any case,</font>

716
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you because of my family.</font>

717
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,200
<font color="yellow">Yes. I moved here to get a peace of mind.</font>

718
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,230
<font color="yellow">This is your whole family, right?</font>

719
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,340
<font color="yellow">I guess so, but I'm not sure.</font>

720
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,870
<font color="yellow">Who knows when one might pop out of nowhere?</font>

721
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,570
<font color="yellow">Come on, Sang Sik.</font>

722
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,020
<font color="yellow">That's it. This is all of us.</font>

723
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,590
<font color="yellow">Take your tent away after you finish breakfast.</font>

724
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,700
<font color="yellow">I have to go to work.</font>

725
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,490
<font color="yellow">My friends are staying for just a week.</font>

726
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,390
<font color="yellow">Can't you be understanding? I'm trying to make money.</font>

727
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,090
<font color="yellow">Accommodation is expensive during summer vacation,</font>

728
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,020
<font color="yellow">and they've been looking forward to this all year.</font>

729
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,790
<font color="yellow">That's no reason to cause inconvenience to our neighbour.</font>

730
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,100
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

731
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,920
<font color="yellow">I knew we'd be kicked out this summer.</font>

732
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,000
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
-  Hoon.</font>

733
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,380
<font color="yellow">It's not a big deal. We're neighbours.</font>

734
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,470
<font color="yellow">Right, Mi Rae?</font>

735
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:47,970
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry?</font>

736
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me?</font>

737
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,870
<font color="yellow">Right. Mi Rae might get a job at a broadcasting company.</font>

738
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,380
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

739
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,400
<font color="yellow">Is this true, Mi Rae?</font>

740
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,960
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

741
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,970
<font color="yellow">No. I haven't decided yet.</font>

742
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,900
<font color="yellow">What is this about?</font>

743
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,360
<font color="yellow">I gave Mi Rae an offer.</font>

744
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,800
<font color="yellow">I asked her to work with me at our company.</font>

745
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,070
<font color="yellow">I'm against it.</font>

746
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,870
<font color="yellow">- Why?
-  It's a no.</font>

747
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,930
<font color="yellow">You'll only get hurt while working at a place like that.</font>

748
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,670
<font color="yellow">"A place like that"?</font>

749
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,590
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say about my work?</font>

750
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,830
<font color="yellow">All they care about are ratings and commercials.</font>

751
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,670
<font color="yellow">It's the most commercial-focused job in this capitalist society.</font>

752
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,520
<font color="yellow">For someone like Mi Rae who focuses only on creativity,</font>

753
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,800
<font color="yellow">it's a place she could get hurt.</font>

754
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,320
<font color="yellow">On what grounds are you saying this?</font>

755
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,640
<font color="yellow">My family...</font>

756
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,880
<font color="yellow">isn't interested in television shows nor dramas.</font>

757
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,500
<font color="yellow">Well, I love it.</font>

758
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,410
<font color="yellow">The thing is,</font>

759
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,320
<font color="yellow">if you don't watch it you kind of forget about it.</font>

760
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,530
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that right, Honey?
-  That's right.</font>

761
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,660
<font color="yellow">Of course. Our family don't watch dramas at all.</font>

762
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,990
<font color="yellow">I watch the news, Hoon watches games,</font>

763
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,810
<font color="yellow">and my wife watches the shopping channel.</font>

764
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,400
<font color="yellow">She's addicted.</font>

765
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,930
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault.</font>

766
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:05,970
<font color="yellow">Come on, we're having a meal with our neighbour.</font>

767
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,540
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we talk about food, hobbies or ideal types?</font>

768
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,630
<font color="yellow">Ideal types?</font>

769
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,120
<font color="yellow">I'm fine as long as it's not...</font>

770
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,700
<font color="yellow">a civil servant who has no idea what his family is thinking...</font>

771
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,240
<font color="yellow">and is stuck up and stubborn.</font>

772
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,690
<font color="yellow">Same goes for me. I hate women that lived alone for a long time...</font>

773
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,700
<font color="yellow">and only cares about herself.</font>

774
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I'll excuse myself.</font>

775
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,060
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you guys?</font>

776
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,510
<font color="yellow">- Don't leave like that.
-  No, sit down.</font>

777
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,600
<font color="yellow">Sit down and eat.</font>

778
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,100
<font color="yellow">How can he talk bad about my job after I let his family...</font>

779
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,470
<font color="yellow">sleep in my house?</font>

780
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,190
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

781
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,930
<font color="yellow">We obsess over ratings? We're capitalistic?</font>

782
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,330
<font color="yellow">My stomach hurts.</font>

783
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,130
<font color="yellow">Why do I suddenly feel...</font>

784
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,630
<font color="yellow">I'm so stressed.</font>

785
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,230
<font color="yellow">What on earth happened?</font>

786
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,030
<font color="yellow">Come on, tell us now.</font>

787
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,770
<font color="yellow">- Goodness.
-  Goodness.</font>

788
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,500
<font color="yellow">You know,</font>

789
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:27,030
<font color="yellow">my period started. Thankfully,</font>

790
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,830
<font color="yellow">it wasn't menopause. My period was just irregular.</font>

791
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,700
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

792
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,900
<font color="yellow">Bravo.</font>

793
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,310
<font color="yellow">See? I told you to get a checkup.</font>

794
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,030
<font color="yellow">Between menopause and an irregular period,</font>

795
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,200
<font color="yellow">did you switch from being a person to a woman?</font>

796
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,630
<font color="yellow">To congratulate you on becoming a woman again,</font>

797
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,630
<font color="yellow">let's cheer.</font>

798
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,630
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

799
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,150
<font color="yellow">- It's all because of skateboarding.
-  Skateboarding?</font>

800
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,060
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo taught me how to skateboard.</font>

801
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,420
<font color="yellow">Have you asked him...</font>

802
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,130
<font color="yellow">about the woman I saw last time?</font>

803
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,010
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why are you jinxing a couple that's doing well?</font>

804
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,220
<font color="yellow">He must have lent some money to her.</font>

805
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,020
<font color="yellow">It didn't look like that.</font>

806
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,560
<font color="yellow">How can I ask him directly? I'm not his girlfriend.</font>

807
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,020
<font color="yellow">Didn't he count that day as your first day of dating?</font>

808
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,700
<font color="yellow">You're slow-witted and old-fashioned because you can't even...</font>

809
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,120
<font color="yellow">understand that.</font>

810
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,590
<font color="yellow">That's right. I'm old-fashioned who's losing her senses.</font>

811
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,570
<font color="yellow">I'm already treated as an old lady.</font>

812
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,230
<font color="yellow">What's wrong now?</font>

813
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,070
<font color="yellow">If you get a project with Woori City,</font>

814
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,570
<font color="yellow">it won't be that hard for us to escape from this place.</font>

815
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,800
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about not having a writer to work with?</font>

816
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,330
<font color="yellow">We have Ae Ri.</font>

817
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,270
<font color="yellow">Are you going to work with her?</font>

818
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,970
<font color="yellow">There's one more, but I'll have to meet her. Before that...</font>

819
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,330
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

820
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,800
<font color="yellow">Since we don't have a good writer,</font>

821
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,660
<font color="yellow">we need a good actress.</font>

822
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,830
<font color="yellow">Which actress? Everyone's scheduled for their next drama.</font>

823
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,430
<font color="yellow">Joo Yeon.</font>

824
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,810
<font color="yellow">Do you mean Na Joo Yeon?</font>

825
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, why not?</font>

826
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:10,290
<font color="yellow">Come on. She'd never do it.</font>

827
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,230
<font color="yellow">She'll be loyal at least.</font>

828
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,370
<font color="yellow">Cut. Let's take a break.</font>

829
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,600
<font color="yellow">Bring me my phone.</font>

830
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Producer Kang.</font>

831
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,590
<font color="yellow">Goodness, have you been well?</font>

832
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,830
<font color="yellow">I'm always the same.</font>

833
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,490
<font color="yellow">You must be popular. You're dominating all the commercials.</font>

834
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,980
<font color="yellow">No, it's tiring because young ones are getting competitive.</font>

835
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,770
<font color="yellow">You're still unrivalled.</font>

836
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,070
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

837
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,500
<font color="yellow">It's okay. You should sit.</font>

838
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,300
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

839
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,050
<font color="yellow">What brings you all the way here?</font>

840
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,070
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

841
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,670
<font color="yellow">You see, there's this drama...</font>

842
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,650
<font color="yellow">that I'm producing.</font>

843
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,030
<font color="yellow">I have to tell you more about it.</font>

844
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,700
<font color="yellow">When are you free?</font>

845
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,200
<font color="yellow">Did you wait until now just to tell me that?</font>

846
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,780
<font color="yellow">You should have called.</font>

847
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,300
<font color="yellow">I did, but you didn't answer.</font>

848
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,770
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

849
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,670
<font color="yellow">I didn't know because I don't have your number saved.</font>

850
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,900
<font color="yellow">Is this about the Woori City drama?</font>

851
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,530
<font color="yellow">How did you know? Did someone else call you?</font>

852
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,300
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

853
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,830
<font color="yellow">Many people called me to try and win something hard to get.</font>

854
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,830
<font color="yellow">So are you considering it at all?</font>

855
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,130
<font color="yellow">I'd consider it based on our friendship,</font>

856
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,470
<font color="yellow">but you should consider your age.</font>

857
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,630
<font color="yellow">It needs to include current trends,</font>

858
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,530
<font color="yellow">but if you produce it, do you think anyone would select it?</font>

859
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:08,330
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I'm still fine.</font>

860
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,780
<font color="yellow">That was during your prime.</font>

861
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not the Joo Yeon...</font>

862
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,500
<font color="yellow">who used to cry for being scolded for my bad acting.</font>

863
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,330
<font color="yellow">Shooting dramas is exhausting,</font>

864
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,700
<font color="yellow">so I want to focus on movies.</font>

865
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,770
<font color="yellow">You're still a rude brat.</font>

866
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,810
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

867
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,700
<font color="yellow">Do you know why so many dislike you?</font>

868
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,540
<font color="yellow">It's because of that tongue.</font>

869
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,200
<font color="yellow">You can lose your career by saying something wrong in this industry.</font>

870
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,390
<font color="yellow">If you want to continue working,</font>

871
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,130
<font color="yellow">don't think about fixing anything else...</font>

872
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,330
<font color="yellow">but that tongue of yours.</font>

873
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,130
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable.</font>

874
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,970
<font color="yellow">Why did she come here just to make me angry?</font>

875
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,770
<font color="yellow">Move that away from me!</font>

876
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,860
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, everyone.
-  Thank you.</font>

877
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,390
<font color="yellow">You don't know how to move your body.</font>

878
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,690
<font color="yellow">Why can't you do that move?</font>

879
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,360
<font color="yellow">Can't you do this?</font>

880
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,700
<font color="yellow">Do it like this.</font>

881
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,510
<font color="yellow">He's a little old, after all.</font>

882
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,530
<font color="yellow">I'm old?</font>

883
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,120
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

884
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,370
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko was the cutest like a squirrel.</font>

885
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,620
<font color="yellow">I was impressed that you could write songs.</font>

886
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,250
<font color="yellow">That's nothing.</font>

887
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,360
<font color="yellow">Let's rehearse more...</font>

888
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,790
<font color="yellow">and upload it on the homepage or the blog to see how people react.</font>

889
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,000
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Okay.</font>

890
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,270
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

891
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,670
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

892
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it was a difficult decision.</font>

893
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,900
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for coming.</font>

894
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,000
<font color="yellow">No, I'm the one who should thank you.</font>

895
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:50,860
<font color="yellow">Let's talk inside.</font>

896
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,100
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

897
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,630
<font color="yellow">I'd like to make it short and talk here.</font>

898
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,420
<font color="yellow">I thought about it a lot,</font>

899
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,320
<font color="yellow">but I think it's better that I don't do it.</font>

900
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,900
<font color="yellow">If it's because of your brother...</font>

901
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,080
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

902
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,700
<font color="yellow">I don't want to give him a hard time for my sake.</font>

903
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,270
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

904
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,510
<font color="yellow">You should tell me a definite reason...</font>

905
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,530
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

906
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,770
<font color="yellow">my brother had a bad experience with a broadcasting station.</font>

907
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,400
<font color="yellow">A bad experience?</font>

908
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:28,100
<font color="yellow">Well, what I mean is...</font>

909
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,630
<font color="yellow">There was an accident that he doesn't want to remember.</font>

910
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,030
<font color="yellow">Does that mean he opposes you of working...</font>

911
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:43,500
<font color="yellow">because of something that happened a long time ago?</font>

912
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:49,900
<font color="yellow">How frustrating.</font>

913
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,630
<font color="yellow">I told you my decision, so I'll get going.</font>

914
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:54,970
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

915
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,530
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

916
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,120
