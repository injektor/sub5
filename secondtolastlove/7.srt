00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,560
<font color="yellow">Do you have disinfectant at home?
If you don't, I'll bring you some.</font>

2
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,090
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

3
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,690
<font color="yellow">- Where?
-  Just come with me.</font>

4
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,290
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about earlier.</font>

5
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,600
<font color="yellow">I was too harsh on you.</font>

6
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

7
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,600
<font color="yellow">I also mistook myself as a competent and talented person.</font>

8
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,200
<font color="yellow">I only said that because I was upset.</font>

9
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,930
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean it for you to blame yourself.</font>

10
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,530
<font color="yellow">I'm not. It's the truth.</font>

11
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,360
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm falling behind.</font>

12
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,230
<font color="yellow">People treat me like a has-been.</font>

13
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,730
<font color="yellow">I think the problem with you is that you work too passionately.</font>

14
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,490
<font color="yellow">That's why you keep on falling.</font>

15
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,130
<font color="yellow">Take a break. No one will arrest you.</font>

16
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,560
<font color="yellow">Ask them to give you time off for your leg.</font>

17
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,890
<font color="yellow">What if I really fall behind then?</font>

18
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,640
<font color="yellow">People are making fun of me these days.</font>

19
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,460
<font color="yellow">It's okay to hear that at our age.</font>

20
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,240
<font color="yellow">It's normal.</font>

21
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,200
<font color="yellow">That's why I should try harder.</font>

22
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,480
<font color="yellow">That way, I won't fall.</font>

23
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,440
<font color="yellow">You have to rest well in order to avoid falling.</font>

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,630
<font color="yellow">Don't try to run. Just walk.</font>

25
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,590
<font color="yellow">I'll try.</font>

26
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,030
<font color="yellow">Actually, I've been practising something with my staff.</font>

27
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,560
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one that keeps getting it wrong.</font>

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,790
<font color="yellow">They call me old-fashioned.</font>

29
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,010
<font color="yellow">What are you practising?</font>

30
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,490
<font color="yellow">We're trying to promote the city.</font>

31
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,530
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be singing and dancing.</font>

32
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,840
<font color="yellow">I know how well you can dance. I saw that at the concert.</font>

33
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,490
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing that up?</font>

34
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,630
<font color="yellow">I wish I could see what you practised.</font>

35
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,030
<font color="yellow">Do you have drinks instead of coffee?</font>

36
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,990
<font color="yellow">I think you drank enough already.</font>

37
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,060
<font color="yellow">It won't change much even if I drink more.</font>

38
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,290
<font color="yellow">What kind of music do you like?</font>

39
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,060
<font color="yellow">I like anything old.</font>

40
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,630
<font color="yellow">You're like a DJ.</font>

41
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,230
<font color="yellow">There are so many films, too.</font>

42
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,290
<font color="yellow">With this many albums, I wonder what you did before.</font>

43
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,630
<font color="yellow">Did you have a different job?</font>

44
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,060
<font color="yellow">It's just a hobby.</font>

45
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,790
<font color="yellow">You should go home and sleep.</font>

46
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,260
<font color="yellow">I'll go when I finish what you gave me.</font>

47
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,130
<font color="yellow">About the garden,</font>

48
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,050
<font color="yellow">I did what you told me to with the vinegar water,</font>

49
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,870
<font color="yellow">but the leaves turned white and it looks worse.</font>

50
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,160
<font color="yellow">I sprayed some more, but it turned even more white.</font>

51
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,030
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

52
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,970
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me in advance?</font>

53
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,830
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you now.</font>

54
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,340
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Dad.</font>

55
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,090
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, but he'll think it's a big deal if he hears it from you.</font>

56
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,290
<font color="yellow">What will you do for me then?</font>

57
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,850
<font color="yellow">You have to tell me right away next time.</font>

58
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,090
<font color="yellow">Don't try to decide on your own.</font>

59
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,230
<font color="yellow">That's the right way to raise one.</font>

60
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,020
<font color="yellow">All right, I will.</font>

61
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,590
<font color="yellow">I asked her to keep it a secret.</font>

62
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,690
<font color="yellow">How can she tell him already?</font>

<font color="yellow">- Hey, Sang Sik.
-  Where are you going?</font>

70
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,410
<font color="yellow">Min Joo's place. She seemed to be upset yesterday.</font>

71
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,130
<font color="yellow">I thought maybe we could go for a walk together.</font>

72

<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

73
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,660
<font color="yellow">She's probably sleeping in. Just let her be.</font>

74
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,060
<font color="yellow">She's sleeping? How do you know?</font>

75
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,780
<font color="yellow">It's still early. How can she be up already?</font>

76
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,700
<font color="yellow">You said something happened yesterday, right?</font>

77
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,090
<font color="yellow">She could have had some drinks.</font>

78
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,730
<font color="yellow">Do you think so? I'll give her a call.</font>

79
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,730
<font color="yellow">A call?</font>

80
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,030
<font color="yellow">The number you have called...</font>

81
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,790
<font color="yellow">She's not picking up.</font>

82
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,800
<font color="yellow">Maybe she's sleeping.</font>

83
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,850
<font color="yellow">Right. You should go on your own.</font>

84
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,750
<font color="yellow">I better do that. Do you want to come?</font>

85
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,730
<font color="yellow">No. I'm feeling a bit sore.</font>

86
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,110
<font color="yellow">Go and come back fast. We'll have breakfast.</font>

87
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,430
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  All right.</font>

88
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,530
<font color="yellow">Why did I...</font>

89
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,030
<font color="yellow">I must be crazy.</font>

90
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,260
<font color="yellow">- I...
-  Hello.</font>

91
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,090
<font color="yellow">- Did you sleep well?
-  Why didn't you wake me?</font>

92
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,530
<font color="yellow">You were sleeping so soundly.</font>

93
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,130
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened, right?</font>

94
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,960
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

95
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,930
<font color="yellow">You're sure?</font>

96
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,190
<font color="yellow">Well, I was drunk, so I don't remember anything.</font>

97
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,060
<font color="yellow">I'm glad. Bye.</font>

98
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,050
<font color="yellow">You should be careful.</font>

99
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,330
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Bye.</font>

100
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,500
<font color="yellow">Glad? She's glad?</font>

101
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,430
<font color="yellow">I think the problem with you is that you work too passionately.</font>

102
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,230
<font color="yellow">That's why you keep on falling.</font>

103
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,370
<font color="yellow">You have to rest well in order to avoid falling.</font>

104

<font color="yellow">Don't try to run. Just walk.</font>

105
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,290
<font color="yellow">He seems like a good guy...</font>

106
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,890
<font color="yellow">the more I see him.</font>

107
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,390
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. I'll set it.</font>

108
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,830
<font color="yellow">You guys, too!</font>

109
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,960
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Okay.</font>

110
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,060
<font color="yellow">Don't any of you have manners?</font>

111
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,410
<font color="yellow">I told you, we should make eye contact during meals.</font>

112
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,710
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Kids are like that these days.</font>

113
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,330
<font color="yellow">We can't compare to when our parents were alive.</font>

114
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,890
<font color="yellow">I was looking at textbooks.</font>

115
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,230
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you studied at the library until late yesterday?</font>

116
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,080
<font color="yellow">Well, there's no end to learning.</font>

117
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,930
<font color="yellow">What's the point of starting then?</font>

118
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,960
<font color="yellow">Of course, it's hard for you to understand since you never started.</font>

119
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,350
<font color="yellow">I prepared something special for Ye Ji...</font>

120
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,730
<font color="yellow">since she studies so hard.</font>

121
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,010
<font color="yellow">Amazing. I'll only eat this since I'm on a diet.</font>

122
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,030
<font color="yellow">Diet? For who?</font>

123
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,260
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

124
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,880
<font color="yellow">- Eat.
-  Good morning.</font>

125
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,570
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Sang Sik.</font>

126
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,240
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and sit down. Get ready faster tomorrow.</font>

127
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,030
<font color="yellow">You weren't at the library.</font>

128
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,490
<font color="yellow">Where were you?</font>

129
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,690
<font color="yellow">I was with Hyun Seok.</font>

130
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,720
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you where you were and what you did with him.</font>

131
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,850
<font color="yellow">It was our 50th day, so we ate with our friends and talked.</font>

132
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,410
<font color="yellow">50 days? What is that?</font>

133
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,210
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik. It's a thing these days.</font>

134
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,350
<font color="yellow">You guys dated for 50 days already?</font>

135
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,640
<font color="yellow">Bring him home. I want to see him.</font>

136
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,390
<font color="yellow">You dated him for 50 days?</font>

137
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,150
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie to me?</font>

138
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,630
<font color="yellow">How can I ever talk to you about anything?</font>

139
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,160
<font color="yellow">Especially about Hyun Seok.</font>

140
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,000
<font color="yellow">You haven't dated in so long. You wouldn't understand.</font>

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,130
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

142
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,600
<font color="yellow">- I wouldn't understand?
-  No!</font>

143
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,140
<font color="yellow">Well, I haven't dated in a while either.</font>

144
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,130
<font color="yellow">Maybe it runs in the genes.</font>

145
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,770
<font color="yellow">Why did you give them such bad genes?</font>

146
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,830
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

147
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,640
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

148
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,290
<font color="yellow">Also, get rid of that tent outside.</font>

149
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,930
<font color="yellow">You're not homeless. Why would you put up a tent...</font>

150
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji.</font>

151
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,420
<font color="yellow">You better watch your actions. Understand?</font>

152
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,430
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

153
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,520
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

154
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,870
<font color="yellow">Jeong Sik is doing a drama project for the city?</font>

155
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,650
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the proposal about bringing in new writers?</font>

156
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,500
<font color="yellow">The one we all voted for.</font>

157
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,330
<font color="yellow">Yes. You guys voted against me, and I was embarrassed.</font>

158
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,680
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I think they're preparing with that proposal.</font>

159
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,630
<font color="yellow">Why would Director Gook ask me and ask Jeong Sik, as well?</font>

160
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean. It's weird.</font>

161
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,160
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your leg?</font>

162
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,290
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt?</font>

163
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,090
<font color="yellow">I fell.</font>

164
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,860
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

165
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
<font color="yellow">- Anyway, I'll be there soon.
-  Producer Kang.</font>

166
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,330
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang?</font>

167
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,560
<font color="yellow">What's happening?</font>

168
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,430
<font color="yellow">Is it broken again?</font>

169
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,960
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

170
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,890
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't understand?</font>

171
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,230
<font color="yellow">And she's been dating for 50 days?</font>

172
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,890
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

173
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, Writer Hwang.</font>

174
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,430
<font color="yellow">Thanks for considering me, but I should work on my own now.</font>

175
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,260
<font color="yellow">I decided not to go to the broadcasting company.</font>

176
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,290
<font color="yellow">It's because of family reasons.</font>

177
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,430
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a good opportunity. I want to do it, as well.</font>

178
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,290
<font color="yellow">But it just turned out that way.</font>

179
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,290
<font color="yellow">I'm sure another huge chance will come in my life.</font>

180
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,780
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae, can you come down and help me?</font>

181
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,990
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

182
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,130
<font color="yellow">I'll call you back later. Bye.</font>

183
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,410
<font color="yellow">When I was young, I thought...</font>

184
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,530
<font color="yellow">you would know how to do everything once you become an adult.</font>

185
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,760
<font color="yellow">However, now that I'm an adult,</font>

186
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,130
<font color="yellow">I realised that nothing will happen...</font>

187
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,130
<font color="yellow">unless you take action for yourself.</font>

188
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,330
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae even came to see me at work.</font>

189
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,630
<font color="yellow">She's interested,</font>

190
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,230
<font color="yellow">but she can't accept the job because of you.</font>

191
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened in the past,</font>

192
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,130
<font color="yellow">but it's making you tie down your family.</font>

193
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,530
<font color="yellow">You didn't leave yet?</font>

194
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,430
<font color="yellow">No. I'm leaving now.</font>

195
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming down from there?</font>

196
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,600
<font color="yellow">I went to Ye Ji's room.</font>

197
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,630
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

198
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,730
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

199
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,760
<font color="yellow">Do you want to try that job?</font>

200
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,940
<font color="yellow">What job?</font>

201
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,560
<font color="yellow">The offer from our neighbour.</font>

202
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,330
<font color="yellow">Do you want to do it?</font>

203
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,960
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not going to do it.</font>

204
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,260
<font color="yellow">I can tell that you want to.</font>

205
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,590
<font color="yellow">I said, I'm not doing it.</font>

206
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested. I told you.</font>

207
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,530
<font color="yellow">I hope you earn a lot of money by going through all this.</font>

208
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,060
<font color="yellow">Hoon has no future here.</font>

209
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,340
<font color="yellow">I better send him to China to study next year.</font>

210
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,670
<font color="yellow">I already told you. Studying is not his thing.</font>

211
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,420
<font color="yellow">His dad's blood still runs in him.</font>

212
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,560
<font color="yellow">Yours, as well.</font>

213
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,480
<font color="yellow">While we're on that...</font>

214
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,250
<font color="yellow">You never got a loan from work, have you?</font>

215
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,130
<font color="yellow">- I'll give you interest if you...
-  Are you still sleeping?</font>

216
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,390
<font color="yellow">Wake up. Wake up.</font>

217
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,910
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Ye Ji.</font>

218
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,060
<font color="yellow">It's normal to have a boyfriend at that age.</font>

219
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,310
<font color="yellow">We should let Mi Rae go, as well.</font>

220
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,180
<font color="yellow">She's 35, and all she does is draw alone at home. She'll die a virgin.</font>

221
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,890
<font color="yellow">She needs to have a social life.</font>

222
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,160
<font color="yellow">Even if it's tough, she needs to work with others.</font>

223
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,360
<font color="yellow">It'll be fine.</font>

224
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,260
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work.</font>

225
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,800
<font color="yellow">I'll make kongguksu for dinner tonight.</font>

226
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,060
<font color="yellow">I make it better than Mum!</font>

227
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,360
<font color="yellow">Your knee hurts. Why are you wearing heels?</font>

228
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,260
<font color="yellow">Thanks for your concern,</font>

229
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,960
<font color="yellow">but someone like you...</font>

230
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,860
<font color="yellow">wouldn't understand women.</font>

231
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,230
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

232
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,210
<font color="yellow">Regarding Mi Rae...</font>

233
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,350
<font color="yellow">If it's about her, let's forget it. I'll consider it never happened.</font>

234
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,490
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

235
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,200
<font color="yellow">I was hoping to ask you to look after her.</font>

236
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,430
<font color="yellow">If you're still open to working with her, that is.</font>

237
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,660
<font color="yellow">Then tell her to come out right now.</font>

238
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,200
<font color="yellow">May I?</font>

239
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,880
<font color="yellow">I can't guarantee if we'll work together for long,</font>

240
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,200
<font color="yellow">but it's important to give it a try.</font>

241
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,790
<font color="yellow">You should still wear runners.</font>

242
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,520
<font color="yellow">You keep changing your mind about everything.</font>

243
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,130
<font color="yellow">Don't go back on your word again.</font>

244
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,890
<font color="yellow">I won't. I'll send her over.</font>

245
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,590
<font color="yellow">Joo Yeon, as long as you sign with me,</font>

246
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,730
<font color="yellow">I'm certain I can get this rolling.</font>

247
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,040
<font color="yellow">You've seen the character, right?</font>

248
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,860
<font color="yellow">If you use this chance to change your image,</font>

249
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,130
<font color="yellow">it'll only be a matter of time before you go to Hollywood.</font>

250
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,430
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll send in my agent.</font>

251
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,490
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang.</font>

252
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,060
<font color="yellow">- What is this?
-  What do you think?</font>

253
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,990
<font color="yellow">It's the script you threw out like garbage when everyone else liked it.</font>

254
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,960
<font color="yellow">Are you sending her to Hollywood...</font>

255
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,090
<font color="yellow">and kicking me out of work?</font>

256
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,370
<font color="yellow">How can the both of you stab my back like this?</font>

257
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,030
<font color="yellow">I guess there really is no loyalty in this industry.</font>

258
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,580
<font color="yellow">This is why I said we should meet outside.</font>

259
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,750
<font color="yellow">I'm not scared of her.</font>

260
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,160
<font color="yellow">Anyway, sign it. Okay?</font>

261
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,200
<font color="yellow">What happened to your leg?</font>

262
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,830
<font color="yellow">("Oh Hae Jin, The Love Psychologist")</font>

263
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,260
<font color="yellow">"Woori City drama"?</font>

264
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,000
<font color="yellow">Director Gook.</font>

265
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,700
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

266
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,700
<font color="yellow">Am I a spare?</font>

267
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,330
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

268
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,230
<font color="yellow">That's impossible for the great Kang Min Joo.</font>

269
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,040
<font color="yellow">We're not a car repair shop.</font>

270
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,800
<font color="yellow">If anything, I'm the spare. Isn't that right, Director Gook?</font>

271
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,960
<font color="yellow">Well the thing is...</font>

272
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,100
<font color="yellow">- I...
-  Don't you trust me any more?</font>

273
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,080
<font color="yellow">Did you think I wouldn't be able get the city drama project?</font>

274
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,680
<font color="yellow">Is that why you ordered Jeong Sik to do the same thing?</font>

275
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,920
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

276
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,390
<font color="yellow">- Have some water.
-  Yes.</font>

277
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,040
<font color="yellow">I didn't even start,</font>

278
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,870
<font color="yellow">but all the writers declined already.</font>

279
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,220
<font color="yellow">Even top stars I discovered and supported declined my offer.</font>

280
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,870
<font color="yellow">I was declined by everyone!</font>

281
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,430
<font color="yellow">Really? You...</font>

282
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,830
<font color="yellow">Director Gook.</font>

283
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,960
<font color="yellow">I know that recently,</font>

284
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,200
<font color="yellow">some of the ideas I threw out were made...</font>

285
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,530
<font color="yellow">into dramas at other channels and were very popular.</font>

286
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,530
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

287
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,250
<font color="yellow">Ever since I started working here,</font>

288
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,420
<font color="yellow">my dramas were always rated the best.</font>

289
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,150
<font color="yellow">I would get so many commercials and get 30 to 40 percent ratings.</font>

290
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,930
<font color="yellow">I can't just die like this. I won't allow it.</font>

291
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,660
<font color="yellow">I know you won't.</font>

292
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,540
<font color="yellow">You're still good, so don't worry.</font>

293
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,310
<font color="yellow">I'm not doing this because I don't trust you.</font>

294
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,210
<font color="yellow">To be honest, what if we really don't get this project?</font>

295
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,480
<font color="yellow">Our company's name is on the line.</font>

296
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,860
<font color="yellow">I'll succeed no matter what.</font>

297
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,360
<font color="yellow">I'll show everyone that's talking behind my back.</font>

298
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,030
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get this project no matter what.</font>

299
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,500
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko, you're a lot better now.</font>

300
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,330
<font color="yellow">I agree. Did you practise by yourself at home?</font>

301
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,560
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko, why isn't the drama project led by our department?</font>

302
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,660
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko went through so much trouble the last time...</font>

303
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,570
<font color="yellow">we helped out with a drama.</font>

304
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,650
<font color="yellow">Still, the drama can make Woori City known globally.</font>

305
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,650
<font color="yellow">I think that broadcasting companies are competing to get the project.</font>

306
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,140
<font color="yellow">It's become a huge project.</font>

307
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,430
<font color="yellow">We're busy with other projects.</font>

308
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,270
<font color="yellow">We're in the local tourism department.</font>

309
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,480
<font color="yellow">We should be the ones working on that project.</font>

310
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,430
<font color="yellow">Song Yi, isn't it because you want to see celebrities?</font>

311
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,660
<font color="yellow">That can definitely be considered as sexual harassment in the workplace.</font>

312
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,360
<font color="yellow">Sexual harassment?</font>

313
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,030
<font color="yellow">(We're looking for part-time helpers who are interested in cooking.)</font>

314
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,430
<font color="yellow">(Comma)</font>

315
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,790
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

316
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,030
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo. Jun Woo.</font>

317
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,510
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Jun Woo.
-  Did you order nakji bibimbab?</font>

318
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,560
<font color="yellow">- Look over there.
-  Yes.</font>

319
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,860
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter?
-  It seemed delicious.</font>

320
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,310
<font color="yellow">We use kidney beans instead of sausage.</font>

321
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,720
<font color="yellow">Also, the tofu scramble replaces scrambled eggs,</font>

322
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,170
<font color="yellow">which enhances the texture and compliments the broccoli inside.</font>

323
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,360
<font color="yellow">Then what about this one?</font>

324
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,920
<font color="yellow">That one is raw zucchini noodle pasta.</font>

325
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,200
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

326
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Just leave her be for now.</font>

327
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,770
<font color="yellow">The noodles are made of zucchini, which is like Italian squash.</font>

328
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,320
<font color="yellow">It may look like a salad,</font>

329
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,130
<font color="yellow">but it's actually very filling and keeps you satiated for long.</font>

330
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,730
<font color="yellow">- Oh, really?
-  It looks nice.</font>

331
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,030
<font color="yellow">Hey, Sang Sik.</font>

332
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,760
<font color="yellow">I came to Jun Woo's cafe to help him out with the lunch crowd.</font>

333
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,330
<font color="yellow">What? The broadcasting station?</font>

334
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,190
<font color="yellow">Now?</font>

335
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,230
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what am I doing right now?</font>

336
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,390
<font color="yellow">I must be out of my mind.</font>

337
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,350
<font color="yellow">What happened? Is my sister-in-law okay?</font>

338
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,630
<font color="yellow">She's getting surgery now. Please wait a little bit.</font>

339
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,830
<font color="yellow">Sang Hee, what should we do? What's taking Sang Sik so long?</font>

340
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,690
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo, you're here.</font>

341
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,160
<font color="yellow">Where's Sang Sik? Is he not here yet?</font>

342
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,590
<font color="yellow">What's going on? What happened?</font>

343
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,690
<font color="yellow">- Sang Sik, please.
-  Let go of me!</font>

344
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,890
<font color="yellow">- Sang Sik.
-  Sang Sik.</font>

345
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,120
<font color="yellow">Why are you dressed like that?</font>

346
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,490
<font color="yellow">You should've put on something more proper.</font>

347
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,690
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this?</font>

348
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,630
<font color="yellow">You can do a good job, right?</font>

349
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,330
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.</font>

350
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,990
<font color="yellow">I don't think what I'm doing is right.</font>

351
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,790
<font color="yellow">Let me say this again.</font>

352
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,660
<font color="yellow">Don't give up on your dream because of me.</font>

353
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,990
<font color="yellow">Do your very best at whatever you want to do.</font>

354
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,710
<font color="yellow">Are you going on vacation or what? Why did you bring so much stuff?</font>

355
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,830
<font color="yellow">I need everything I brought today.</font>

356
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,190
<font color="yellow">You're so quirky.</font>

357
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,160
<font color="yellow">I could've taken the bus alone.</font>

358
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,560
<font color="yellow">Call me if anything goes wrong, and take care of yourself.</font>

359
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,420
<font color="yellow">Am I enlisting myself in the army? I'm not a kid.</font>

360
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,630
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and get going now.</font>

361
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,630
<font color="yellow">- Ko Sang Sik?
-  All right. Go in.</font>

362
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,430
<font color="yellow">Best of luck.</font>

363
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,160
<font color="yellow">Why does Chief Ko get disgusted every time he just hears "drama"?</font>

364
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,710
<font color="yellow">I know, right? It's almost as if he's allergic to the word.</font>

365
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,200
<font color="yellow">He must have some sort of unfavourable memories about dramas.</font>

366
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,230
<font color="yellow">Unfavourable memories?</font>

367
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,330
<font color="yellow">It could have something to do with his ex-wife's death.</font>

368
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,940
<font color="yellow">According to rumours, that's when he became super responsible.</font>

369
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,870
<font color="yellow">I heard he took the civil service exam after she passed away, too.</font>

370
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,290
<font color="yellow">Then what kind of job did he have before that?</font>

371
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,130
<font color="yellow">I asked him, but he didn't tell me.</font>

372
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,930
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what he's trying to hide.</font>

373
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,690
<font color="yellow">They say that you mustn't ask men about their past.</font>

374
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,590
<font color="yellow">What the person is like now...</font>

375
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,390
<font color="yellow">at this moment is what matters.</font>

376
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,670
<font color="yellow">Come in, Mi Rae.</font>

377
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,690
<font color="yellow">Everyone, say hello.</font>

378
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,330
<font color="yellow">She's Ko Mi Rae, the one who wrote "I Don't Love You Even If I Die".</font>

379
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,870
<font color="yellow">Pardon? You mean the web comic that Producer Han plagiarised?</font>

380
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,960
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

381
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,860
<font color="yellow">The one who didn't withdraw the lawsuit and caused you trouble?</font>

382
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,690
<font color="yellow">Gosh, stop it. It's all in the past.</font>

383
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,010
<font color="yellow">All in all, she's the one who made Producer Kang get demoted.</font>

384
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,090
<font color="yellow">You got demoted?</font>

385
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,130
<font color="yellow">Aren't you guys going to greet her?</font>

386
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,880
<font color="yellow">Welcome. I'm Oh Young Ae, and I'm a producing director.</font>

387
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,620
<font color="yellow">I look forward to working with you.</font>

388
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,580
<font color="yellow">I'm inexperienced, so I'll have a lot to learn.</font>

389
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,980
<font color="yellow">Please help me out.</font>

390
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,990
<font color="yellow">I'm waiting for this project to work out...</font>

391
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,930
<font color="yellow">so that I can debut as a director. My name is Nam Ki Cheol.</font>

392
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,150
<font color="yellow">My life depends on the tip of your pen.</font>

393
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,130
<font color="yellow">My life depends on it, too.</font>

394
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,380
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best.</font>

395
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,520
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hello. Welcome to the team.</font>

396
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,730
<font color="yellow">- I'll work hard.
-  Thank you.</font>

397
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,550
<font color="yellow">This is Writer Na Ae Ri.</font>

398
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,980
<font color="yellow">She's written online romance novels.</font>

399
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,250
<font color="yellow">She'll be creating the plot and co-writing the script with you.</font>

400
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,460
<font color="yellow">I see. Hello, Writer Na. I'm honoured to work with you.</font>

401
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,070
<font color="yellow">Are you nervous?</font>

402
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,630
<font color="yellow">You look so frightened right now.</font>

403
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,370
<font color="yellow">Is this your first time visiting a broadcasting station?</font>

404
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,890
<font color="yellow">She is always that rude...</font>

405
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,290
<font color="yellow">and blunt.</font>

406
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,770
<font color="yellow">I see. She's a rude person.</font>

407
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,530
<font color="yellow">That's okay. I don't really care about what other people say.</font>

408
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,570
<font color="yellow">That girl and I are obviously not going to get along.</font>

409
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,780
<font color="yellow">How am I going to write the script with her?</font>

410
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,230
<font color="yellow">I was very worried about having to work with someone like me.</font>

411
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,060
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to know that you're so different from me. Nice to meet you.</font>

412
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,340
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's in your suitcase?</font>

413
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,760
<font color="yellow">Oh, this?</font>

414
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,760
<font color="yellow">All right. I'm ready to work now. Shall we have a meeting, then?</font>

415
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,560
<font color="yellow">- We'll focus on promoting the city.
-  Come in.</font>

416
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

417
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,760
<font color="yellow">In addition...</font>

418
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,560
<font color="yellow">What can I help you with, Chief Ko?</font>

419
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,460
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's nothing.</font>

420
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to interrupt. I'll come back another time.</font>

421
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,330
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

422
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,960
<font color="yellow">Nothing. Don't mind me.</font>

423
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,230
<font color="yellow">Do you know Chief Ko?</font>

424
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,130
<font color="yellow">No. He looks a lot like someone I know,</font>

425
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,490
<font color="yellow">so I mistook him for my acquaintance.</font>

426
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,560
<font color="yellow">Hurry up! Get out of here now!</font>

427
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,430
<font color="yellow">Don't let go of my hand!</font>

428
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,900
<font color="yellow">I trust that you'll make an excellent drama for Woori City.</font>

429
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,030
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

430
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,790
<font color="yellow">Do you know that man, Chief Ko, well?</font>

431
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,490
<font color="yellow">Of course. He and I have a bit of history together.</font>

432
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,090
<font color="yellow">Is that right? You should tell me about it over drinks.</font>

433
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,790
<font color="yellow">Have you and Chief Ko crossed paths in the past?</font>

434
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

435
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,260
<font color="yellow">"Paradise of the Youth".</font>

436
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,890
<font color="yellow">("Paradise of the Youth")</font>

437
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,530
<font color="yellow">Have you watched any dramas?</font>

438
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,760
<font color="yellow">I used to watch dramas all the time when I was younger,</font>

439
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,190
<font color="yellow">but I haven't watched many recently.</font>

440
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,890
<font color="yellow">I think I watched all of Producer Kang's dramas, though.</font>

441
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,090
<font color="yellow">That's probably why. I see elements of romantic comedy throughout this.</font>

442
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,050
<font color="yellow">It's so funny.</font>

443
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,580
<font color="yellow">Really? Let me see.</font>

444
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,740
<font color="yellow">Read it.</font>

445
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,120
<font color="yellow">Then what's your favourite drama of all time?</font>

446
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,060
<font color="yellow">Obviously, it's "Paradise of the Youth"...</font>

447
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,030
<font color="yellow">No, that's not true. I don't have one.</font>

448
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,960
<font color="yellow">"Paradise of the Youth"?</font>

449
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,770
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? It's fine.</font>

450
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,630
<font color="yellow">Producer Han Jeong Sik was the director of the drama.</font>

451
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,510
<font color="yellow">My favourite is Producer Kang's "Story of the Lovers".</font>

452
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:13,070
<font color="yellow">It's my absolute favourite drama of all time.</font>

453
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,740
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's start the meeting.</font>

454
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,860
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

455
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,950
<font color="yellow">I'm totally counting on you.</font>

456
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,660
<font color="yellow">- Seriously.
-  Don't you worry.</font>

457
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,960
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second.</font>

458
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,960
<font color="yellow">You're Ko Sang Sik, right?</font>

459
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,630
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how long has it been? It's so nice to see you.</font>

460
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,390
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

461
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,930
<font color="yellow">I'm here because of the drama about Woori City.</font>

462
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,290
<font color="yellow">You have a great job now. Why didn't you keep in touch with me?</font>

463
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,030
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

464
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,060
<font color="yellow">Good. I've been doing great.</font>

465
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,690
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr Shin and I went to high school together.</font>

466
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,790
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

467
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,630
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko, I didn't know that you used to be a drama producer.</font>

468
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,930
<font color="yellow">He used to be my assistant.</font>

469
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,860
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm happy to see you doing well.</font>

470
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,960
<font color="yellow">Working for the government is the best.</font>

471
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,760
<font color="yellow">It was wise for you to quit. Being a drama producer...</font>

472
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,030
<font color="yellow">at this age is so tough.</font>

473
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,360
<font color="yellow">I'm working on the drama about the city, so help me out.</font>

474
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,300
<font color="yellow">It looks like I'll get to see you often from now on.</font>

475
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,430
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so, Mr Shin?</font>

476
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,060
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

477
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,060
<font color="yellow">Does he think that he's an actor or a Hallyu star?</font>

478
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,190
<font color="yellow">All of his photos are taken with young women.</font>

479
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,660
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

480
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,390
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I'm late.</font>

481
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,230
<font color="yellow">Why did you get up? I'm here now.</font>

482
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,260
<font color="yellow">Iced latte, please.</font>

483
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,890
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

484
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,860
<font color="yellow">Give me my phone.</font>

485
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,540
<font color="yellow">Why are you so impatient?</font>

486
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,070
<font color="yellow">I couldn't get any work done because you took my phone.</font>

487
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,160
<font color="yellow">You must know if you peeked into my phone.</font>

488
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,660
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I turned yours off.</font>

489
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,160
<font color="yellow">I let you answer your calls on my phone. I'm sure it wasn't too bad.</font>

490
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,760
<font color="yellow">Give me my phone now.</font>

491
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,260
<font color="yellow">Goodness gracious, this woman.</font>

492
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,140
<font color="yellow">Here. Take it.</font>

493
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,360
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

494
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,650
<font color="yellow">So are you saying that you still don't know...</font>

495
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,970
<font color="yellow">who I am or what I do?</font>

496
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,880
<font color="yellow">You probably never go out unless you're dressed up from head to toe.</font>

497
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,530
<font color="yellow">If you get a pimple on your face, you must stress about it all day.</font>

498
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,990
<font color="yellow">I can tell what a woman is like at a glance.</font>

499
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,430
<font color="yellow">A woman?</font>

500
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,530
<font color="yellow">I'm a woman, of course. However...</font>

501
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,030
<font color="yellow">You nag a lot, too.</font>

502
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,930
<font color="yellow">You try to put up a tough front, but you feel...</font>

503
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,740
<font color="yellow">empty and lonely.</font>

504
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,990
<font color="yellow">Your life will change dramatically if you could undo just one button.</font>

505
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,530
<font color="yellow">Poor you.</font>

506
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,560
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

507
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,030
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

508
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,960
<font color="yellow">Did that womaniser just turn me down?</font>

509
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,930
<font color="yellow">A woman?</font>

510
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,310
<font color="yellow">We're used to them pestering us while drama shoots are going on.</font>

511
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,660
<font color="yellow">I'll be glad if there are no accidents.</font>

512
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,630
<font color="yellow">The KBN drama, "Paradise of the Youth".</font>

513
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,580
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you're bringing that up again.</font>

514
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,310
<font color="yellow">Rumour says that it wasn't an accident.</font>

515
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,030
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying that it was intentional?</font>

516
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,420
<font color="yellow">It was an accident...</font>

517
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,220
<font color="yellow">where the electrical over-stress on set caused a fire.</font>

518
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,130
<font color="yellow">That's how it was reported in the media, too.</font>

519
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,230
<font color="yellow">We can't fully trust the media.</font>

520
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,650
<font color="yellow">Someone died because of the fire,</font>

521
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,220
<font color="yellow">but no one took responsibility for the accident.</font>

522
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,160
<font color="yellow">- Really?
-  Weren't you the director?</font>

523
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,650
<font color="yellow">I wasn't there when that happened. The production assistant was there.</font>

524
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,430
<font color="yellow">Then was he the person in charge when that happened?</font>

525
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,530
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

526
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,750
<font color="yellow">In the absence of directors,</font>

527
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,220
<font color="yellow">assistants are responsible for everything, so do your job properly.</font>

528
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,230
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Okay.</font>

529
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,790
<font color="yellow">It's not my brother.</font>

530
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,330
<font color="yellow">My brother didn't do it!</font>

531
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,290
<font color="yellow">Boss, where are you going?</font>

532
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,360
<font color="yellow">If it's a delivery, I'll take care of it.</font>

533
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo.</font>

534
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,600
<font color="yellow">Are you stepping out to see that woman?</font>

535
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,190
<font color="yellow">I hope you're not here when I'm back.</font>

536
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,830
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

537
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,490
<font color="yellow">I really mean it.</font>

538
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,830
<font color="yellow">I pestered you and caused trouble because I wanted to see you.</font>

539
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,790
<font color="yellow">I came to Korea because I missed you,</font>

540
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,890
<font color="yellow">but you didn't even want to see me.</font>

541
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,230
<font color="yellow">I acted like that because you kept ignoring me.</font>

542
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,610
<font color="yellow">- I'm really sorry.
-  That's enough.</font>

543
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,260
<font color="yellow">If you like someone, go out with her.</font>

544
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,350
<font color="yellow">If you love someone, go ahead and marry her.</font>

545
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,660
<font color="yellow">Think of me as your friend, please.</font>

546
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,520
<font color="yellow">No. Just think of me as a girl you know.</font>

547
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,660
<font color="yellow">A girl I know?</font>

548
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,960
<font color="yellow">Why is a girl I know apologising to me like this?</font>

549
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,360
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave in a month.</font>

550
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,290
<font color="yellow">I want to apologise for what I did...</font>

551
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,560
<font color="yellow">so that I can move on, too.</font>

552
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,600
<font color="yellow">Help me get over you by letting me stay by your side for now.</font>

553
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,230
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

554
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,160
<font color="yellow">Please let me know if anything happens to Mi Rae.</font>

555
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,660
<font color="yellow">Does he think this is a kindergarten?</font>

556
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,080
<font color="yellow">She works with me in a small office. Nothing bad will happen to her.</font>

557
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,130
<font color="yellow">I assure you that nothing will happen, so please stop worrying.</font>

558
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,380
<font color="yellow">You were here.</font>

559
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,660
<font color="yellow">It looks like you're hurt quite a bit.</font>

560
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,390
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

561
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,080
<font color="yellow">You're not fine. Let me take you to a doctor. How did it happen?</font>

562
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,750
<font color="yellow">I got drunk and fell on the street.</font>

563
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,330
<font color="yellow">It's just scratched and bruised a little.</font>

564
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,260
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang! Are you in there?</font>

565
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm here. What's the matter?</font>

566
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,730
<font color="yellow">- Is Writer Ko there, too?
-  What?</font>

567
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,730
<font color="yellow">No, it's just us here.</font>

568
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,390
<font color="yellow">Writer Ko is gone.</font>

569
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,670
<font color="yellow">We stepped out to get coffee,</font>

570
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,030
<font color="yellow">and she packed up everything and left before we got back.</font>

571
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,830
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

572
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,560
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

573
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know. As far as I know, nothing special happened.</font>

574
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,130
<font color="yellow">She's not answering her phone.</font>

575
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,560
<font color="yellow">Keep calling her.</font>

576
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,320
<font color="yellow">I told you to just stay at the office.</font>

577
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,880
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and just go find her.</font>

578
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,960
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

579
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,530
<font color="yellow">I'm glad. I'll trust you.</font>

580
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,560
<font color="yellow">Have a great day.</font>

581
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

582
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,930
<font color="yellow">Min Joo, can you talk right now?</font>

583
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,360
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way to bring you lunch.</font>

584
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,030
<font color="yellow">I want to surprise Mi Rae, so don't tell her.</font>

585
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,330
<font color="yellow">What if she just grabbed a taxi and took off?</font>

586
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,450
<font color="yellow">She's so quirky.</font>

587
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,930
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure nothing happened?
-  Yes, I'm positive.</font>

588
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,300
<font color="yellow">But why do we have to find someone who ran away?</font>

589
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,360
<font color="yellow">If we don't find her, our future will be doomed.</font>

590
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,440
<font color="yellow">Do you want to become a director when you retire?</font>

591
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,380
<font color="yellow">I'll go this way. You should go that way.</font>

592
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,190
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Writer Ko!</font>

593
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,930
<font color="yellow">Min Joo, what happened to your leg?</font>

594
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,940
<font color="yellow">Nothing. Did you see Mi Rae on your way here by any chance?</font>

595
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,960
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae?</font>

596
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,830
<font color="yellow">Over there.</font>

597
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,990
<font color="yellow">Where is she going?</font>

598
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,060
<font color="yellow">Min Joo, are you okay?</font>

599
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,730
<font color="yellow">What's her condition like?</font>

600
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,190
<font color="yellow">She has weak knee cartilage.</font>

601
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,860
<font color="yellow">Cartilage?</font>

602
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,860
<font color="yellow">It's common amongst middle-aged women going through menopause.</font>

603
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,600
<font color="yellow">Here, you can see some cartilage deterioration in her knee.</font>

604
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,940
<font color="yellow">It's damaged, too.</font>

605
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,930
<font color="yellow">I think you should be hospitalised for treatments.</font>

606
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,880
<font color="yellow">It's not that serious at all.</font>

607
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,660
<font color="yellow">Just stay here and get the treatments you need.</font>

608
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,050
<font color="yellow">You have early-onset osteoporosis, too.</font>

609
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,990
<font color="yellow">You may need to get surgery if it gets worse.</font>

610
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,100
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae isn't answering her phone.</font>

611
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,460
<font color="yellow">I said she's not answering her phone.</font>

612
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,530
<font color="yellow">Stop worrying about her, and get your knee treated first.</font>

613
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,530
<font color="yellow">What is this mess, seriously?</font>

614
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,560
<font color="yellow">Why are you refusing to be hospitalised?</font>

615
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,330
<font color="yellow">I can't afford to stay at the hospital right now.</font>

616
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,310
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you get a hold of Mi Rae?</font>

617
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,330
<font color="yellow">No. She's not answering our calls, and we can't find her anywhere.</font>

618
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,290
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

619
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,460
<font color="yellow">I'm at a hospital.</font>

620
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:01,960
<font color="yellow">Hospital?</font>

621
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,190
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

622
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,990
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jun Woo.</font>

623
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,100
<font color="yellow">Hey. Has Mi Rae called you by any chance?</font>

624
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,370
<font color="yellow">No. Why do you ask?</font>

625
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,390
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae...</font>

626
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,330
<font color="yellow">suddenly left the broadcasting station.</font>

627
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,960
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I saw her leave.</font>

628
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,530
<font color="yellow">Why didn't she call me?</font>

629
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,720
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

630
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,260
<font color="yellow">While looking for Mi Rae,</font>

631
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,260
<font color="yellow">Min Joo got into an accident, so I'm at the emergency room.</font>

632
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
<font color="yellow">The emergency room?</font>

633
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,710
<font color="yellow">Please get some rest. I'll look for Mi Rae.</font>

634
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,130
<font color="yellow">How can I be hospitalised when she's missing?</font>

635
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,520
<font color="yellow">Please stay calm and get some rest.</font>

636
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,030
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Thank you.</font>

637
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,430
<font color="yellow">- Did you hear that?
-  I can't believe this is happening.</font>

638
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,980
<font color="yellow">I really look sick.</font>

639
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,530
<font color="yellow">You look sexier with those clothes on.</font>

640
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,720
<font color="yellow">Are you teasing me?</font>

641
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,360
<font color="yellow">Why? Were you embarrassed in front of me?</font>

642
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,050
<font color="yellow">No, I felt ashamed.</font>

643
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,960
<font color="yellow">I like your being honest like this.</font>

644
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,380
<font color="yellow">By the way, aren't you hungry? It's past dinner time.</font>

645
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,920
<font color="yellow">I'm fine, so you should go.</font>

646
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,290
<font color="yellow">Why would I leave you alone?</font>

647
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,390
<font color="yellow">There's no one to stay with you.</font>

648
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,400
<font color="yellow">I've already been alone on an ambulance once.</font>

649
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,690
<font color="yellow">This is nothing.</font>

650
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,630
<font color="yellow">Stay here for a minute.</font>

651
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,100
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, where are you?</font>

652
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,130
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you here?</font>

653
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,790
<font color="yellow">Hui Soo was in an accident.</font>

654
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,260
<font color="yellow">She's in surgery now.</font>

655
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,690
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

656
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,690
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

657
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,710
<font color="yellow">You must have worried a lot. It wasn't a major accident.</font>

658
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,160
<font color="yellow">What happened? Why are you hospitalised?</font>

659
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,660
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

660
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,060
<font color="yellow">I have something called chondromalacia patellae.</font>

661
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,430
<font color="yellow">Apparently, my knees have gotten weak.</font>

662
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,990
<font color="yellow">That's obvious at our age.</font>

663
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,820
<font color="yellow">Anyone over 40 ages and their cartilage becomes weaker.</font>

664
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,330
<font color="yellow">Don't you know you recover more slowly once you hurt yourself?</font>

665
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,260
<font color="yellow">Ageing...</font>

666
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,220
<font color="yellow">Why would you run when you have weak knees?</font>

667
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,550
<font color="yellow">I told you she was looking for Mi Rae.</font>

668
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,780
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it.</font>

669
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,390
<font color="yellow">Are you here to scold me?</font>

670
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,230
<font color="yellow">What happened to Mi Rae?</font>

671
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,830
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say she was doing well at work?</font>

672
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,050
<font color="yellow">Everything was fine when I sent you the text message.</font>

673
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,240
<font color="yellow">The meeting went well, too.</font>

674
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,060
<font color="yellow">But just when I went to the restroom...</font>

675
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,290
<font color="yellow">Min Joo didn't do anything wrong.</font>

676
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,280
<font color="yellow">She probably left because she couldn't adjust well.</font>

677
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,560
<font color="yellow">There's nothing wrong with Mi Rae.</font>

678
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,960
<font color="yellow">Broadcasting stations are strange.</font>

679
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,460
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

680
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,840
<font color="yellow">You said nothing would ever happen.</font>

681
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,650
<font color="yellow">Then why would she pack her things and run away?</font>

682
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:21,660
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

683
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,060
<font color="yellow">It's Mi Rae.</font>

684
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,430
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae, what happened? Where are you?</font>

685
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I should have made my decision more carefully.</font>

686
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:42,900
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for making everyone worried.</font>

687
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,790
<font color="yellow">My colleagues may sound harsh, but they're not bad people.</font>

688
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,560
<font color="yellow">Where are you now? Everyone's worried about you.</font>

689
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,860
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, Ha Ni.</font>

690
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,260
<font color="yellow">Ha Ni?</font>

691
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,660
<font color="yellow">Are you with someone?</font>

692
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,660
<font color="yellow">If it's difficult to get along with people,</font>

693
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,650
<font color="yellow">there are other ways to work around that,</font>

694
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,560
<font color="yellow">so don't make quick decisions. My goodness.</font>

695
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,060
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

696
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,160
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

697
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,590
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

698
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,090
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae?</font>

699
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,060
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

700
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,630
<font color="yellow">Why did you take away my phone?</font>

701
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,040
<font color="yellow">Where is she? Who is she with?</font>

702
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,260
<font color="yellow">She apologised, but she didn't tell me where she was.</font>

703
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,360
<font color="yellow">Who is Ha Ni?</font>

704
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,670
<font color="yellow">What did your colleagues do to her that she ran away?</font>

705
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,550
<font color="yellow">Are you blaming my colleagues?</font>

706
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,290
<font color="yellow">Why would she run away, then?</font>

707
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,620
<font color="yellow">Do I have to watch over Mi Rae all day long like she's a kid?</font>

708
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,850
<font color="yellow">That's why I asked you to take care of her.</font>

709
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,860
<font color="yellow">Goodness, please stop.</font>

710
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,590
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, my leg.
-  Are you okay?</font>

711
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,430
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Mi Rae.</font>

712
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,490
<font color="yellow">Just take care of yourself.</font>

713
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,760
<font color="yellow">Stay here and take care of her.</font>

714
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,230
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving?</font>

715
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,130
<font color="yellow">She apologised, but she didn't tell me where she was.</font>

716
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,460
<font color="yellow">Who is Ha Ni?</font>

717
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,630
<font color="yellow">Here's your medicine.</font>

718
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,790
<font color="yellow">Make sure to take it on time.</font>

719
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,150
<font color="yellow">Okay, you should go now.</font>

720
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,660
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying I should go?</font>

721
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,030
<font color="yellow">I'm going to spend the night here.</font>

722
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,590
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Why not?</font>

723
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,830
<font color="yellow">I've always lived alone. Being alone is better for me, so you should go.</font>

724
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,590
<font color="yellow">I don't want to leave.</font>

725
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,490
<font color="yellow">I'm also worried about you.</font>

726
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,430
<font color="yellow">My friends will stop by my house and bring me extra clothes,</font>

727
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,210
<font color="yellow">so don't worry and leave.</font>

728
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,510
<font color="yellow">Do you mean your friends from your housewarming party?</font>

729
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:13,940
<font color="yellow">Yes. Let me know if you get a call from Mi Rae.</font>

730
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,210
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

731
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,930
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bring her to you.</font>

732
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,390
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Jun Woo.</font>

733
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,660
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it.</font>

734
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,760
<font color="yellow">I guess I really got forced into taking a vacation, didn't I?</font>

735
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,860
<font color="yellow">Although, I did get scolded by Sang Sik.</font>

736
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,560
<font color="yellow">Don't worry so much about what he said.</font>

737
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,890
<font color="yellow">He's sensitive about his family.</font>

738
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,960
<font color="yellow">According to Mi Rae,</font>

739
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,950
<font color="yellow">he had a bad experience with a broadcasting station.</font>

740
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,430
<font color="yellow">What happened to him in the past?</font>

741
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,630
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

742
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,560
<font color="yellow">there was an accident.</font>

743
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:58,030
<font color="yellow">He lost his wife that day.</font>

744
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,030
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

745
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,690
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

746
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,960
<font color="yellow">I can see why he'd be sensitive.</font>

747
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,290
<font color="yellow">I think I know where Mi Rae is, so don't worry so much.</font>

748
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,330
<font color="yellow">Where's that?</font>

749
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,730
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have gone near a broadcasting station, right?</font>

750
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,760
<font color="yellow">Are you there again? I know where you are.</font>

751
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,890
<font color="yellow">Just wait until I see you.</font>

752
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,990
<font color="yellow">If you know, just let me be.</font>

753
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,460
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

754
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,260
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

755
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,660
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

756
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,750
<font color="yellow">I'll teach you a lesson today.</font>

757
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,680
<font color="yellow">I said I'll talk to you later. Why did you come here?</font>

758
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,390
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much everyone is worried about you?</font>

759
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,730
<font color="yellow">You're finished once I catch you.</font>

760
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,770
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

761
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,140
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? It's dangerous.</font>

762
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,160
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

763
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,060
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

764
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,360
<font color="yellow">Stay where you are. Once I catch you...</font>

765
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,660
<font color="yellow">That's dangerous.</font>

766
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,230
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop.</font>

767
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,940
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

768
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,250
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me.</font>

769
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,260
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

770
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,330
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

771
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,130
<font color="yellow">Just wait until I catch you.</font>

772
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,990
<font color="yellow">That's dangerous.</font>

773
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,530
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

774
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,930
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

775
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,310
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

776
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,510
<font color="yellow">Don't come near me.</font>

777
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:38,660
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  Stop.</font>

778
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,730
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

779
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,290
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Are you okay?</font>

780
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,130
<font color="yellow">How can she be okay?</font>

781
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,930
<font color="yellow">She almost died because of you.</font>

782
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</font>

783
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,230
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

784
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,120
<font color="yellow">Don't scold her so much.</font>

785
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,990
<font color="yellow">How can I not?</font>

786
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,450
<font color="yellow">I can't handle her.</font>

787
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,430
<font color="yellow">I said I'm sorry.</font>

788
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,060
<font color="yellow">Why did you run away from the broadcasting station?</font>

789
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,930
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she had a reason.</font>

790
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,230
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

791
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:47,390
<font color="yellow">"Just because"?</font>

792
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,420
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae, feel free to talk to me about it.</font>

793
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,060
<font color="yellow">That way, I'll be able to find a solution.</font>

794
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,130
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

795
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:00,030
<font color="yellow">your colleagues said they were going to get some coffee,</font>

796
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,690
<font color="yellow">so I went to the cafeteria, too.</font>

797
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,990
<font color="yellow">I wondered who it could be.</font>

798
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,730
<font color="yellow">So Ko Sang Sik is your brother?</font>

799
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,660
<font color="yellow">He's currently working at Woori City Hall, isn't he?</font>

800
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,060
<font color="yellow">I guess families are alike,</font>

801
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,230
<font color="yellow">seeing that you're also working in this industry.</font>

802
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:19,530
<font color="yellow">Do you know my brother well?</font>

803
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,590
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

804
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,260
<font color="yellow">Tell him to let it go now.</font>

805
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:28,600
<font color="yellow">Tell him to stop feeling guilty about what happened in the past.</font>

806
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,160
<font color="yellow">My brother didn't do it.</font>

807
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,610
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

808
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:35,130
<font color="yellow">It was only an accident.</font>

809
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,390
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

810
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,830
<font color="yellow">- Mi Rae.
-  Yes?</font>

811
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,560
<font color="yellow">What on earth happened?</font>

812
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,490
<font color="yellow">Did you meet someone?</font>

813
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:51,930
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

814
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,190
<font color="yellow">I heard some employees...</font>

815
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,630
<font color="yellow">saying that producing a drama is really difficult,</font>

816
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,890
<font color="yellow">so...</font>

817
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,660
<font color="yellow">I got very scared.</font>

818
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,590
<font color="yellow">Drink slowly.</font>

819
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,290
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm very sorry.</font>

820
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,960
<font color="yellow">Do you really not want to come back to work?</font>

821
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,960
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's something I can handle.</font>

822
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,490
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

823
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,900
<font color="yellow">He won't leave his mother's side.</font>

824
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,190
<font color="yellow">That's Ha Ni.</font>

825
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,760
<font color="yellow">She gave birth to a pony not so long ago. Aren't they beautiful?</font>

826
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,490
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

827
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,730
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

828
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,560
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

829
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:08,530
<font color="yellow">At first,</font>

830
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,830
<font color="yellow">everyone needs help.</font>

831
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,490
<font color="yellow">Did Ha Ni run fast from the start?</font>

832
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,490
<font color="yellow">There's no one who can run from the beginning.</font>

833
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:21,690
<font color="yellow">At first,</font>

834
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,990
<font color="yellow">I was very scared, and I had a hard time, too.</font>

835
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:31,290
<font color="yellow">I thought my dream had finally come true,</font>

836
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,030
<font color="yellow">but I also had doubts on whether or not I could continue working.</font>

837
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:36,030
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do.</font>

838
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:40,530
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

839
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,460
<font color="yellow">When I first started work,</font>

840
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,490
<font color="yellow">I was so excited to hear...</font>

841
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,460
<font color="yellow">that I got hired.</font>

842
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,290
<font color="yellow">But I lost someone I loved only after then.</font>

843
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,660
<font color="yellow">We were about to get married.</font>

844
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,460
<font color="yellow">At that time, I was an assistant producer,</font>

845
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,360
<font color="yellow">so I didn't get to have any personal life.</font>

846
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,630
<font color="yellow">I couldn't be there to say goodbye to him.</font>

847
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:24,290
<font color="yellow">That's when I started to have doubts about this job.</font>

848
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,630
<font color="yellow">I couldn't see the point in working.</font>

849
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,390
<font color="yellow">I went to work while crying every day.</font>

850
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,430
<font color="yellow">I went to the editing room while crying.</font>

851
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:40,490
<font color="yellow">I wanted to run away then, but I had nowhere to go.</font>

852
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,330
<font color="yellow">Somehow I ended up here.</font>

853
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:49,490
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you would've had such an experience.</font>

854
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,360
<font color="yellow">People all get scared and want to run away.</font>

855
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:57,160
<font color="yellow">It's not just you. I was like that, too.</font>

856
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,160
<font color="yellow">However, I just didn't have anywhere to go.</font>

857
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,960
<font color="yellow">I didn't have the courage to quit, either.</font>

858
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,930
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

859
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:08,330
<font color="yellow">It's okay to be scared.</font>

860
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,850
<font color="yellow">I won't tell you to be brave.</font>

861
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:12,360
<font color="yellow">It's okay to feel scared. There's nothing wrong with that.</font>

862
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,190
<font color="yellow">Just know that...</font>

863
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:25,190
<font color="yellow">there's someone by your side who understands...</font>

864
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,860
<font color="yellow">what you're going through.</font>

865
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,720
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

866
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,460
<font color="yellow">I'm just sweating.</font>

867
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,230
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

868
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:48,460
<font color="yellow">Feel free to tell me whenever you're scared or having a hard time.</font>

869
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,330
<font color="yellow">I'm more of your neighbour than...</font>

870
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,530
<font color="yellow">a drama producer.</font>

871
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,260
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

872
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,460
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

873
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,630
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

874
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,460
<font color="yellow">Why won't you listen and go home with us?</font>

875
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,430
<font color="yellow">Spend some time alone. Come when you're ready.</font>

876
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,590
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

877
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:39,930
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

878
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

879
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,060
<font color="yellow">for making you worried.</font>

880
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,860
<font color="yellow">It's fine as long as you're okay.</font>

881
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,460
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Sang Sik?</font>

882
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,730
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

883
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,890
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

884
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,260
<font color="yellow">I lost someone I loved only after then.</font>

885
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,460
<font color="yellow">We were about to get married.</font>

886
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,360
<font color="yellow">All he did was work hard, but you killed him overnight!</font>

887
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,160
<font color="yellow">How can you call this an accident?</font>

888
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:55,930
<font color="yellow">- An accident?
-  Mum.</font>

889
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,610
<font color="yellow">Bring me the person who was in charge!</font>

890
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,230
<font color="yellow">Tell him to come here!</font>

891
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:05,060
<font color="yellow">How could this happen to my son? How could this happen?</font>

892
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,130
<font color="yellow">How is this possible?</font>

893
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:00,990
<font color="yellow">I have a lot to apologise for.</font>

894
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:06,340
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm the one who told you that things were going well...</font>

895
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,730
<font color="yellow">without knowing that Mi Rae had disappeared. It's my fault.</font>

896
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,390
<font color="yellow">How are your knees?</font>

897
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:14,590
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it didn't get worse after you fell again a while ago?</font>

898
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,760
<font color="yellow">I was startled then, but I'm fine now.</font>

899
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,590
<font color="yellow">Did you get a scratch?</font>

900
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,160
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's only a scratch.</font>

901
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:28,330
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

902
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:31,990
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to,</font>

903
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:35,160
<font color="yellow">but I overheard what you said to Mi Rae.</font>

904
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,030
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

905
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,030
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past. It's okay.</font>

906
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,490
<font color="yellow">You must have gone through a lot.</font>

907
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:56,330
<font color="yellow">When someone who's always been around is no longer there,</font>

908
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:00,390
