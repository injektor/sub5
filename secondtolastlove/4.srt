<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,480
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's count down together.</font>

<font color="yellow">What? What are you doing here?</font>

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,650
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

12
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,880
<font color="yellow">This is tonight's opening couple. Congratulations.</font>

13
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,020
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

14
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,710
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations.
-  Congratulations.</font>

15
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,070

-  No.</font>

16
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,810
<font color="yellow">- Why? Why?
-  Come with us.</font>

17
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,120
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
-  Come this way.</font>

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,950
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji! Ye Ji!</font>

19
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,820
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,230
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

21
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,280
<font color="yellow">We're doing the opening show.</font>

22
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,680
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,350
<font color="yellow">Please start us off with an opening dance.</font>

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:17,220
<font color="yellow">- Dance!
-  Dance!</font>

25
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,990
<font color="yellow">- Dance!
-  Dance!</font>

26
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,150
<font color="yellow">Come on. Let's get it over with so we can go back down.</font>

27
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,460
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to dance here?</font>

28
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,990
<font color="yellow">What else can we do?</font>

29
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,490
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,450
<font color="yellow">How should I do it?</font>

31
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

32
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,880
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and get us down!</font>

33
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,520
<font color="yellow">I was scared to death.</font>

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,050
<font color="yellow">How can a woman have no fear?</font>

35
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,120
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here anyway?</font>

36
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,080
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

37
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,920
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik. Min Joo.</font>

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,950
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,980
<font color="yellow">It just turned out that way.</font>

40
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,580
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji.</font>

42
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,080
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm Ye Ji's friend, Kim Hyun Seok.</font>

43
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,680
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

44
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,090
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

45
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,850
<font color="yellow">This is so embarrassing.</font>

46
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,350
<font color="yellow">Embarrassing?</font>

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,330
<font color="yellow">How can you come all the way here?</font>

48
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,560
<font color="yellow">You have the final English contest today. Why are you here?</font>

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,560
<font color="yellow">Because I didn't want to go there, and I wanted to come here.</font>

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,090
<font color="yellow">Are you joking me?</font>

51
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,030
<font color="yellow">Just leave me alone.</font>

52
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,240
<font color="yellow">You're pressuring me.</font>

53
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,590
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

54
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,130
<font color="yellow">Do you know why you're so obsessed with me?</font>

55
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,930
<font color="yellow">What? Obsessed?</font>

56
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,770
<font color="yellow">It's because you don't date.</font>

57
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,860
<font color="yellow">You should give all that energy and interest to your lover.</font>

58
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,920
<font color="yellow">Since you don't have one, you're bothering me.</font>

59
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,000
<font color="yellow">You need to focus on your own life now.</font>

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,280
<font color="yellow">Just leave me alone!</font>

61
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,740
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

62
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,520
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
-  Let me go.</font>

63
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,420
<font color="yellow">- That's enough.
-  Just let me go.</font>

64
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,080
<font color="yellow">This is family business. You should step out.</font>

65
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,290
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

66
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,150
<font color="yellow">Gosh, the concert is going to be over soon.</font>

67
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,220
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

68
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,150
<font color="yellow">Your name is Ye Ji, right?</font>

69
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,720
<font color="yellow">Get out of my way.</font>

70
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,150
<font color="yellow">I think it would be best for you to talk to your dad first.</font>

71
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,950
<font color="yellow">This is so annoying.</font>

72
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,800
<font color="yellow">Uncle Jun Woo, is this your girlfriend?</font>

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,820
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

74
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,220
<font color="yellow">If she is, take her away and shut her mouth.</font>

75
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,350
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Hey!</font>

76
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,620
<font color="yellow">That little...</font>

77
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,290
<font color="yellow">We have no choice. Just say that she dropped out.</font>

78
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,250
<font color="yellow">If you found her,</font>

79
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,720
<font color="yellow">you should try and persuade her.</font>

80
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,620
<font color="yellow">It's no use. I know her. She's my daughter, after all.</font>

81
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,520
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

82
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,050
<font color="yellow">I'll tell them that she withdrew.</font>

83
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

84
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,320

88
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,750
<font color="yellow">- I gave up.
-  Ye Ji.</font>

89
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,650
<font color="yellow">You're the guy who bought the ticket earlier, right?</font>

90
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,450
<font color="yellow">Are they your friends?</font>

91

<font color="yellow">Yes, Dad.</font>

<font color="yellow">Dad?</font>

93
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,150
<font color="yellow">No way. How can your dad come to a place like this?</font>

94
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
<font color="yellow">Bo Gyeong had to leave because something came up,</font>

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,220
<font color="yellow">and he bought her ticket to go in.</font>

96
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,050
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

97
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,950

100
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, sure.</font>

101
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,640

-  Pizza? Okay.</font>

105
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,150
<font color="yellow">- It looks delicious.
-  Wow.</font>

106
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,760
<font color="yellow">Please have a slice.</font>

107
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,780
<font color="yellow">Dad, you should have some.</font>

108
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,340
<font color="yellow">It's all right, you guys have it.</font>

109
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,870

-  Thank you.</font>

110

<font color="yellow">Thank you, Sir.</font>

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,580

112

<font color="yellow">I want to hear a guy's opinion.</font>

113
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,200
<font color="yellow">My dad's not that big of a fan.</font>

114
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,350
<font color="yellow">Why not? If he likes them enough to come to a concert,</font>

115
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,850
<font color="yellow">I bet he knows their names.</font>

116
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,140
<font color="yellow">Actually, he came to...</font>

117
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,220
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji.</font>

118
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,740
<font color="yellow">I promise to study them before coming next time.</font>

119
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,450
<font color="yellow">I'll read their profiles beforehand.</font>

120
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,260
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

121
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,320
<font color="yellow">The next concert is in Busan, though.</font>

122
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,420
<font color="yellow">- Right?
-  Are you going to go?</font>

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,450
<font color="yellow">Sure. Why not?</font>

124
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,320

-  I'm jealous.</font>

125
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,730
<font color="yellow">Stop making fun of me.</font>

126
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,840
<font color="yellow">I wanted to dance well up there, too.</font>

127
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,490
<font color="yellow">You were good.</font>

128
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,770
<font color="yellow">You're a dancing queen compared to Sang Sik.</font>

129
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,320
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty bad myself, but he was...</font>

130
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,880
<font color="yellow">Didn't it still help with getting rid of your stress?</font>

131
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,150
<font color="yellow">- I guess it did.
-  See? Wasn't it a good idea?</font>

132
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,080
<font color="yellow">Was her name Ye Ji?</font>

133
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,120
<font color="yellow">She's not your ordinary kid. She's feisty.</font>

134
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,120
<font color="yellow">She still grew up well.</font>

135
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,480
<font color="yellow">They say daughters need a mother's care.</font>

136
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,650
<font color="yellow">What happened to her mother?</font>

137
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,050
<font color="yellow">Her mother...</font>

138
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,320
<font color="yellow">died after giving birth to Ye Ji.</font>

139
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,120
<font color="yellow">She was such a wonderful person.</font>

140
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,150
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik had it tough.</font>

141
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,150
<font color="yellow">How long have the two of you known each other?</font>

142
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,850
<font color="yellow">Well, from when we were really young.</font>

143
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,120
<font color="yellow">This is my hometown, and I used to live here too...</font>

144
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,820
<font color="yellow">until I immigrated to Canada.</font>

145
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,480
<font color="yellow">You said you studied there, right?</font>

146
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,280
<font color="yellow">More so wander around than study.</font>

147
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,220
<font color="yellow">Now let's talk about you.</font>

148
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,750
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

149
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,380
<font color="yellow">Why are you unmarried and still single?</font>

150
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,950
<font color="yellow">Do you dislike men?</font>

151
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,250
<font color="yellow">Men are great.</font>

152
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,980
<font color="yellow">But at this age,</font>

153
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,620
<font color="yellow">it's hard to meet someone.</font>

154
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,750
<font color="yellow">Your age?</font>

155
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,750
<font color="yellow">If he's a good catch, he's either already married...</font>

156
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,650
<font color="yellow">or is with someone else.</font>

158

<font color="yellow">It's hard to find good conversational partners.</font>

159
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,750
<font color="yellow">I had a good time thanks to you.</font>

160
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,280
<font color="yellow">Does that mean it was a successful date?</font>

161
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,200
<font color="yellow">If we walk around like this,</font>

162
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
<font color="yellow">everyone would think that I'm the aunt and you're my nephew.</font>

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,780
<font color="yellow">How about this then?</font>

164
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,420
<font color="yellow">You don't like it?</font>

165
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

166
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,350
<font color="yellow">What about this? Do you like it?</font>

167
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,250
<font color="yellow">You must watch a lot of dramas.</font>

168

175
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,250
<font color="yellow">When you like someone, you just like everything about them.</font>

176
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,680
<font color="yellow">You don't pick and choose what to like.</font>

177
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,350
<font color="yellow">It's not something you can pinpoint.</font>

178
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,820
<font color="yellow">Well, you can start pinpointing now.</font>

179
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,620
<font color="yellow">You should be more picky.</font>

180
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,620
<font color="yellow">I don't want to. That means I don't like you.</font>

181
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,140
<font color="yellow">If you do this again, I won't let you off so easy.</font>

182
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,700
<font color="yellow">I won't get caught next time.</font>

183
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,950
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

184
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,950
<font color="yellow">I didn't get an answer yet.</font>

185
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,150
<font color="yellow">That's enough joking around. Go inside.</font>

186
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620

<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

192
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,950
<font color="yellow">I saw your drama. I told you to be responsible, not make trouble.</font>

193
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,860
<font color="yellow">Why did you make such a bold decision?</font>

194
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,150
<font color="yellow">If there aren't any expedients or settlements,</font>

195
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,700
<font color="yellow">we have to follow the rules.</font>

196
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,580
<font color="yellow">To make up for what you did, are you unable to go to work?</font>

<font color="yellow">I can take care of myself.</font>

206
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,550

207
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,480

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
<font color="yellow">That kid is a lot more desperate than I am.</font>

211
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,150
<font color="yellow">That's when I knew that I lost already.</font>

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,780
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

308
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,120
<font color="yellow">Aren't you glad...</font>

309
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,150
<font color="yellow">I have an orange?</font>

310
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,130
<font color="yellow">Guess what time it is in Indonesia.</font>

311
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,820
<font color="yellow">Indonesia?</font>

312
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,750
<font color="yellow">Is it 4pm?</font>

313
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,020
<font color="yellow">How do you say you're not sure in Japanese?</font>

314
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,050
<font color="yellow">I'm confused.</font>

315
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,450
<font color="yellow">What about in Chinese?</font>

316
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,150
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

317
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,680
<font color="yellow">- Tilting.
-  Tilting!</font>

318
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,720
<font color="yellow">What about in French?</font>

319
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,250
<font color="yellow">- It's vague.
-  In German?</font>

320
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,520
<font color="yellow">It's uncertain.</font>

321
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,050
<font color="yellow">What about in Ghana?</font>

322
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,570
<font color="yellow">Ghana?</font>

323
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,850
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

324
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,270
<font color="yellow">- You just spat on me.
-  My goodness.</font>

325
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,880
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
-  I'm sorry.</font>

326
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,550
<font color="yellow">I already know all this, but why is it still so funny?</font>

327
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,750
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

328
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,090
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

329
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,480
<font color="yellow">I think we drank too much.</font>

330
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,050
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

331
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,950
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

332
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,850
<font color="yellow">I've never been as...</font>

333
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,220
<font color="yellow">scared and uncertain...</font>

334
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,420
<font color="yellow">about the future like today.</font>

335
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,620
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about retirement?</font>

336
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,680
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

337
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,320
<font color="yellow">Retirement.</font>

338
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,150
<font color="yellow">I made...</font>

339
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,050
<font color="yellow">so many decisions until now.</font>

340
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,680
<font color="yellow">I had self-respect...</font>

341
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,280
<font color="yellow">for coming all the way here. On the other hand,</font>

342
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,720
<font color="yellow">I asked myself if that's as far as I can go.</font>

343
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,980
<font color="yellow">I also felt shameful.</font>

344
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,720
<font color="yellow">It's best to believe that all of your choices were right.</font>

345
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,320
<font color="yellow">If you don't, you won't have anything left behind.</font>

346
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,220
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

347
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,220
<font color="yellow">Pay the bill and come out.</font>

348
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,050
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

349
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,790
<font color="yellow">I'm a poor civil servant.</font>

350
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,850
<font color="yellow">You should pay since you earn so much money.</font>

351
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,420
<font color="yellow">I might become jobless soon.</font>

352
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,460
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

353
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,920
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I'm fine.</font>

354
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,150
<font color="yellow">What the...</font>

355
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,650
<font color="yellow">You're not...</font>

356
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,350
<font color="yellow">giving me a piggyback, are you?</font>

357
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,050
<font color="yellow">Are you confused again?</font>

358
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,150
<font color="yellow">You're too old to carry with my arms.</font>

359
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
<font color="yellow">Too old? What kind of old person does this?</font>

360
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
<font color="yellow">I'm so good at drinking.</font>

361
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,890
<font color="yellow">I've never once lost...</font>

362
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,050
<font color="yellow">a drinking competition with men.</font>

363
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,050
<font color="yellow">I would walk home straight and sleep on my bed.</font>

364
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,520
<font color="yellow">Sure you did.</font>

365
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,550
<font color="yellow">It's because you got too old.</font>

366
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,050
<font color="yellow">Old?</font>

367
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,950
<font color="yellow">My brain stopped ageing at the age of 30,</font>

368
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,490
<font color="yellow">and my heart stopped at 20.</font>

369
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,520
<font color="yellow">When did I become an adult?</font>

370
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,350
<font color="yellow">Why are you mumbling into my ear? That's ticklish.</font>

371
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,750
<font color="yellow">Are we far away?</font>

372
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,960
<font color="yellow">We're almost there.</font>

373
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,420
<font color="yellow">Then let me down.</font>

374
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,050
<font color="yellow">Also, let's consider that this never happened. Okay?</font>

375
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,090
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

376
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,980
<font color="yellow">It must have been tough for you to be alone.</font>

377
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,920
<font color="yellow">It's hard as it is for me to take care of myself.</font>

378
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,350
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

379
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,750
<font color="yellow">You must be lonely.</font>

380
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,820
<font color="yellow">(Resignation letter)</font>

381
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,320
<font color="yellow">No, stop...</font>

382
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,950
<font color="yellow">- I only have you in this world
-  I only have you in this world</font>

383
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,750
<font color="yellow">Why are you mumbling into my ear?</font>

384
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

385
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,350
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

386
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,750
<font color="yellow">Why did I do that?</font>

387
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

388
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,120
<font color="yellow">I tried making it the way you told me yesterday.</font>

389
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,720
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

390
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,680
<font color="yellow">It's too salty.</font>

391
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

392
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,490
<font color="yellow">Preparing the shellfish is the most important.</font>

393
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,750
<font color="yellow">Seafood is already salty.</font>

394
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,450
<font color="yellow">They cook at different times, so you also have to put them in order.</font>

395
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

396
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,880
<font color="yellow">It's so delicious.</font>

397
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,720
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
-  You dance well,</font>

398
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,320
<font color="yellow">but your cooking is horrible.</font>

399
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,820
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

400
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,390
<font color="yellow">I told you, didn't I?</font>

401
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,980
<font color="yellow">She's Uncle Jun Woo's girlfriend.</font>

402
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
<font color="yellow">Let's slice this zucchini now.</font>

403
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,150
<font color="yellow">Why is she here?</font>

404
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,630
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What is going on over there?</font>

405
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,720
<font color="yellow">Why are you up at this hour?</font>

406
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,560
<font color="yellow">I heard Jun Woo made spicy fish soup.</font>

407
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,880
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo! What are you doing?</font>

408
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,550
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Let's eat now.</font>

409
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,760
<font color="yellow">What brings you here at this early hour?</font>

410
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,390
<font color="yellow">I'm here because I don't want to eat alone!</font>

411
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,580
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Is your face all right?</font>

412
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,380
<font color="yellow">It's better now.</font>

413
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,420
<font color="yellow">What are you two talking about?</font>

414
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,630
<font color="yellow">This family loves trouble.</font>

415
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,840
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji crashed her car, Sang Hee ruined her face,</font>

416
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,850
<font color="yellow">and I...</font>

417
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,220
<font color="yellow">We're such troublemakers. Gosh, I'm hungry.</font>

418
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,550
<font color="yellow">Hey, come in.</font>

419
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,920
<font color="yellow">It's good to see all of your family members eating together.</font>

420
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,850
<font color="yellow">There are so many of us, right? Please have a seat here.</font>

421
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,850
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

422
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,450
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

423
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm relieved. Your face looks so much better now.</font>

424
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,510
<font color="yellow">I went through so much trouble thanks to you.</font>

425
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,110
<font color="yellow">Things always get worse before they get better.</font>

426
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,210
<font color="yellow">It's part of the detoxification process, not a side effect.</font>

427
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,220
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

428
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,330
<font color="yellow">Just eat your food.</font>

429
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,350
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

430
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,620
<font color="yellow">By the way, why does everyone seem so uneasy today?</font>

431
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,570
<font color="yellow">Well, if it's because of me...</font>

432
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,920
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't say that.</font>

433
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,420
<font color="yellow">Everyone, I have an important announcement to make.</font>

434
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,210
<font color="yellow">Her name is Kang Min Joo. Her age is...</font>

435
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,620
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

436
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,610
<font color="yellow">Let's move on. She's a producer at the drama department at SBC.</font>

437
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,760
<font color="yellow">Seriously? You're a drama producer?</font>

438
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. That's so cool.</font>

439
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,350
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji, I'll tell you more about those things later.</font>

440
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,480
<font color="yellow">So what's the announcement?</font>

441
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,980
<font color="yellow">Min Joo...</font>

442
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,120
<font color="yellow">is my girlfriend as of today.</font>

443
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,120
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

444
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,780
<font color="yellow">So it'd be greatly appreciated if all of you can be considerate...</font>

445
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,620
<font color="yellow">and respectful towards her.</font>

446
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,720
<font color="yellow">All right, let's applaud.</font>

447
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,350
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

448
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,750
<font color="yellow">What is the matter with you?</font>

449
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,520
<font color="yellow">It's all right. There's nothing wrong with it.</font>

450
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,550
<font color="yellow">It's not all right at all.</font>

451
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,150
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is going on here?</font>

452
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,290
<font color="yellow">My name is Kang Min Joo, and I moved to the house next door recently.</font>

453
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,420
<font color="yellow">Many things have happened already, but I hope all of us can get along.</font>

454
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

455
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,710
<font color="yellow">Wait, Min Joo.</font>

456
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,150
<font color="yellow">You literally just met her. Do you date anyone you meet?</font>

457
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,350
<font color="yellow">She's not anyone.</font>

458
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,050
<font color="yellow">Min Joo!</font>

459
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,150
<font color="yellow">Wait, Min Joo.</font>

460
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,350
<font color="yellow">How can you do that?</font>

461
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,380
<font color="yellow">You didn't consider my opinion or feelings at all.</font>

462
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,950
<font color="yellow">They're like family to me.</font>

463
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,140
<font color="yellow">I apologise if I upset you. I was just...</font>

464
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,420
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

465
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,420
<font color="yellow">I don't know what I did to make you get the wrong message,</font>

466
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,050
<font color="yellow">but stop this nonsense already.</font>

467
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,950
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

468
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,750
<font color="yellow">I'm in a bind.</font>

469
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

470
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,380
<font color="yellow">Goodness gracious.</font>

471
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,050
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

472
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

473
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,420
<font color="yellow">- Me?
-  Do you see anyone else?</font>

474
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

475
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,570
<font color="yellow">Ride your bicycle carefully when you pass by people.</font>

476
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,250
<font color="yellow">That's a bicycle lane. You should walk on the pavement.</font>

477
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,420
<font color="yellow">It's narrow, so I...</font>

478
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,930
<font color="yellow">Well, I guess not everyone can walk on that lane.</font>

479
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,150
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

480
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,870
<font color="yellow">"Do you date anyone you meet?"</font>

481
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,450
<font color="yellow">Am I a pebble everyone stumbles upon on the street or what?</font>

482
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,410
<font color="yellow">You must've come across as so easy.</font>

483
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,650
<font color="yellow">That's why you got drunk and got dragged into that situation.</font>

484
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,210
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

485
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,480
<font color="yellow">You passed out because you can't even drink well.</font>

486
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,630
<font color="yellow">I have no idea how you've been able to live alone all these years.</font>

487
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,380
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it. It's a mystery.</font>

488
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,050
<font color="yellow">I know I drank with you once, but that doesn't mean...</font>

489
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,550
<font color="yellow">you can think of me as a joke.</font>

490
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,070
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Guys must like me...</font>

491
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,050
<font color="yellow">because I'm still quite attractive.</font>

492
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,820
<font color="yellow">I can't really stop guys from falling for me.</font>

493
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,150
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

494
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,650
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

495
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,250
<font color="yellow">Look at you. Is this how you snatch guys?</font>

496
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,620
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that woman!</font>

497
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,150
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

498
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,620
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
-  What's going on?</font>

499
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,550
<font color="yellow">Where are my team members?</font>

500
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

501
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,880
<font color="yellow">Just fire me. I don't want to do my team members any harm!</font>

502
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,840
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? It's a considerate gesture.</font>

503
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,750
<font color="yellow">They didn't even want it! It's abuse of authority.</font>

504
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,440
<font color="yellow">I stopped them from transferring you to the branch in the countryside.</font>

505
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,450
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll just quit, then.</font>

506
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,550
<font color="yellow">Wait, Min Joo!</font>

507
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,960
<font color="yellow">They'll fire me if you quit.</font>

508
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,800
<font color="yellow">No one is as capable as you are.</font>

509
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,770
<font color="yellow">That's also why I'm able to keep my position.</font>

510
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,320
<font color="yellow">You know that I've done more than enough.</font>

511
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,420
<font color="yellow">I think my passion for making dramas is going away, too.</font>

512
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,650
<font color="yellow">And to be honest, I'm not as energetic as I used to be.</font>

513
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,560
<font color="yellow">We need an explanation for the plagiarised drama.</font>

514
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,110
<font color="yellow">I completely understand how you're feeling.</font>

515
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,450
<font color="yellow">You did the right thing. I'm not saying what you did is wrong.</font>

516
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,630
<font color="yellow">Come up with an idea for a drama that people will love.</font>

517
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,720
<font color="yellow">Then everything will go back to normal as if nothing happened.</font>

518
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,150
<font color="yellow">I made so many decisions until now.</font>

519
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,820
<font color="yellow">I had self-respect...</font>

520
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,350
<font color="yellow">for coming all the way here. On the other hand,</font>

521
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,450
<font color="yellow">I asked myself if that's as far as I can go.</font>

522
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,720
<font color="yellow">I also felt shameful.</font>

523
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,320
<font color="yellow">Don't get all emotional and submit a letter of resignation.</font>

524
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,720
<font color="yellow">Just put up with it and don't quit.</font>

525
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,880
<font color="yellow">That's not losing. Look at the bigger picture.</font>

526
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,020
<font color="yellow">Come in, Chief Ko.</font>

527
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,870
<font color="yellow">I summoned you urgently because I have something to tell you.</font>

528
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,150
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat.
-  Okay.</font>

529
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:42,320
<font color="yellow">The business support department should be in charge...</font>

530
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,250
<font color="yellow">of managing all events related to Woori Grape Festival.</font>

531
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,080
<font color="yellow">The local tourism department will work on site at the events.</font>

532
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,700
<font color="yellow">Hang on. My department came up with the idea for the festival.</font>

533
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,830
<font color="yellow">I know, but the situation has changed due to the merger, though.</font>

534
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,950
<font color="yellow">The merger?</font>

535
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,910
<font color="yellow">My department's plan for the festival was chosen,</font>

536
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,220
<font color="yellow">so my team should be in charge of managing the events.</font>

537
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,240
<font color="yellow">I know how hard your team members worked for it.</font>

538
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,700
<font color="yellow">You're probably reacting like this because of the incentive.</font>

539
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,320
<font color="yellow">Let's revisit the issue after the festival.</font>

540
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,650
<font color="yellow">Head Chief.</font>

541
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,940
<font color="yellow">Compensating the employees for their hard work is very important.</font>

542
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,580
<font color="yellow">However, what is more important is...</font>

543
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,110
<font color="yellow">the fact that no one else knows the information my team shared...</font>

544
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,040
<font color="yellow">and what they did for the residents better than my team members do.</font>

545
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,610
<font color="yellow">Such knowledge can't be fully transferred.</font>

546
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,850
<font color="yellow">Lower your voice!</font>

547
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,080
<font color="yellow">How dare you raise your voice in front of the deputy mayor?</font>

548
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,620
<font color="yellow">Send all files related to Woori Grape Festival...</font>

549
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,950
<font color="yellow">to the business support department.</font>

550
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,850
<font color="yellow">Chief. I thought we were in charge of the project.</font>

551
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,940
<font color="yellow">Why should we? This is ridiculous.</font>

552
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,150
<font color="yellow">We skipped our vacations and pulled numerous all-nighters for that.</font>

553
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,480
<font color="yellow">To contribute to enriching the local community...</font>

554
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,680
<font color="yellow">You think I don't know that?</font>

555
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,550
<font color="yellow">Let's be grateful that the festival isn't being cancelled.</font>

556
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,980
<font color="yellow">Preventing damage to the residents...</font>

557
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,050
<font color="yellow">is more important than getting our team's work recognised.</font>

558
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,280
<font color="yellow">Still, this is crazy.</font>

559
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're here.</font>

560
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,520
<font color="yellow">- Producer Kang.
-  Producer Kang.</font>

561
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,450
<font color="yellow">- Tidy up and clean the space.
-  Okay.</font>

562
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,930
<font color="yellow">All right. Our lives depend on coming up with good ideas.</font>

563
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,890
<font color="yellow">- All of you are aware, right?
-  How can they do this?</font>

564
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,420
<font color="yellow">The company should thank us for sending out the notice.</font>

565
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,310
<font color="yellow">How can they demote us?</font>

566
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,920
<font color="yellow">Exactly. Someone is obviously responsible for all of this mess.</font>

567
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,400
<font color="yellow">This isn't a demotion.</font>

568
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,670
<font color="yellow">Are you belittling the strategic planning team?</font>

569
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,540
<font color="yellow">We're so happy that Producer Kang is here now.</font>

570
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,310
<font color="yellow">I agree. Both Strategic Planning Team 1 and 2 are doing so well.</font>

571
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,870
<font color="yellow">It's always our team that gets in trouble.</font>

572
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,850
<font color="yellow">- It is obviously a demotion.
-  Goodness.</font>

573
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,450
<font color="yellow">Hey, explain to her so that she understands. Have a good day.</font>

574
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,480
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

575
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,380
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that sly slacker.</font>

576
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

577
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,080
<font color="yellow">We just need to plan a good project.</font>

578
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,120
<font color="yellow">As you get older,</font>

579
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,280
<font color="yellow">the distinction between good and bad becomes increasingly vague.</font>

580
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,820
<font color="yellow">Please move over.</font>

581
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,850
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

582
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,110
<font color="yellow">- Gosh!
-  What are you doing now?</font>

583
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,120
<font color="yellow">Being righteous puts you at a disadvantage.</font>

584
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,820
<font color="yellow">If you're prickly, you get hammered.</font>

585
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,260
<font color="yellow">If you fall victim to injustice after doing something right,</font>

586
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,120
<font color="yellow">you compromise your principles in order to survive...</font>

587
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,320
<font color="yellow">and say that it's the reality to make yourself feel better.</font>

588
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,750
<font color="yellow">Until when...</font>

589
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,250
<font color="yellow">Until when do I have to live as an adult like this?</font>

590
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,050
<font color="yellow">Until when do I have to live as an adult like this?</font>

591
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,450
<font color="yellow">(To Min Joo, I'm sorry.)</font>

592
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo!</font>

593
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,820
<font color="yellow">Could I get her bill?</font>

594
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
<font color="yellow">Is this all?</font>

595
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,220
<font color="yellow">This is her fifth order.</font>

596
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,780
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo, I'll explain.</font>

597
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,280
<font color="yellow">I tried ordering everything on the menu, but nothing is good.</font>

598
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,780
<font color="yellow">I was going to force myself to eat, but the dishes taste so horrible.</font>

599
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,550
<font color="yellow">You can put it on my card.</font>

600
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,440
<font color="yellow">I will, but we unfortunately have to...</font>

601
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,490
<font color="yellow">put this customer's name on our hotel's blacklist.</font>

602
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,420
<font color="yellow">Your blacklist?</font>

603
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,490
<font color="yellow">- That's crazy. What did I do?
-  Sit down.</font>

604
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,420
<font color="yellow">Take this and buy whatever you want to eat,</font>

605
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,320
<font color="yellow">whether it's street food or something from a hotel restaurant.</font>

606
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,410
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask you for money! I just want to eat something you made.</font>

607
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,650
<font color="yellow">I can't do that for you any more.</font>

608
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,150
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

609
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,580
<font color="yellow">I've become anorexic because I have not been able to eat your food.</font>

610
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,720
<font color="yellow">You always call me for help when you get yourself in trouble.</font>

611
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,920
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired of this now.</font>

612
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,420
<font color="yellow">- Jun Woo.
-  There's someone I like.</font>

613
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,120
<font color="yellow">So don't call me any more.</font>

614
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,150
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

615
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,750
<font color="yellow">I'll change my phone number, too.</font>

616
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,490
<font color="yellow">No, don't do that. Don't!</font>

617
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,680
<font color="yellow">Be responsible for your own life from now on, please.</font>

618
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,780
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo! Jun Woo!</font>

619
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
<font color="yellow">Tae Yeon.</font>

620
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,550
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  We talked about your profession.</font>

621
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,060
<font color="yellow">So is that how old you're turning this year?</font>

622
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,840
<font color="yellow">Is that all you want to know about me?</font>

623
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,950
<font color="yellow">You keep asking me my age.</font>

624
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,880
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

625
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,020
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I will get going now.</font>

626
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,750
<font color="yellow">No, I'll get going first.</font>

627
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,080
<font color="yellow">I'll get the bill.</font>

628
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,320
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What is this ridiculous situation?</font>

629
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,250
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

630
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,760
<font color="yellow">Did you say that someone stopped by?</font>

631
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,320
<font color="yellow">Yes. He said that we have to take meticulous care of this car...</font>

632
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,820
<font color="yellow">because the owner of this car is very fussy.</font>

633
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,640
<font color="yellow">And who is that?</font>

634
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,580
<font color="yellow">Mr Ko Sang Sik who works at the city hall.</font>

635
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,110
<font color="yellow">I'll call you when everything is done, including polishing.</font>

636
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,320
<font color="yellow">You can pick it up then.</font>

637
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,630
<font color="yellow">I fought the urge to submit my letter of resignation.</font>

638
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,850
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

639
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,680
<font color="yellow">I guess you worry about anyone you meet.</font>

640
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,490
<font color="yellow">Ma'am! I'll get what he's eating. A large size, please!</font>

641
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,490
<font color="yellow">Chief.</font>

642
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,520
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

643
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,650
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can ever become a public official like you.</font>

644
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,260
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to become like me?</font>

645
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,630
<font color="yellow">You always go by the book, and you're known as a man of integrity.</font>

646
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,430
<font color="yellow">You're like the most ideal public official.</font>

647
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,780
<font color="yellow">You even know how to butter up people now.</font>

648
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,370
<font color="yellow">Why did you decide to take the civil service exam?</font>

649
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,050
<font color="yellow">You used to be in a different line of work.</font>

650
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,580
<font color="yellow">Because of the stable monthly salary. Are we good now?</font>

651
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,120
<font color="yellow">What kind of work did you do before, then?</font>

652
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,690
<font color="yellow">Don't waste your time asking about useless things.</font>

653
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,020
<font color="yellow">Just take good care of the farmers participating in the festival.</font>

654
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,780
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

655
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,690
<font color="yellow">All public officials get seven dollars per each meal,</font>

656
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,780
<font color="yellow">but you ordered the large-sized portion.</font>

657
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,380
<font color="yellow">He's really something.</font>

658
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,680
<font color="yellow">This one is much better.</font>

659
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,650
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

660
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,490
<font color="yellow">I'm here to take a look at kitchen supplies, as well.</font>

661
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,530
<font color="yellow">Do you really think this one is better?</font>

662
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,490
<font color="yellow">Yes. It suits your kitchen much better.</font>

663
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,750
<font color="yellow">Okay. It's so convenient to have someone who decides things for me.</font>

664
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,280
<font color="yellow">I have good taste.</font>

665
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,950
<font color="yellow">Well, did you get my text?</font>

666
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,220
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

667
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I sincerely apologise.</font>

668
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,020
<font color="yellow">Well, it actually didn't upset me too much.</font>

669
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,450
<font color="yellow">But I wasn't thrilled, either.</font>

670
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,020
<font color="yellow">What is it, then?</font>

671
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,120
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying that it's better than having...</font>

672
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,850
<font color="yellow">nothing happen.</font>

673
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,850
<font color="yellow">Why did you decide to take the civil service exam?</font>

674
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,050
<font color="yellow">What kind of work did you do before, then?</font>

675
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,050
<font color="yellow">Hurry up! Get out of here now!</font>

676
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,450
<font color="yellow">Don't let go of my hand!</font>

677
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,250
<font color="yellow">(Operating Room)</font>

678
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,150
<font color="yellow">Thank you for today.</font>

679
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,620
<font color="yellow">You picked out the dishes for me...</font>

680
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,450
<font color="yellow">- and carried them for me, as well.
-  It's my pleasure.</font>

681
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,450
<font color="yellow">I hope every day can be like today.</font>

682
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,550
<font color="yellow">Then I'll think of you...</font>

683
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,080
<font color="yellow">like a little brother and talk casually to you now.</font>

684
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,150
<font color="yellow">Then we'll become close more quickly.</font>

685
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,650
<font color="yellow">You should go in.</font>

686
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,550
<font color="yellow">Hey, Eun Ho. Look.</font>

687
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,050
<font color="yellow">Isn't this such a great purchase?</font>

688
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,820
<font color="yellow">I picked it out for you.</font>

689
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,490
<font color="yellow">I have good taste.</font>

690
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,650
<font color="yellow">- Come in, guys.
-  Look at the actor here.</font>

691
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,420
<font color="yellow">There we go.</font>

692
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,990
<font color="yellow">What are all those?</font>

693
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,720
<font color="yellow">The farmers who are participating in the festival sent them for us...</font>

694
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,250
<font color="yellow">to taste the grapes to thank us.</font>

695
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,780
<font color="yellow">Return them immediately.</font>

696
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,450
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me?
-  If you want to taste them,</font>

697
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,240
<font color="yellow">pay for them during the festival.</font>

698
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,880
<font color="yellow">How can you bring these here?</font>

699
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,490
<font color="yellow">Has he lost his mind or what?</font>

700
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,940
<font color="yellow">It's not like these cost tens of thousands of dollars.</font>

701
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,600
<font color="yellow">We carried them all the way here.</font>

702
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,470
<font color="yellow">Return them to the farmers right away.</font>

703
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:40,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, sure thing.</font>

704
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,450
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up.
-  Goodness.</font>

705
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,340
<font color="yellow">Grape Festival?</font>

706
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,830
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's organised by Woori City,</font>

707
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,620
<font color="yellow">and they want to invite the actor.</font>

708
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,840
<font color="yellow">So what's been decided?</font>

709
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,740
<font color="yellow">He has a shoot around there anyway,</font>

710
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,350
<font color="yellow">so he'll stop by the event and do an autograph signing.</font>

711
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,010
<font color="yellow">He'll also participate in the grape stomping event.</font>

712
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,080
<font color="yellow">- He'll do that?
-  Yes.</font>

713
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,380
<font color="yellow">- That's awesome.
-  Producer Gang!</font>

714
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,260
<font color="yellow">My surname is Kang, not Gang.</font>

715
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,550
<font color="yellow">Well, you're as ruthless as a gangster when it comes to scripts.</font>

716
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,330
<font color="yellow">I heard the bad news, though.</font>

717
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,740
<font color="yellow">Because of the plagiarism incident,</font>

718
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,410
<font color="yellow">I heard you got transferred to the strategic planning team.</font>

719
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,550
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

720
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,500
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your hard work with Mr Han.</font>

721
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,800
<font color="yellow">You can talk to me from now on.</font>

722
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,820
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

723
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,320
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why do we keep running into each other?</font>

724
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,340
<font color="yellow">If you patronise me again,</font>

725
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,870
<font color="yellow">I'm transferring to another broadcasting station.</font>

726
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,720
<font color="yellow">You'll be patronised at other places if you don't change.</font>

727
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,100
<font color="yellow">How could you say something so offensive that easily?</font>

728
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,760
<font color="yellow">The emotions of the female character are fake.</font>

729
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,250
<font color="yellow">- It just doesn't make sense.
-  You've never dated, have you?</font>

730
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,610
<font color="yellow">You aren't dating now, are you?</font>

731
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,080
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since you've dated, right?</font>

732
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,220
<font color="yellow">That's why you say such a thing.</font>

733
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,250
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

734
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,720
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

735
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,580
<font color="yellow">Min Joo, are you getting off work?</font>

736
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,120
<font color="yellow">Wow, he's so handsome.</font>

737
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,980
<font color="yellow">Is that a camping vehicle everyone dreams of?</font>

738
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

739
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,150
<font color="yellow">He's...</font>

740
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,400
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm so impeccable.</font>

741
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,650
<font color="yellow">I know exactly when to appear.</font>

742
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,380
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring this car?</font>

743
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,860
<font color="yellow">Are you speaking to me casually now?</font>

744
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,060
<font color="yellow">Does it make you uncomfortable?</font>

745
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,120
<font color="yellow">No, I like how friendly it sounds.</font>

746
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,200
<font color="yellow">You asked me where to find ingredients.</font>

747
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,660
<font color="yellow">Today's the day.</font>

748
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,400
<font color="yellow">Can we also get ingredients that have strange names?</font>

749
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,420
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

750
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,150
<font color="yellow">Why do we need this car when we're shopping for groceries?</font>

751
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,860
<font color="yellow">This is for work.</font>

752
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,420
<font color="yellow">I've travelled all over the country with this car.</font>

753
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,370
<font color="yellow">A wanderer who stays at other people's houses?</font>

754
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,380
<font color="yellow">You could say that.</font>

755
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,520
<font color="yellow">Look at him with his family.</font>

756
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,550
<font color="yellow">You mean Sang Sik?</font>

757
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,080
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

758
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,020
<font color="yellow">We go on a trip together sometimes.</font>

759
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,150
<font color="yellow">Do you want to join?</font>

760
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,150
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

761
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,650
<font color="yellow">Where's the market?</font>

762
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,450
<font color="yellow">We're almost there.</font>

763
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,800
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much.</font>

764
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,550
<font color="yellow">Once customers find out about you through this festival,</font>

765
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,220
<font color="yellow">you'll be able to sell other related items.</font>

766
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,440
<font color="yellow">We're also making long-term plans,</font>

767
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,400
<font color="yellow">so it's important to make the festival successful.</font>

768
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,880
<font color="yellow">Without this festival, we would have thrown away all these grapes.</font>

769
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,540
<font color="yellow">We'll trust and follow you.</font>

770
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,010
<font color="yellow">Please help us out.</font>

771
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,650
<font color="yellow">You're the ones helping me out.</font>

772
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,820
<font color="yellow">Come on, Ma'am.</font>

773
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,420
<font color="yellow">Show us the ones you've hidden.</font>

774
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,150
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

775
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,980
<font color="yellow">I'll sell these first.</font>

776
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,220
<font color="yellow">Didn't your granddaughter like the cake I baked?</font>

777
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,220
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

778
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,120
<font color="yellow">Wait a moment.</font>

779
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,420
<font color="yellow">You're so good.</font>

780
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,520
<font color="yellow">These dates with seeds are sweeter and tastier.</font>

781
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,880
<font color="yellow">Dates?</font>

782
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,920
<font color="yellow">It's a dried date.</font>

783
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,320
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

784
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,660
<font color="yellow">This is the one.</font>

785
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,050
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

786
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,420
<font color="yellow">Oh, isn't she pretty?</font>

787
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,980
<font color="yellow">Is she your aunt?</font>

788
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,380
<font color="yellow">How can you sell a lot when you say things like that?</font>

789
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko.</font>

790
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,580
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

791
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,620
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

792
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,420
<font color="yellow">It's a photo that proves we're working outside.</font>

793
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,150
<font color="yellow">You look great in that hat.</font>

794
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,350
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

795
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,080
<font color="yellow">Focus on your work.</font>

796
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,340
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko, try this. It's so delicious.</font>

797
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,450
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

798
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,590
<font color="yellow">You told me to check everything.</font>

799
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,780
<font color="yellow">You have to try it to know it's the best quality.</font>

800
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,450
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

801
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,850
<font color="yellow">The skin is more nutritious.</font>

802
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,130
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

803
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,390
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko, come over here.</font>

804
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,420
<font color="yellow">What is it this time?</font>

805
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,130
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

806
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,850
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

807
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,630
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

808
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,880
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

809
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,450
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see the valve?</font>

810
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,620
<font color="yellow">I can't see anything.</font>

811
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,080
<font color="yellow">Move out of the way.</font>

812
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,920
<font color="yellow">- Move out of the way.
-  How nice.</font>

813
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,120
<font color="yellow">It's so refreshing.</font>

814
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,120
<font color="yellow">What's going on? What are you doing?</font>

815
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,750
<font color="yellow">You already turned it off.</font>

816
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,780
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

817
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,820
<font color="yellow">Oh, no, you're all wet.</font>

818
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,660
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it really refreshing, though?</font>

819
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,320
<font color="yellow">It was very refreshing.</font>

820
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,300
<font color="yellow">Aren't you too wet?</font>

821
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,020
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at?</font>

822
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,380
<font color="yellow">I didn't look at anything.</font>

823
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,940
<font color="yellow">She's so exhausting.</font>

824
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,580
<font color="yellow">I'm playing hard to get right now.</font>

825
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,150
<font color="yellow">What's with the face?</font>

826
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,400
<font color="yellow">"It's natural for an older woman to like a handsome young man."</font>

827
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,510
<font color="yellow">Is that why?</font>

828
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,780
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that?</font>

829
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,520
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I won't refer to you as an older woman.</font>

830
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,090
<font color="yellow">I'm an old lady.</font>

831
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,450
<font color="yellow">Old lady? That's not bad. It sounds quite friendly.</font>

832
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,220
<font color="yellow">Someone must really want to talk to you.</font>

833
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,000
<font color="yellow">Is it your girlfriend?</font>

834
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,580
<font color="yellow">I hate being misunderstood.</font>

835
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,150
<font color="yellow">I'm popular, but I don't date two people at once.</font>

836
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,090
<font color="yellow">I don't think two people would suffice for you.</font>

837
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,750
<font color="yellow">I only like one person right now.</font>

838
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,580
<font color="yellow">If you continue, it'll get uncomfortable between us.</font>

839
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,120
<font color="yellow">Why will it be uncomfortable?</font>

840
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,150
<font color="yellow">It's a teacher and student relationship.</font>

841
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,260
<font color="yellow">I'm teaching you how to cook.</font>

842
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,780
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

843
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,080
<font color="yellow">Does that mean there will be a difference in status, too?</font>

844
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,920
<font color="yellow">Then there's too many obstacles between us.</font>

845
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,950
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

846
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,920
<font color="yellow">Do you take the bus here?</font>

847
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

848
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,420
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko.</font>

849
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,720
<font color="yellow">How do I look?</font>

850
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,150
<font color="yellow">The hat is a little too big.</font>

851
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,420
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

852
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,250
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko.</font>

853
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,120
<font color="yellow">When you interviewed me,</font>

854
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,010
<font color="yellow">what was your first impression of me?</font>

855
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,690
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask that?</font>

856
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,550
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious.</font>

857
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,820
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be...</font>

858
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,150
<font color="yellow">meticulous and hard-working.</font>

859
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,480
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about that.</font>

860
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,730
<font color="yellow">Did I seem cold, intelligent,</font>

861
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,950
<font color="yellow">or thoughtful? I'm talking about that kind of stuff.</font>

862
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,720
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

863
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,350
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be meticulous and smart.</font>

864
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,150
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

865
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,380
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

866
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,050
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

867
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,420
<font color="yellow">Hello, Song Yi.</font>

868
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,220
<font color="yellow">I like you, Chief Ko.</font>

869
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,880
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

870
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,860
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

871
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,050
<font color="yellow">Hello, you must be returning from somewhere.</font>

872
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,750
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  It's for the Grape Festival.</font>

873
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,380
<font color="yellow">We were preparing for it.</font>

874
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,570
<font color="yellow">Are you coming from somewhere?</font>

875
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,350
<font color="yellow">We went out to relax.</font>

876
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,820
<font color="yellow">Are you two on a date right now?</font>

877
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,150
<font color="yellow">Was she the employee who gave you a bouquet in front of your house?</font>

878
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,150
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

879
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,680
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

880
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:17,120
<font color="yellow">People might think you're dating someone your daughter's age.</font>

881
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:19,650
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

882
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,960
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

883
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,260
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

884
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,350
<font color="yellow">I thought you were on a date after receiving a bouquet.</font>

885
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,670
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a date. We were out for work.</font>

886
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,460
<font color="yellow">You seemed quite close.</font>

887
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,120
<font color="yellow">Speak for yourself.</font>

888
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,510
<font color="yellow">Me? What about me?</font>

889
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,620
<font color="yellow">Come on, Sang Sik.</font>

890
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,450
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

891
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,850
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with spending time with someone like her?</font>

892
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,570
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
-  She's not underage.</font>

893
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,560
<font color="yellow">She confessed her love to you by giving you a bouquet.</font>

894
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,320
<font color="yellow">Who would I date at my age?</font>

895
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,420
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that age? Why isn't it possible?</font>

896
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,420
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

897
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,940
<font color="yellow">You can date if you like each other.</font>

898
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,950
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that?</font>

899
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,700
<font color="yellow">You're getting worse.</font>

900
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,680
<font color="yellow">Family is important, but your life is more so.</font>

901
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,520
<font color="yellow">- Don't you think?
-  Of course.</font>

902
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,550
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

903
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,610
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko, we checked all the received goods.</font>

904
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,620
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

905
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,150
<font color="yellow">Did you see the weather forecast?</font>

906
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,480
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

907
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,900
<font color="yellow">It's supposed to rain.</font>

908
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,510
<font color="yellow">Why would it rain when it's so sunny out?</font>

909
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,350
<font color="yellow">We don't know when it'll shower,</font>

910
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,890
<font color="yellow">so prepare the tents.</font>

911
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,020
<font color="yellow">Prepare enough raincoats and umbrellas, too.</font>

912
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,000
<font color="yellow">Here. Stick this on the back of your car.</font>

913
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,070
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

914
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,490
<font color="yellow">Chief Ko brought it for me to stick it on your car for free.</font>

915
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,250
<font color="yellow">I wanted to let you know.</font>

916
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,950
<font color="yellow">(This car was just washed. Keep a safe distance.)</font>
