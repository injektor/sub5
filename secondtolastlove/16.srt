<font color="yellow">bioskopkeren</font>

2
00:00:04,856 --> 00:00:07,756
<font color="yellow">Exactly. So let's talk about it inside!</font>

3
00:00:07,856 --> 00:00:09,556
<font color="yellow">- Let go! - What?</font>

4
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:10,926
<font color="yellow">Do you feel guilty?</font>

5
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:12,456
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

6
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:14,796
<font color="yellow">- Min Joo. - Ae Kyung.</font>

7
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,156
<font color="yellow">Ae Kyung.</font>

8
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:22,556
<font color="yellow">Richard?</font>

9
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:25,326
<font color="yellow">Richard?</font>

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,856
<font color="yellow">Now, you show your true colours!</font>

11
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,056
<font color="yellow">What? Richard?</font>

12
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:32,896
<font color="yellow">What? Richard?</font>

13
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:34,556
<font color="yellow">- He's my husband! - Stop it!</font>

14
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:36,326
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

15
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:39,326
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - I...</font>

16
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:42,326
<font color="yellow">Hey! Park Cheon Soo! Get over here.</font>

17
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:44,456
<font color="yellow">Let go! Let go!</font>

18
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:46,556
<font color="yellow">- Let go! - How could you?</font>

19
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:50,226
<font color="yellow">- Let go! - How could you?</font>

20
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:52,196
<font color="yellow">- You little... - Stop!</font>

21
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:54,996
<font color="yellow">- Let go! How could you do this? - Stop it.</font>

22
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:56,826
<font color="yellow">Let go! Let go!</font>

23
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:59,026
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to me?</font>

24
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,756
<font color="yellow">Are you insane? What's wrong with you?</font>

25
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:04,896
<font color="yellow">Who's calling whom insane? The two of you are insane.</font>

26
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:08,026
<font color="yellow">How dare you have an affair!</font>

27
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:09,996
<font color="yellow">An affair?</font>

28
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:13,126
<font color="yellow">An affair?</font>

29
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,356
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

30
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,856
<font color="yellow">I'm going to lose my mind.</font>

31
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:27,196
<font color="yellow">(Second to Last Love)</font>

32
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,656
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

33
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:35,026
<font color="yellow">Are the two of you really married?</font>

34
00:01:36,856 --> 00:01:37,856
<font color="yellow">Explain yourself.</font>

35
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:41,126
<font color="yellow">- That's not it. - Say it!</font>

36
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:44,826
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

37
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:50,456
<font color="yellow">But please hear me out.</font>

38
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:51,596
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

39
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:54,496
<font color="yellow">You've been staying out all night all the time after working out.</font>

40
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:56,496
<font color="yellow">How...</font>

41
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:59,126
<font color="yellow">How many times...</font>

42
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:03,626
<font color="yellow">This is a misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding.</font>

43
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:05,226
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a misunderstanding.</font>

44
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:08,026
<font color="yellow">We only met a few times to talk.</font>

45
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:11,256
<font color="yellow">All we did was talk. Nothing more.</font>

46
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:12,756
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

47
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:16,456
<font color="yellow">And I had no idea he was your husband.</font>

48
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:20,196
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have met a married man, had I known. I'm not crazy.</font>

49
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,196
<font color="yellow">Say something!</font>

50
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:24,656
<font color="yellow">You pretended to be single?</font>

51
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:32,026
<font color="yellow">I'm worried.</font>

52
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,826
<font color="yellow">How could this happen right after moving her stuff back in?</font>

53
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:38,226
<font color="yellow">How could Cheon Soo meet Ms Kang's friend, of all people?</font>

54
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:39,526
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

55
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,596
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they were just acquaintances.</font>

56
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,356
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there was a misunderstanding.</font>

57
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:47,156
<font color="yellow">That's right. What was it that you wanted to tell me?</font>

58
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:49,026
<font color="yellow">What did you leave in the comic book?</font>

59
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:52,626
<font color="yellow">Did you read the comic book?</font>

60
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:54,926
<font color="yellow">A little.</font>

61
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:56,356
<font color="yellow">Did you feel anything?</font>

62
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:57,526
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

63
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:01,456
<font color="yellow">Did you feel anything flutter here...</font>

64
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,196
<font color="yellow">or ache or something?</font>

65
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:04,856
<font color="yellow">Don't make me laugh.</font>

66
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,626
<font color="yellow">It's not like you drew it, so why?</font>

67
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:08,596
<font color="yellow">It's because it's similar to us.</font>

68
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:10,996
<font color="yellow">Like us? The comic book?</font>

69
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:12,956
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Don't read it if you didn't yet.</font>

70
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:14,996
<font color="yellow">Don't ever read it. Don't you dare, okay?</font>

71
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:16,726
<font color="yellow">He's so annoying.</font>

72
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:25,526
<font color="yellow">You still see me as a kid, don't you?</font>

73
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:32,396
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

74
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:39,056
<font color="yellow">I really didn't know.</font>

75
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:42,796
<font color="yellow">I never saw him here, so how would I have known?</font>

76
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:44,696
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

77
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,896
<font color="yellow">How could he act single?</font>

78
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,396
<font color="yellow">You said...</font>

79
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,126
<font color="yellow">you went to a hotel.</font>

80
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:52,626
<font color="yellow">You talked about...</font>

81
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:54,856
<font color="yellow">how he was too naive and you didn't want to be his first love.</font>

82
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,056
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

83
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,326
<font color="yellow">I'm shocked, too.</font>

84
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:02,096
<font color="yellow">But we didn't do it. I sent him home that night.</font>

85
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:04,796
<font color="yellow">Good going. Good for you.</font>

86
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:08,196
<font color="yellow">How could a teacher...</font>

87
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:09,696
<font color="yellow">A teacher?</font>

88
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:11,426
<font color="yellow">He's a teacher?</font>

89
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,626
<font color="yellow">You should've done your research!</font>

90
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,796
<font color="yellow">How humiliating.</font>

91
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,526
<font color="yellow">Please believe me.</font>

92
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,226
<font color="yellow">It's not the type of relationship that you're thinking.</font>

93
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:25,956
<font color="yellow">Then why did you see her?</font>

94
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:30,426
<font color="yellow">Why did you pretend to be single and lie about your job to meet her?</font>

95
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:32,296
<font color="yellow">A companion.</font>

96
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:34,956
<font color="yellow">Because I didn't have a life companion.</font>

97
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:36,226
<font color="yellow">A companion?</font>

98
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:39,456
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind? What about my sister, Sang Hee?</font>

99
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:41,656
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

100
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:44,996
<font color="yellow">people say spouses are your life companion,</font>

101
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:47,096
<font color="yellow">but it isn't always true.</font>

102
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,426
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

103
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:50,826
<font color="yellow">People like you would never understand,</font>

104
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:52,156
<font color="yellow">but the truth is,</font>

105
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,596
<font color="yellow">many married couples out there...</font>

106
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:56,656
<font color="yellow">aren't each other's companions.</font>

107
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,896
<font color="yellow">It's not even like they are couples with problems.</font>

108
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:02,626
<font color="yellow">There are so many couples...</font>

109
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:05,596
<font color="yellow">who hide things from each other and are just a façade.</font>

110
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:06,656
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

111
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:10,226
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you and Sang Hee are nothing but a façade?</font>

112
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:11,426
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

113
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,526
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

114
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:15,626
<font color="yellow">A life companion...</font>

115
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:19,896
<font color="yellow">should be someone you can discuss your life with.</font>

116
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:22,596
<font color="yellow">If that's your spouse, that's awesome.</font>

117
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,226
<font color="yellow">But it doesn't always have to be your spouse.</font>

118
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:28,726
<font color="yellow">It can be someone else. That's what I'm saying.</font>

119
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:31,226
<font color="yellow">It can be a friend of the opposite sex...</font>

120
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:33,096
<font color="yellow">or a friend of the same sex.</font>

121
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:35,696
<font color="yellow">Like a soul mate.</font>

122
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:36,896
<font color="yellow">Devote yourself to your family.</font>

123
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,726
<font color="yellow">Whether it be soul mate or companion,</font>

124
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:40,796
<font color="yellow">you should create it within your family.</font>

125
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:43,456
<font color="yellow">Then are Ye Ji, Mi Rae...</font>

126
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:46,426
<font color="yellow">and my wife your life companions?</font>

127
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,956
<font color="yellow">They have their own lives. What about you?</font>

128
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,296
<font color="yellow">We're talking about you. Why are you dragging me into this?</font>

129
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:55,756
<font color="yellow">A life companion walking on the same path...</font>

130
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:58,596
<font color="yellow">and with whom you can talk about life.</font>

131
00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:01,056
<font color="yellow">I did it because I didn't have anyone like that.</font>

132
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,296
<font color="yellow">It's been a while...</font>

133
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:06,156
<font color="yellow">since I couldn't talk to Sang Hee.</font>

134
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:10,496
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you were right?</font>

135
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:14,096
<font color="yellow">No, I was wrong.</font>

136
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,156
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

137
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:08,356
<font color="yellow">My friend really didn't know and make a huge mistake.</font>

138
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,456
<font color="yellow">I'm terribly sorry.</font>

139
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,056
<font color="yellow">I... I'm sorry.</font>

140
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:21,926
<font color="yellow">I'm flabbergasted, too.</font>

141
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:23,396
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

142
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:26,396
<font color="yellow">You're older than I am.</font>

143
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:29,226
<font color="yellow">You took very good care of yourself.</font>

144
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:32,896
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

145
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:37,856
<font color="yellow">I don't know how much I should believe about your relationship.</font>

146
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:42,456
<font color="yellow">Anyway, about grabbing your friend's hair...</font>

147
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:46,796
<font color="yellow">If you're ever in my shoes, you'll understand.</font>

148
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:49,026
<font color="yellow">Of course. I understand already.</font>

149
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:52,626
<font color="yellow">Whether or not my friend knew, she was definitely wrong.</font>

150
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:54,456
<font color="yellow">It's her fault for not knowing.</font>

151
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:56,726
<font color="yellow">- I'll talk to her. - Min Joo.</font>

152
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,326
<font color="yellow">They'll never see each other again.</font>

153
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:05,556
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

154
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,856
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Go home.</font>

155
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:13,226
<font color="yellow">Kang Min Joo.</font>

156
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,996
<font color="yellow">- What? - I'm happy...</font>

157
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,356
<font color="yellow">that you moved back in too, but you can't do this to me.</font>

158
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:23,556
<font color="yellow">- What? - I know Sang Sik is important,</font>

159
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:26,826
<font color="yellow">but your friend just got fooled by his brother-in-law.</font>

160
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:29,626
<font color="yellow">How do you not care at all about me?</font>

161
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:31,056
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

162
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:33,596
<font color="yellow">Did I kill someone or what?</font>

163
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:35,356
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

164
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:36,896
<font color="yellow">I'm the one...</font>

165
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:39,156
<font color="yellow">who should get an apology from that family.</font>

166
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:42,826
<font color="yellow">And you shouldn't get angry at me, but at that family.</font>

167
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,726
<font color="yellow">A friend was victimised like this,</font>

168
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:48,826
<font color="yellow">but you get mad at me and make my apologise?</font>

169
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,196
<font color="yellow">- No... - Forget it!</font>

170
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:55,126
<font color="yellow">Women don't care at all about friendship.</font>

171
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:57,626
<font color="yellow">Their man is all they care about.</font>

172
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,156
<font color="yellow">Ae Kyung!</font>

173
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:18,466
<font color="yellow">You don't talk to me at all.</font>

174
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,756
<font color="yellow">What did you like so much about her?</font>

175
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:25,326
<font color="yellow">She's a wingless angel?</font>

176
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:28,196
<font color="yellow">And I'm a house ghost?</font>

177
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:33,156
<font color="yellow">Hey, Park Cheon Soo! Live with a human being.</font>

178
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,526
<font color="yellow">Why do you live with a ghost and sleep with an angel?</font>

179
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:41,696
<font color="yellow">Who slept with whom?</font>

180
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:45,426
<font color="yellow">You treat me like a piece of furniture.</font>

181
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:49,356
<font color="yellow">Conversation? You turn your back to me every time I start talking.</font>

182
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:50,996
<font color="yellow">You bled me dry.</font>

183
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:53,526
<font color="yellow">How good were you to that woman?</font>

184
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,926
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to a human being.</font>

185
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:58,296
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to a human being, too.</font>

186
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,466
<font color="yellow">Do I speak in a foreign language?</font>

187
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:02,226
<font color="yellow">I want someone I can communicate with...</font>

188
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:03,726
<font color="yellow">and relate to...</font>

189
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:04,726
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

190
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,056
<font color="yellow">I'm a human being, too.</font>

191
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:09,426
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

192
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,466
<font color="yellow">I'm a human being, too.</font>

193
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:15,556
<font color="yellow">How did I live all these years trying to support you?</font>

194
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:18,196
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stand it when you sold drugs...</font>

195
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:21,826
<font color="yellow">on behalf of the principal's wife.</font>

196
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:25,756
<font color="yellow">It hurts my reputation at school, and it's humiliating.</font>

197
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:27,996
<font color="yellow">And the summers, too.</font>

198
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,296
<font color="yellow">Just so you can make a few bucks,</font>

199
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:32,696
<font color="yellow">you rent out our house...</font>

200
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:35,556
<font color="yellow">and make our family live in tents in your brother's yard.</font>

201
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,226
<font color="yellow">It's sickening!</font>

202
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:41,696
<font color="yellow">Do you think I want to live like this?</font>

203
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:44,926
<font color="yellow">The more you do things like that to save money,</font>

204
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:47,226
<font color="yellow">the worse you make me feel!</font>

205
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:53,726
<font color="yellow">We should live...</font>

206
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:55,726
<font color="yellow">according to what we have.</font>

207
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,226
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about...</font>

208
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:00,296
<font color="yellow">sending Hoon to study abroad.</font>

209
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:08,796
<font color="yellow">Sang Hee.</font>

210
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:12,156
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

211
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:17,796
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

212
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:23,096
<font color="yellow">I thought giving up my dreams...</font>

213
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:28,626
<font color="yellow">and supporting my family what the right thing to do.</font>

214
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,496
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

215
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:38,096
<font color="yellow">How did it end up like this?</font>

216
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:45,926
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

217
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,396
<font color="yellow">Did your friend really not know?</font>

218
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,226
<font color="yellow">Would she have done that if she knew?</font>

219
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,926
<font color="yellow">She may have gotten married and divorced at a young age,</font>

220
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,856
<font color="yellow">but she knows what's right and wrong.</font>

221
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,496
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your brother-in-law?</font>

222
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:06,226
<font color="yellow">He isn't the type to do something like this.</font>

223
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:10,156
<font color="yellow">Regardless, he lied to her about his job and his marriage.</font>

224
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,496
<font color="yellow">My friend was the victim.</font>

225
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:15,356
<font color="yellow">After all we went through to get back together,</font>

226
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:17,556
<font color="yellow">must we argue about something like this?</font>

227
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:21,856
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

228
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:25,096
<font color="yellow">How's your friend doing?</font>

229
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:29,296
<font color="yellow">She was angry and disappointed in me.</font>

230
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:31,226
<font color="yellow">In you?</font>

231
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:34,126
<font color="yellow">She said I didn't understand how she felt when I'm her friend.</font>

232
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,756
<font color="yellow">I must have talked like I was a part of your family.</font>

233
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:40,396
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

234
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:47,856
<font color="yellow">Why did he do it...</font>

235
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,426
<font color="yellow">when he has such a nice wife?</font>

236
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:53,656
<font color="yellow">There must be a void that Sang Hee can't fill.</font>

237
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,596
<font color="yellow">Still, they're married.</font>

238
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:58,496
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

239
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,026
<font color="yellow">She may be my sister,</font>

240
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,756
<font color="yellow">but I'm sure there was a problem with Sang Hee, too.</font>

241
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,756
<font color="yellow">The man cheated.</font>

242
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,326
<font color="yellow">Why do you think something was wrong with the woman?</font>

243
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:14,826
<font color="yellow">He's the one at fault. He made a fool out of two women.</font>

244
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,426
<font color="yellow">Of course, he was wrong...</font>

245
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:19,826
<font color="yellow">since he lied about who he was.</font>

246
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:23,456
<font color="yellow">But it wouldn't have come to this if Sang Hee had been better.</font>

247
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:26,496
<font color="yellow">You'll never find someone more devoted to her family.</font>

248
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:28,326
<font color="yellow">She gave up her dreams...</font>

249
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:30,796
<font color="yellow">and devoted herself to her family.</font>

250
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,356
<font color="yellow">I didn't think so before,</font>

251
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:37,826
<font color="yellow">but maybe you're a bit of a macho man.</font>

252
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:41,326
<font color="yellow">A macho man?</font>

253
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:47,226
<font color="yellow">They say affairs late in life are scarier.</font>

254
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,226
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid that I'd cheat?</font>

255
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,926
<font color="yellow">Who knows? All men are the same.</font>

256
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:55,196
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

257
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:58,796
<font color="yellow">How's the house?</font>

258
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:01,026
<font color="yellow">I arranged it the best I could,</font>

259
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,196
<font color="yellow">but if you don't like it, we can redo it.</font>

260
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:05,096
<font color="yellow">No, I really like it.</font>

261
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,756
<font color="yellow">You did such a good job.</font>

262
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:10,296
<font color="yellow">It was like a surprise event.</font>

263
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:13,426
<font color="yellow">This was the only thing I could do for you at this time.</font>

264
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:16,726
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

265
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:20,156
<font color="yellow">for showing me how you felt first.</font>

266
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:23,796
<font color="yellow">Please talk to your friend about my sister.</font>

267
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,956
<font color="yellow">Tell her that she'll apologise in person later.</font>

268
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:32,056
<font color="yellow">Married life doesn't seem that easy, either.</font>

269
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,156
<font color="yellow">But if two people like each other,</font>

270
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:37,656
<font color="yellow">it's better to get married and live together than to live alone.</font>

271
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:46,826
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

272
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,456
<font color="yellow">Anyway, don't think about going anywhere again,</font>

273
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,626
<font color="yellow">and stay here, okay?</font>

274
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:56,696
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

275
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:14,056
<font color="yellow">He didn't just propose, did he?</font>

276
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:30,456
<font color="yellow">Where should I put this?</font>

277
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,956
<font color="yellow">Put it there.</font>

278
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,426
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

279
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:37,826
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

280
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,326
<font color="yellow">You look extremely happy right now.</font>

281
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:40,596
<font color="yellow">You're like...</font>

282
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:42,356
<font color="yellow">a newly-wed decorating his house.</font>

283
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:44,356
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

284
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,626
<font color="yellow">You look good.</font>

285
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:47,656
<font color="yellow">Don't lose her again, okay?</font>

286
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:50,496
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thanks.</font>

287
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,996
<font color="yellow">We're almost done. We should clean up now.</font>

288
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:55,226
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

289
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,356
<font color="yellow">Cheon Soo really messed up big this time.</font>

290
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:07,656
<font color="yellow">How is Sang Hee doing?</font>

291
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,296
<font color="yellow">She's a total wreck.</font>

292
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,096
<font color="yellow">What were you doing?</font>

293
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:12,626
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

294
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:15,656
<font color="yellow">(Houses for sale)</font>

295
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:17,296
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

296
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,596
<font color="yellow">I was just looking at some places. What?</font>

297
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:20,896
<font color="yellow">Are you really moving out?</font>

298
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,896
<font color="yellow">I'm just looking around.</font>

299
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:26,656
<font color="yellow">I'm just looking around.</font>

300
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:32,926
<font color="yellow">How's Sang Sik?</font>

301
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:35,456
<font color="yellow">He's energetic as always.</font>

302
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,396
<font color="yellow">He blocked that hail storm...</font>

303
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,226
<font color="yellow">with his body on that cruise, remember?</font>

304
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:44,056
<font color="yellow">Exactly. Blame it on the cruise ship,</font>

305
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:47,456
<font color="yellow">and make sure the production fee stays the same.</font>

306
00:16:47,726 --> 00:16:49,756
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's been set up already.</font>

307
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:52,296
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

308
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:58,196
<font color="yellow">The ship was damaged by the hail storm.</font>

309
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,926
<font color="yellow">You had it renovated immediately before the drama was announced.</font>

310
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:02,926
<font color="yellow">It was constructed poorly,</font>

311
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,996
<font color="yellow">so it had many flaws even before the renovations.</font>

312
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:08,056
<font color="yellow">We looked over the documents you submitted.</font>

313
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,956
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin blamed the contractor.</font>

314
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:14,596
<font color="yellow">If they had met the standards required,</font>

315
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:17,726
<font color="yellow">the windows would not have broken or cracked from the hail.</font>

316
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:20,126
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin isn't an expert,</font>

317
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:22,696
<font color="yellow">so it is difficult to judge whether cheap glass...</font>

318
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:24,626
<font color="yellow">or strong glass were used.</font>

319
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:26,226
<font color="yellow">Then I guess...</font>

320
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:28,756
<font color="yellow">you mean you need further proof or witnesses.</font>

321
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,126
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

322
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:33,396
<font color="yellow">But you undertook the renovations recently,</font>

323
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:35,226
<font color="yellow">and the ship was damaged due to the hail.</font>

324
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,926
<font color="yellow">We can't help but hold you accountable.</font>

325
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:41,226
<font color="yellow">- What? - And the fact that you rushed...</font>

326
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,026
<font color="yellow">renovations before the drama announcement...</font>

327
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,496
<font color="yellow">makes us question your relationship with SBC's Kang Min Joo, as well.</font>

328
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,726
<font color="yellow">The announcement event...</font>

329
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,596
<font color="yellow">was intended to raise awareness of the cruise ship...</font>

330
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,526
<font color="yellow">that was being wasted.</font>

331
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,296
<font color="yellow">What is your relationship with Ms Kang Min Joo?</font>

332
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:58,356
<font color="yellow">Is there something special?</font>

333
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:01,226
<font color="yellow">Something special?</font>

334
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,556
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

335
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,826
<font color="yellow">I'm asking if your relationship is strictly professional,</font>

336
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,196
<font color="yellow">or if it involves personal emotions.</font>

337
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:13,356
<font color="yellow">Answer the question.</font>

338
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,796
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

339
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,096
<font color="yellow">She's the woman I love.</font>

340
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:25,926
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

341
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,796
<font color="yellow">How are preparations going?</font>

342
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:31,926
<font color="yellow">Of course. Don't worry. It's all going well.</font>

343
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:34,896
<font color="yellow">Woori City's drama production fee won't change.</font>

344
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:36,596
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

345
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:39,026
<font color="yellow">I worked hard to get that.</font>

346
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:41,226
<font color="yellow">So don't worry and proceed.</font>

347
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:44,026
<font color="yellow">Thank you. What's gotten into you?</font>

348
00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:45,626
<font color="yellow">Let's have some soju tonight.</font>

349
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:46,896
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

350
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:49,896
<font color="yellow">You agreed to have soju with me if I made sure the fee didn't change.</font>

351
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:52,456
<font color="yellow">I'm super busy. You know that.</font>

352
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,196
<font color="yellow">Why? Because of Sang Sik?</font>

353
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:59,166
<font color="yellow">He should be busy lately, being audited and all.</font>

354
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,126
<font color="yellow">Did you know that?</font>

355
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:04,356
<font color="yellow">Is it because of that article?</font>

356
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:06,626
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's because of you.</font>

357
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:08,596
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

358
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,166
<font color="yellow">You announced the drama on the ship.</font>

359
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:12,826
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

360
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:15,226
<font color="yellow">He's about to go on under because of that.</font>

361
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:19,696
<font color="yellow">I heard it looks like he'll tell the world that you two are dating.</font>

362
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:25,166
<font color="yellow">You should end it soon for his sake.</font>

363
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:31,556
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

364
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:33,126
<font color="yellow">Why? It's obvious.</font>

365
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:36,166
<font color="yellow">There's already a scandal about us conducting internal transactions.</font>

366
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:40,296
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

367
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,996
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Thank you...</font>

368
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:45,396
<font color="yellow">for setting the judgement straight for the drama evaluation.</font>

369
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:47,456
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it to be thanked.</font>

370
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:48,956
<font color="yellow">If you leave things like this,</font>

371
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:52,596
<font color="yellow">it'll be only natural that people think you let us use the ship...</font>

372
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,756
<font color="yellow">for the announcement and the shoots because of your feelings for me.</font>

373
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,996
<font color="yellow">Then how could I prove it isn't true?</font>

374
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,356
<font color="yellow">You should've said our relationship was purely professional.</font>

375
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:03,226
<font color="yellow">Why must I lie?</font>

376
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:04,426
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

377
00:20:05,526 --> 00:20:07,526
<font color="yellow">You're so stiff.</font>

378
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:10,056
<font color="yellow">We're next door neighbours.</font>

379
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:13,056
<font color="yellow">They can find that out just by running our addresses.</font>

380
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:15,126
<font color="yellow">They can frame me easily if they wanted to.</font>

381
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:17,526
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

382
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,726
<font color="yellow">you can give up on developing the cruise ship.</font>

383
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:21,496
<font color="yellow">If we sell the ship now,</font>

384
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:24,796
<font color="yellow">the corruption behind it will all be buried.</font>

385
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,326
<font color="yellow">That's what Mr Shin wants and why he wants to sell it.</font>

386
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:30,496
<font color="yellow">Our city must protect it.</font>

387
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:35,596
<font color="yellow">They should be investigating Mr Shin, not someone like...</font>

388
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:40,726
<font color="yellow">It's nice having someone on my side.</font>

389
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:45,056
<font color="yellow">Then all I can do to help...</font>

390
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:47,926
<font color="yellow">is to take less for the production fee.</font>

391
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,456
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

392
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:51,296
<font color="yellow">Everyone worked hard for that.</font>

393
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:52,696
<font color="yellow">Then what?</font>

394
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:54,196
<font color="yellow">There are no answers in life.</font>

395
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:57,456
<font color="yellow">I don't like the fact that someone like you is even suspected.</font>

396
00:20:57,896 --> 00:21:00,126
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Why? You're not like them.</font>

397
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,296
<font color="yellow">It's also not the truth.</font>

398
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:05,626
<font color="yellow">Are those the only reasons?</font>

399
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:18,126
<font color="yellow">Because I like you.</font>

400
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:20,496
<font color="yellow">Happy?</font>

401
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:29,326
<font color="yellow">Then what happens to Chief Ko?</font>

402
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,196
<font color="yellow">He'll take the blame all by himself.</font>

403
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:35,226
<font color="yellow">Our team may be gone overnight, too.</font>

404
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:37,696
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

405
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,666
<font color="yellow">Song Yi, why aren't you eating?</font>

406
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:42,896
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

407
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:46,296
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - What is it?</font>

408
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:48,796
<font color="yellow">It's because of Chief Ko's scandal.</font>

409
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,626
<font color="yellow">But it's true that they're dating.</font>

410
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,756
<font color="yellow">- With Ms Kang Min Joo? - Yes.</font>

411
00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:57,726
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have gone to the movies with Chief Ko.</font>

412
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:00,056
<font color="yellow">You watched a movie with him?</font>

413
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,896
<font color="yellow">What was the point?</font>

414
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:04,956
<font color="yellow">He ended it all right then.</font>

415
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,596
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have pleaded him to go.</font>

416
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:11,396
<font color="yellow">I should've...</font>

417
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:13,856
<font color="yellow">fought my feelings and resisted.</font>

418
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:27,796
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

419
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:32,126
<font color="yellow">We're living apart for now.</font>

420
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:34,896
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

421
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:36,556
<font color="yellow">What about Hoon?</font>

422
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,556
<font color="yellow">He wants to stay at home with his dad.</font>

423
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:41,456
<font color="yellow">- Traitor. - Obviously, his home is better.</font>

424
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:42,826
<font color="yellow">Go back home.</font>

425
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,756
<font color="yellow">Hey, Sang Hee!</font>

426
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:50,496
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo, stop it.</font>

427
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:52,156
<font color="yellow">I told you that's not it.</font>

428
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:55,196
<font color="yellow">What is it this time?</font>

429
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:59,496
<font color="yellow">This punk says he's moving out.</font>

430
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:00,856
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - What?</font>

431
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:03,026
<font color="yellow">He's looking for a new place to live.</font>

432
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:06,456
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Why else? It's because of you.</font>

433
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:10,326
<font color="yellow">In case you'd be uncomfortable. So that you'd be happy.</font>

434
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,226
<font color="yellow">He's impossible.</font>

435
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:14,326
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

436
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,826
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is!</font>

437
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:17,626
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

438
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:20,926
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

439
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:23,096
<font color="yellow">Hey. Be quiet.</font>

440
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:24,396
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

441
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:28,656
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

442
00:23:36,156 --> 00:23:38,226
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, so don't worry about it.</font>

443
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,326
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's nothing?</font>

444
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:41,526
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

445
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:43,556
<font color="yellow">Why are you home so late?</font>

446
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,396
<font color="yellow">- Did you have dinner? - Yes, I did.</font>

447
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:47,656
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

448
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:51,596
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to Jun Woo.</font>

449
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,826
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Go in. - Okay, then.</font>

450
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:58,926
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

451
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:03,556
<font color="yellow">That jerk. Selfish jerk.</font>

452
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,356
<font color="yellow">He doesn't think about me at all.</font>

453
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:16,456
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to do this?</font>

454
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,756
<font color="yellow">That's not it. I'm really okay, but...</font>

455
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,226
<font color="yellow">But?</font>

456
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:25,656
<font color="yellow">What's the problem?</font>

457
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:28,826
<font color="yellow">What did you say to me right here when you came from Canada?</font>

458
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:32,226
<font color="yellow">When your appendix burst,</font>

459
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:34,396
<font color="yellow">what did you say to me at the hospital?</font>

460
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:37,496
<font color="yellow">The day I buried my wife,</font>

461
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:40,356
<font color="yellow">what did you say to me in the car?</font>

462
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:42,626
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

463
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:44,496
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

464
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:49,126
<font color="yellow">Did you or did you not say that we are family and will never part?</font>

465
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,196
<font color="yellow">Why don't you realise I'd be more uncomfortable if you leave?</font>

466
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:56,426
<font color="yellow">Look,</font>

467
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:58,826
<font color="yellow">I know I should leave for your sake, but...</font>

468
00:24:58,826 --> 00:24:59,996
<font color="yellow">That is not true.</font>

469
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:06,426
<font color="yellow">Fine. Okay.</font>

470
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,356
<font color="yellow">I wasn't thinking straight.</font>

471
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:11,496
<font color="yellow">I looked around a little,</font>

472
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,596
<font color="yellow">but I just couldn't give up this family.</font>

473
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:20,126
<font color="yellow">So even if I make you uncomfortable, bear with me.</font>

474
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:23,496
<font color="yellow">I'll keep wishing you happiness.</font>

475
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:25,726
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

476
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:28,096
<font color="yellow">You should've said that from the start.</font>

477
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:31,696
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously. I just can't win.</font>

478
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,426
<font color="yellow">I'm so sick of you all.</font>

479
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:39,496
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

480
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:09,756
<font color="yellow">Oh, wait.</font>

481
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:12,496
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

482
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:14,126
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

483
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:15,226
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

484
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:17,356
<font color="yellow">But seeing your face...</font>

485
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,656
<font color="yellow">is reminding me of it and making my blood boil again.</font>

486
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,056
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

487
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,226
<font color="yellow">If you're free, you should join me for breakfast.</font>

488
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:26,896
<font color="yellow">No. I have to go eat breakfast with my son, Hoon.</font>

489
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:28,556
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

490
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:30,696
<font color="yellow">See you!</font>

491
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:38,526
<font color="yellow">Hey, Tae Yeon.</font>

492
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:42,296
<font color="yellow">Ae Kyung told you, right?</font>

493
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:46,426
<font color="yellow">What? Today?</font>

494
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:48,996
<font color="yellow">You girls are meeting him today?</font>

495
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:51,226
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

496
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:57,826
<font color="yellow">I sincerely apologise for what my sister did to you.</font>

497
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:00,526
<font color="yellow">So you're basically saying that I should never see him again...</font>

498
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:03,196
<font color="yellow">and that I should stay far away from him, right?</font>

499
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,456
<font color="yellow">I can't make such a request because you two are friends.</font>

500
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:09,026
<font color="yellow">I'm just asking you not to visit for the next little while.</font>

501
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:12,596
<font color="yellow">You're still treating me as if I'm guilty of adultery.</font>

502
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:15,796
<font color="yellow">No, not at all. Cheon Soo is the one at fault, not you.</font>

503
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:18,596
<font color="yellow">Exactly. You had no idea.</font>

504
00:27:20,226 --> 00:27:21,226
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

505
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:24,596
<font color="yellow">Then let me say a few things as Min Joo's friend.</font>

506
00:27:25,756 --> 00:27:28,496
<font color="yellow">She's been completely fine alone so far.</font>

507
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:34,056
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that people might think badly of her because of me.</font>

508
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:37,796
<font color="yellow">I hope the incident doesn't affect your relationship. Be good to her.</font>

509
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:41,056
<font color="yellow">I will, of course. Thank you.</font>

510
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:45,626
<font color="yellow">And I'd like to thank you for telling me where her stuff was.</font>

511
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:46,856
<font color="yellow">Oh, that.</font>

512
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:50,056
<font color="yellow">Please make sure Min Joo doesn't run away again.</font>

513
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:52,126
<font color="yellow">You must love her with all of your heart, okay?</font>

514
00:27:52,956 --> 00:27:53,956
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

515
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:33,296
<font color="yellow">You probably don't know because you've never been married.</font>

516
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,556
<font color="yellow">I guess my wife and I are going through ennui.</font>

517
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,926
<font color="yellow">To be honest with you, I very much enjoy...</font>

518
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:43,596
<font color="yellow">spending time with Ae Kyung.</font>

519
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:47,156
<font color="yellow">Even if that is the case,</font>

520
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:50,896
<font color="yellow">your wife can't stand it...</font>

521
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,756
<font color="yellow">because it bothers her a lot,</font>

522
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:54,596
<font color="yellow">so you shouldn't spend time with her.</font>

523
00:28:55,596 --> 00:28:57,726
<font color="yellow">You make dramas.</font>

524
00:28:58,156 --> 00:29:00,696
<font color="yellow">Can't you empathise with what everyone goes through?</font>

525
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:02,456
<font color="yellow">That's usually the case,</font>

526
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:05,356
<font color="yellow">but this is reality. Besides,</font>

527
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:10,226
<font color="yellow">it involves my close friend.</font>

528
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,926
<font color="yellow">You're probably more worried about this affecting...</font>

529
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:15,796
<font color="yellow">your relationship with Sang Sik.</font>

530
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:21,496
<font color="yellow">Right. That I can't deny.</font>

531
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,456
<font color="yellow">Plus, I've become friends with Sang Hee, as well.</font>

532
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:28,156
<font color="yellow">I know. But you know what?</font>

533
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:31,096
<font color="yellow">I'm genuinely fond of her.</font>

534
00:29:32,296 --> 00:29:34,356
<font color="yellow">Ae Kyung and I have great conversations.</font>

535
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:36,556
<font color="yellow">We're friends, and I feel comfortable around her.</font>

536
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,826
<font color="yellow">Right, I get it.</font>

537
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:41,996
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

538
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:46,626
<font color="yellow">faithfulness is an important part of love.</font>

539
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:49,096
<font color="yellow">Faithfulness?</font>

540
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:53,426
<font color="yellow">Love that is all faithfulness and no love would be dreary, though.</font>

541
00:29:55,556 --> 00:29:57,096
<font color="yellow">Being faithful...</font>

542
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,696
<font color="yellow">requires a lot of love.</font>

543
00:30:01,226 --> 00:30:02,356
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

544
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:04,926
<font color="yellow">So you know.</font>

545
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:08,826
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

546
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:11,526
<font color="yellow">I'll try.</font>

547
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:24,656
<font color="yellow">Is there a different spot you can think of?</font>

548
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:28,426
<font color="yellow">The vehicle will have to spin as soon as it gets hit,</font>

549
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:30,326
<font color="yellow">so we need a wider space.</font>

550
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:31,696
<font color="yellow">This should be good enough, no?</font>

551
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:34,496
<font color="yellow">Does the scene have to look that spectacular?</font>

552
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:35,756
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me right now?</font>

553
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:37,726
<font color="yellow">This drama is for Woori City.</font>

554
00:30:40,056 --> 00:30:41,356
<font color="yellow">Oh, Producer Kang.</font>

555
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:42,826
<font color="yellow">The shoot hasn't begun yet?</font>

556
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,796
<font color="yellow">No. We're doing a run-through right now,</font>

557
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:46,056
<font color="yellow">but I don't like anything I see.</font>

558
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:49,096
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello. Thank you for your help.</font>

559
00:30:49,396 --> 00:30:53,956
<font color="yellow">Producer Nam and I decided on the location together.</font>

560
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:57,056
<font color="yellow">He wasn't happy with the original location,</font>

561
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,826
<font color="yellow">so we came here, and he's complaining again.</font>

562
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:02,396
<font color="yellow">- You made it. - Yes.</font>

563
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:04,496
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is seriously so ridiculous.</font>

564
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,556
<font color="yellow">Producer Kang, could you direct the shoot instead of him?</font>

565
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:09,726
<font color="yellow">When will the shoot start?</font>

566
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:12,226
<font color="yellow">You should've told us to arrive after you're ready.</font>

567
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:14,526
<font color="yellow">We've been waiting since very early in the morning.</font>

568
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:16,026
<font color="yellow">It's because this is the very first shoot.</font>

569
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:18,056
<font color="yellow">You two need to get comfortable with each other, so...</font>

570
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:19,896
<font color="yellow">Producer Nam, spare me a second.</font>

571
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:25,156
<font color="yellow">What did I say? We should've just started shooting.</font>

572
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:28,696
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

573
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,996
<font color="yellow">You don't need to apologise to me. Just do a good job.</font>

574
00:31:33,396 --> 00:31:36,596
<font color="yellow">If you're that unhappy with the location, I'll find something else.</font>

575
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,996
<font color="yellow">- Really? - That's what you need help with.</font>

576
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:44,696
<font color="yellow">Also, don't push yourself to do too well.</font>

577
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,156
<font color="yellow">How can I not? This isn't any drama.</font>

578
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:49,156
<font color="yellow">We got the project after intense competition.</font>

579
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:51,296
<font color="yellow">All eyes must be on us at the moment.</font>

580
00:31:51,856 --> 00:31:54,096
<font color="yellow">Besides, this is the first drama I'm directing.</font>

581
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:56,896
<font color="yellow">Right, so you've got to relax. Don't feel pressured to do too well.</font>

582
00:31:57,096 --> 00:31:59,226
<font color="yellow">Okay. When I get stressed out,</font>

583
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:01,026
<font color="yellow">I'll reach out to you for help.</font>

584
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:02,796
<font color="yellow">I hope that doesn't happen.</font>

585
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:04,996
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

586
00:32:05,496 --> 00:32:07,896
<font color="yellow">- just cancel today's shoot. - Sorry?</font>

587
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:10,396
<font color="yellow">If you push ahead with it in this situation,</font>

588
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,456
<font color="yellow">it won't turn out well.</font>

589
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,896
<font color="yellow">Ki Cheol, you're the captain and the person in charge here.</font>

590
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,656
<font color="yellow">In a few years,</font>

591
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:20,096
<font color="yellow">no one will even give you any advice like I'm doing now.</font>

592
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:23,126
<font color="yellow">You'll have to make your own decisions as you go along.</font>

593
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:25,396
<font color="yellow">Pull yourself together...</font>

594
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:27,856
<font color="yellow">and resume the shoot when you're actually ready.</font>

595
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:29,526
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

596
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:34,456
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Producer Kang.</font>

597
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:38,356
<font color="yellow">This isn't easy.</font>

598
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,896
<font color="yellow">What? They want new locations for all scenes?</font>

599
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:45,726
<font color="yellow">That guy is honestly a handful.</font>

600
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:46,826
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

601
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:48,456
<font color="yellow">Producer Nam Ki Cheol who is directing the drama.</font>

602
00:32:48,456 --> 00:32:51,696
<font color="yellow">The shoot got delayed, so Producer Kang had to come.</font>

603
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:53,196
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

604
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:57,026
<font color="yellow">I went through hoops with him to pick the locations on this list.</font>

605
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,956
<font color="yellow">If they want to change it all up, the schedule will change, as well.</font>

606
00:33:00,226 --> 00:33:01,396
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll go through this.</font>

607
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,396
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

608
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:05,456
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

609
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:13,396
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

610
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:14,956
<font color="yellow">Open it.</font>

611
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:18,826
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking that?</font>

612
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:47,556
<font color="yellow">The festival is going on now,</font>

613
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:49,456
<font color="yellow">so please visit often and help us promote it.</font>

614
00:33:49,656 --> 00:33:50,656
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - Okay.</font>

615
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:55,496
<font color="yellow">Hi. We're wondering if we go inside, what is there to see?</font>

616
00:33:55,696 --> 00:33:56,696
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

617
00:33:57,226 --> 00:34:00,126
<font color="yellow">So this guy is a Korean philosopher...</font>

618
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:02,956
<font color="yellow">named Yi I, also known as Yulgok.</font>

619
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:07,926
<font color="yellow">So he is a Korean equivalent to Socrates and Confucius.</font>

620
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:12,596
<font color="yellow">In here, we're celebrating his life and achievement.</font>

621
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:15,626
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. We'll have a look. - Perfect. Thank you.</font>

622
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:17,796
<font color="yellow">Ji Sun.</font>

623
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:19,926
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jun.</font>

624
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,326
<font color="yellow">You're doing a good job, right?</font>

625
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,326
<font color="yellow">Of course. Did you bring the thing I asked you about?</font>

626
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:24,526
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

627
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:26,856
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

628
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:31,326
<font color="yellow">So these are healthy recipes you came up with.</font>

629
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:35,696
<font color="yellow">I wrote down every single recipe by hand, so make sure to use them.</font>

630
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:37,096
<font color="yellow">I will, of course.</font>

631
00:34:37,426 --> 00:34:38,896
<font color="yellow">This will help me be on a strict diet.</font>

632
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:40,896
<font color="yellow">I'm only giving it to you because you represent Woori City.</font>

633
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:44,896
<font color="yellow">I'm done here now. Do you want to grab a bite with me?</font>

634
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:49,156
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Okay!</font>

635
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:53,096
<font color="yellow">I'm here, Writer Ko!</font>

636
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,066
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

637
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:57,656
<font color="yellow">Here. Please have a seat.</font>

638
00:34:57,756 --> 00:34:59,026
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

639
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:03,096
<font color="yellow">Are the shoots going well?</font>

640
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:05,296
<font color="yellow">Actually, it's...</font>

641
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:08,226
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there a problem with the script?</font>

642
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:09,626
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

643
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:12,656
<font color="yellow">I think I'm having a difficult time because of my greed.</font>

644
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,696
<font color="yellow">I cancelled the shoot and just came to see you.</font>

645
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:17,566
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me?</font>

646
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:19,826
<font color="yellow">I was reading the script,</font>

647
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:22,656
<font color="yellow">and one of the lines you wrote really spoke to me.</font>

648
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,096
<font color="yellow">Which one?</font>

649
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:27,196
<font color="yellow">"In life, you ultimately have to trust yourself."</font>

650
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:31,426
<font color="yellow">"If you can't trust yourself, you'll end up getting lost."</font>

651
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:34,066
<font color="yellow">- Something like that. - Oh, that part.</font>

652
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:37,626
<font color="yellow">I suddenly started missing you.</font>

653
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:40,956
<font color="yellow">Well... Would you like to eat something?</font>

654
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:42,296
<font color="yellow">Oh, shall we?</font>

655
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,226
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae.</font>

656
00:35:48,156 --> 00:35:49,156
<font color="yellow">Jun Woo.</font>

657
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:55,726
<font color="yellow">Are you two out on a date?</font>

658
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:58,296
<font color="yellow">Yes, I guess you can say that.</font>

659
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:02,496
<font color="yellow">We're not on a date. We met up because of work.</font>

660
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:05,156
<font color="yellow">It's true that I came to see you because of work stress,</font>

661
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:07,226
<font color="yellow">but I'm not here because of work.</font>

662
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:11,596
<font color="yellow">You two look so lovely together.</font>

663
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:13,926
<font color="yellow">You two look more lovely together.</font>

664
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:17,696
<font color="yellow">You're both tall, and you have great chemistry together.</font>

665
00:36:19,566 --> 00:36:20,796
<font color="yellow">She's just a friend of mine.</font>

666
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:27,596
<font color="yellow">That was delicious.</font>

667
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:30,156
<font color="yellow">- What did you think of the food? - It was good.</font>

668
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,796
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now. You should go in.</font>

669
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:36,856
<font color="yellow">If I didn't have the event tomorrow, I'd love to have drinks with you.</font>

670
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:38,226
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

671
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:39,956
<font color="yellow">That's too bad.</font>

672
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:42,226
<font color="yellow">Jun.</font>

673
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,896
<font color="yellow">Thanks for this. It'll be put to good use.</font>

674
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:46,126
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

675
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:47,626
<font color="yellow">Mi Rae, see you around.</font>

676
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:49,156
<font color="yellow">Yes, see you.</font>

677
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:53,996
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

678
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:57,526
<font color="yellow">Have a good time. I'll get going now.</font>

679
00:36:57,656 --> 00:36:58,796
<font color="yellow">No, wait.</font>

680
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:01,956
<font color="yellow">Call me if you have any questions about the script.</font>

681
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:03,156
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

682
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:06,856
<font color="yellow">By the way, do the two of you really live in the same house?</font>

683
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:08,726
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Yes.</font>

684
00:37:10,566 --> 00:37:11,996
<font color="yellow">I'll trust you, all right?</font>

685
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:13,456
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

686
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:15,996
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Bye.</font>

687
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:19,396
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Okay.</font>

688
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:24,496
<font color="yellow">It looked like he had something to say to you. You should've stayed.</font>

689
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:27,296
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you spend more time with Ji Sun?</font>

690
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:31,956
<font color="yellow">What was that by the way?</font>

691
00:37:32,856 --> 00:37:34,356
<font color="yellow">It looked like a jotter.</font>

692
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:36,826
<font color="yellow">It's my recipe note.</font>

693
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:38,626
<font color="yellow">It has healthy recipes.</font>

694
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:41,566
<font color="yellow">Why did you give it to her? Because she now models for the city?</font>

695
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:43,956
<font color="yellow">I just felt bad.</font>

696
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:47,066
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're giving her hope.</font>

697
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,856
<font color="yellow">Why don't you date that guy? Producer Nam or whoever he is.</font>

698
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:55,566
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

699
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,956
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you feeling shy about it?</font>

700
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:02,726
<font color="yellow">Being attracted to someone isn't something to be ashamed of.</font>

701
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:06,656
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

702
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:12,396
<font color="yellow">what would you do if you confess your feelings to someone...</font>

703
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:15,826
<font color="yellow">and end up ruining your relationship with that person?</font>

704
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:18,526
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

705
00:38:22,796 --> 00:38:25,656
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to that comic book cafe we used to go to a lot?</font>

706
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:28,626
<font color="yellow">- Comic book cafe? - Yes.</font>

707
00:38:29,496 --> 00:38:31,066
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it feel so good to be back here?</font>

708
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:33,456
<font color="yellow">Yes. It feels strange in a very good way.</font>

709
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:36,496
<font color="yellow">Coming here always sends me on a trip down the memory lane.</font>

710
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:37,956
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

711
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:40,356
<font color="yellow">We read so many comic books here.</font>

712
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:43,156
<font color="yellow">Yes. On the days that I ended up crying while reading comic books,</font>

713
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,296
<font color="yellow">you came and read with me until sundown.</font>

714
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:47,726
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

715
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,656
<font color="yellow">By the way, why did you want to come here out of the blue?</font>

716
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,566
<font color="yellow">No specific reason. I just miss the old days.</font>

717
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:55,126
<font color="yellow">That means you're getting old.</font>

718
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:57,126
<font color="yellow">I'm an adult now too, you know.</font>

719
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:00,826
<font color="yellow">I need the first volume.</font>

720
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:11,896
<font color="yellow">The fourth volume. I need it.</font>

721
00:39:11,956 --> 00:39:13,496
<font color="yellow">Why are you so slow?</font>

722
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:15,696
<font color="yellow">Look at this. It's a dog. A puppy.</font>

723
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,226
<font color="yellow">Look at this one.</font>

724
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,066
<font color="yellow">This is you.</font>

725
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:52,126
<font color="yellow">You're handsome.</font>

726
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,066
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

727
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:10,696
<font color="yellow">Mosquito! I have to catch this mosquito!</font>

728
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:12,066
<font color="yellow">This mosquito.</font>

729
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:15,156
<font color="yellow">- I've got to catch this bugger. - Gosh, seriously.</font>

730
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:17,296
<font color="yellow">My gosh. And?</font>

731
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:19,626
<font color="yellow">I told her that she was being too heartless.</font>

732
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:22,596
<font color="yellow">I get that Mr Ko moved all of her stuff for her,</font>

733
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:25,426
<font color="yellow">but how can she take his family's side?</font>

734
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,566
<font color="yellow">Getting back together wasn't easy for them, so try to understand her.</font>

735
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,156
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>

736
00:40:34,296 --> 00:40:36,626
<font color="yellow">What's this silence? Were you guys talking about me?</font>

737
00:40:37,496 --> 00:40:38,496
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

738
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:41,566
<font color="yellow">"Love or friendship?" Something along the lines of that.</font>

739
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:46,126
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

740
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:48,956
<font color="yellow">I should've asked you how you got to know Cheon Soo.</font>

741
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:52,456
<font color="yellow">I should've listened to you and tried to understand you first.</font>

742
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:54,396
<font color="yellow">Are you realising that just now?</font>

743
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:57,456
<font color="yellow">This divorcee here has been acting as if she's a pro in this business,</font>

744
00:40:57,726 --> 00:40:59,126
<font color="yellow">but she was clueless.</font>

745
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,356
<font color="yellow">- What about you? - What?</font>

746
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:05,756
<font color="yellow">You got back together with him. Shouldn't there be some progress?</font>

747
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:07,596
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about now?</font>

748
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,626
<font color="yellow">You can start sharing the kitchen...</font>

749
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:11,066
<font color="yellow">or...</font>

750
00:41:11,456 --> 00:41:13,026
<font color="yellow">knock down the wall between the two houses.</font>

751
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:14,296
<font color="yellow">Or just get married.</font>

752
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:15,826
<font color="yellow">Stop it, guys.</font>

753
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:17,526
<font color="yellow">You've never thought about it?</font>

754
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:21,926
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm content with how things are now.</font>

755
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:26,156
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous. You're living the kind of life I've been dreaming of.</font>

756
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:31,296
<font color="yellow">How will you face his family if they end up getting married?</font>

757
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:32,856
<font color="yellow">Because of Richard?</font>

758
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:35,596
<font color="yellow">It's not like he lives in that house.</font>

759
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:37,156
<font color="yellow">His wife moved out because of you.</font>

760
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:40,126
<font color="yellow">She's staying at Sang Sik's place now.</font>

761
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:41,356
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

762
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:45,196
<font color="yellow">Then Richard must be alone at his place.</font>

763
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,026
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you going to call him?</font>

764
00:41:49,396 --> 00:41:50,626
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

765
00:41:54,756 --> 00:41:55,756
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

766
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:58,456
<font color="yellow">Welcome to Death Experience.</font>

767
00:41:58,956 --> 00:42:01,696
<font color="yellow">This experience will allow you to understand the value of life...</font>

768
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:02,896
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

769
00:42:03,226 --> 00:42:06,356
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, don't you think this is too much?</font>

770
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:08,126
<font color="yellow">Those who think their lives are filled with problems.</font>

771
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:11,096
<font color="yellow">The 10 minutes you spend in the coffin...</font>

772
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:15,496
<font color="yellow">will give you a chance to reflect on your life and wrongdoings.</font>

773
00:42:15,756 --> 00:42:17,396
<font color="yellow">What is this by the way?</font>

774
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:19,356
<font color="yellow">- It's your will. - Pardon me?</font>

775
00:42:20,566 --> 00:42:22,326
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik, please.</font>

776
00:42:22,526 --> 00:42:23,656
<font color="yellow">Just write it.</font>

777
00:42:26,356 --> 00:42:29,156
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's not like I'm going to die soon.</font>

778
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:31,726
<font color="yellow">Please lie down in the coffin now.</font>

779
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:36,326
<font color="yellow">This is crazy.</font>

780
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,496
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

781
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:41,026
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

782
00:42:52,956 --> 00:42:54,626
<font color="yellow">What are we doing now, seriously?</font>

783
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:58,156
<font color="yellow">Just go in and lie down.</font>

784
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,596
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is insane.</font>

785
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:06,396
<font color="yellow">This is just ridiculous.</font>

786
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:09,356
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to do this?</font>

787
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:12,066
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

788
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:15,896
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sang Sik.</font>

789
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:18,956
<font color="yellow">You don't need to apologise to me.</font>

790
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:20,226
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

791
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:23,096
<font color="yellow">I'll be devoted to Sang Hee,</font>

792
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:25,926
<font color="yellow">and I promise that I'll be good to her.</font>

793
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:27,756
<font color="yellow">You said you can't communicate with her, though.</font>

794
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:30,756
<font color="yellow">I should try harder.</font>

795
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:33,756
<font color="yellow">I'll try to initiate conversations...</font>

796
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:36,566
<font color="yellow">and repeat myself if she doesn't understand me.</font>

797
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:40,226
<font color="yellow">If she goes off topic, I'll explain it to her.</font>

798
00:43:40,656 --> 00:43:42,356
<font color="yellow">We will close the lid now.</font>

799
00:43:43,756 --> 00:43:45,096
<font color="yellow">Sorry? The lid?</font>

800
00:43:45,296 --> 00:43:48,056
<font color="yellow">Why in the world are you closing the lid?</font>

801
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,226
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

802
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,396
<font color="yellow">You're way too chatty for someone who is about to die.</font>

803
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,426
<font color="yellow">Let's die peacefully.</font>

804
00:43:54,326 --> 00:43:55,326
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik!</font>

805
00:43:55,456 --> 00:43:58,356
<font color="yellow">- Please stay still. - Wait. Wait, please. Sang Sik.</font>

806
00:43:58,456 --> 00:44:00,126
<font color="yellow">No, this is wrong. Sang Sik!</font>

807
00:44:00,226 --> 00:44:02,796
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik!</font>

808
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:07,926
<font color="yellow">I'm so done with making sacrifices.</font>

809
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:11,056
<font color="yellow">I've been trying so hard to save and never spent a penny on me.</font>

810
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:14,526
<font color="yellow">And what? You can't stand how stingy I am?</font>

811
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:25,856
<font color="yellow">I'd like to get all of these.</font>

812
00:44:26,156 --> 00:44:27,156
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

813
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:36,426
<font color="yellow">How did your afterlife treat you?</font>

814
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:42,696
<font color="yellow">My life feels so futile.</font>

815
00:44:43,926 --> 00:44:46,526
<font color="yellow">All sorts of thoughts crossed my mind.</font>

816
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:49,996
<font color="yellow">I really should not live like this any more.</font>

817
00:44:52,126 --> 00:44:53,196
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

818
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:55,826
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it feel like you've wasted your entire life?</font>

819
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:57,896
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik...</font>

820
00:45:01,896 --> 00:45:03,226
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get up.</font>

821
00:45:04,596 --> 00:45:07,356
<font color="yellow">No. I'm just going to stay here.</font>

822
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:08,856
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

823
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:10,996
<font color="yellow">I'll stay in this coffin.</font>

824
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:12,856
<font color="yellow">You can just go ahead and bury me.</font>

825
00:45:13,126 --> 00:45:14,296
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're such a handful.</font>

826
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:17,296
<font color="yellow">Hey, get up. Come on.</font>

827
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:19,996
<font color="yellow">Just leave me alone.</font>

828
00:45:20,196 --> 00:45:23,326
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's enough. Just get up already. Come on.</font>

829
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:27,396
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

830
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:29,626
<font color="yellow">What did you write in your will?</font>

831
00:45:30,496 --> 00:45:31,696
<font color="yellow">I wrote that...</font>

832
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:36,226
<font color="yellow">although I'm not a husband with great competence,</font>

833
00:45:37,226 --> 00:45:38,896
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful that...</font>

834
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:41,426
<font color="yellow">she trusted and stayed with me until now.</font>

835
00:45:43,096 --> 00:45:44,296
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

836
00:45:44,726 --> 00:45:45,726
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

837
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:49,896
<font color="yellow">I wrote that I hope my family will stay healthy like now.</font>

838
00:45:50,296 --> 00:45:51,826
<font color="yellow">How's that your will?</font>

839
00:45:52,796 --> 00:45:54,126
<font color="yellow">It's just your hope.</font>

840
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:56,096
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

841
00:45:57,726 --> 00:45:58,726
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

842
00:46:02,356 --> 00:46:05,496
<font color="yellow">By the way, when's the Top 10 Chef party?</font>

843
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:07,756
<font color="yellow">It's this weekend. Why?</font>

844
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:09,826
<font color="yellow">I was just curious.</font>

845
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:14,826
<font color="yellow">There must be many beautiful female chefs there, too.</font>

846
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:17,296
<font color="yellow">There are a few.</font>

847
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:18,856
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

848
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:21,196
<font color="yellow">Why don't you come with me?</font>

849
00:46:21,726 --> 00:46:23,296
<font color="yellow">No, why would I go there?</font>

850
00:46:24,226 --> 00:46:26,626
<font color="yellow">Don't worry because it's not a party for couples.</font>

851
00:46:27,296 --> 00:46:29,596
<font color="yellow">It's just a party where friends are invited.</font>

852
00:46:30,226 --> 00:46:31,356
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

853
00:46:32,296 --> 00:46:33,526
<font color="yellow">Then shall I come, too?</font>

854
00:46:33,726 --> 00:46:34,826
<font color="yellow">If you want.</font>

855
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:38,826
<font color="yellow">Ji Sun isn't coming, is she?</font>

856
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,896
<font color="yellow">Why would she come?</font>

857
00:46:41,856 --> 00:46:43,656
<font color="yellow">She's your friend.</font>

858
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:46,656
<font color="yellow">You're the closest friend to me.</font>

859
00:46:48,126 --> 00:46:49,226
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

860
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:51,056
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

861
00:46:51,296 --> 00:46:52,296
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

862
00:46:54,556 --> 00:46:56,356
<font color="yellow">Gosh, these are heavy.</font>

863
00:46:57,026 --> 00:46:58,296
<font color="yellow">- These are heavy. - My goodness.</font>

864
00:46:58,496 --> 00:46:59,496
<font color="yellow">Give them to me.</font>

865
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:12,526
<font color="yellow">Do you want to return all of these?</font>

866
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:15,456
<font color="yellow">If it's too much,</font>

867
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:17,596
<font color="yellow">I'll exchange them.</font>

868
00:47:17,896 --> 00:47:19,396
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

869
00:47:34,626 --> 00:47:35,656
<font color="yellow">Sang Hee.</font>

870
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:39,826
<font color="yellow">Why are you so startled?</font>

871
00:47:40,726 --> 00:47:41,856
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

872
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,356
<font color="yellow">Whose clothes are those?</font>

873
00:47:43,356 --> 00:47:47,156
<font color="yellow">Oh, I came to buy some clothes for Hoon.</font>

874
00:47:47,556 --> 00:47:49,726
<font color="yellow">I noticed all these clothes are on sale.</font>

875
00:47:50,296 --> 00:47:52,156
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

876
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:53,956
<font color="yellow">I'm here to get groceries.</font>

877
00:47:54,226 --> 00:47:55,226
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

878
00:47:56,596 --> 00:47:58,226
<font color="yellow">Do you want exchange this scarf, too?</font>

879
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:02,156
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm sorry.</font>

880
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:03,296
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

881
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:09,396
<font color="yellow">You didn't make up yet, but did you...</font>

882
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:11,226
<font color="yellow">exchange everything to your husband's clothes?</font>

883
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:12,896
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

884
00:48:13,326 --> 00:48:16,356
<font color="yellow">I also got Hoon's clothes.</font>

885
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:19,626
<font color="yellow">It's the same for everyone who's married.</font>

886
00:48:19,926 --> 00:48:22,156
<font color="yellow">It's a waste to spend money on my own clothes.</font>

887
00:48:22,826 --> 00:48:25,226
<font color="yellow">It's not like I earn money.</font>

888
00:48:25,556 --> 00:48:28,456
<font color="yellow">Many housewives are great at taking care of their family,</font>

889
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,326
<font color="yellow">but I'm not like that, either.</font>

890
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:33,496
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense. You've been a good wife so far.</font>

891
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:35,596
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything.</font>

892
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:39,196
<font color="yellow">I know by tasting Sang Sik's aged kimchi and bean paste.</font>

893
00:48:39,656 --> 00:48:42,426
<font color="yellow">How did you know? I made all of them.</font>

894
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:43,756
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean.</font>

895
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:45,796
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

896
00:48:46,696 --> 00:48:49,626
<font color="yellow">my friend told me honestly.</font>

897
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,496
<font color="yellow">There was nothing between her and your husband.</font>

898
00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:58,156
<font color="yellow">She thinks that it was a temporary...</font>

899
00:48:58,526 --> 00:49:00,826
<font color="yellow">escape for your husband.</font>

900
00:49:01,296 --> 00:49:02,296
<font color="yellow">Escape?</font>

901
00:49:03,226 --> 00:49:06,226
<font color="yellow">I wish I could also escape for a little while.</font>

902
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:09,896
<font color="yellow">Since she's never had a family before,</font>

903
00:49:10,096 --> 00:49:12,656
<font color="yellow">she must think adultery isn't a big deal.</font>

904
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:15,626
<font color="yellow">My friend was once married...</font>

905
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:17,396
<font color="yellow">and went through a divorce.</font>

906
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:21,696
<font color="yellow">Then she knows enough about life.</font>

907
00:49:22,056 --> 00:49:23,756
<font color="yellow">She really had no idea.</font>

908
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:25,156
<font color="yellow">Please believe her.</font>

909
00:49:25,156 --> 00:49:28,226
<font color="yellow">That's why I hate my husband even more.</font>

910
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:32,496
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

911
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:41,026
<font color="yellow">What? I didn't buy this.</font>

912
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:42,226
<font color="yellow">Where's the receipt?</font>

913
00:49:44,196 --> 00:49:45,596
<font color="yellow">It's not on the receipt.</font>

914
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:50,056
<font color="yellow">When you shop clothes for your family,</font>

915
00:49:50,456 --> 00:49:52,156
<font color="yellow">you can also get...</font>

916
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,456
<font color="yellow">a scarf for yourself as a way to love yourself.</font>

917
00:49:56,596 --> 00:49:58,096
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

918
00:50:04,996 --> 00:50:05,996
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

919
00:50:06,096 --> 00:50:07,396
<font color="yellow">What? Nothing.</font>

920
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:09,156
<font color="yellow">What are all these?</font>

921
00:50:11,296 --> 00:50:12,296
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

922
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:14,056
<font color="yellow">These are all for Cheon Soo.</font>

923
00:50:14,456 --> 00:50:16,056
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

924
00:50:16,156 --> 00:50:17,756
<font color="yellow">Why did you move out then?</font>

925
00:50:18,126 --> 00:50:19,126
<font color="yellow">Move back in.</font>

926
00:50:19,496 --> 00:50:20,496
<font color="yellow">Sang Sik.</font>

927
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,896
<font color="yellow">- This. - What is it?</font>

928
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:27,696
<font color="yellow">I picked it out at the shop, but I didn't buy it to save money.</font>

929
00:50:27,896 --> 00:50:29,896
<font color="yellow">Then our neighbour bought it secretly...</font>

930
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:32,756
<font color="yellow">and put it in my bag, for which I'm grateful.</font>

931
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:34,156
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

932
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,756
<font color="yellow">It's nothing big, but I feel so good.</font>

933
00:50:37,196 --> 00:50:38,626
<font color="yellow">It'd be great if my husband was like her.</font>

934
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:40,556
<font color="yellow">Why did you buy him all these then?</font>

935
00:50:40,756 --> 00:50:41,856
<font color="yellow">He doesn't deserve it.</font>

936
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:43,756
<font color="yellow">How can I help myself?</font>

937
00:50:44,496 --> 00:50:45,626
<font color="yellow">Give them to me. I'll throw them away.</font>

938
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,756
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

939
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:48,426
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much they cost?</font>

940
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:50,696
<font color="yellow">If you forgive him, move back in and talk it over.</font>

941
00:50:51,096 --> 00:50:52,426
<font color="yellow">Don't buy things like these ever again.</font>

942
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:54,896
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

943
00:51:07,556 --> 00:51:09,856
<font color="yellow">- It's delicious. - Isn't it?</font>

944
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:15,656
<font color="yellow">It's great to be out like this.</font>

945
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:18,956
<font color="yellow">There's nothing particularly special about youth.</font>

946
00:51:20,096 --> 00:51:21,396
<font color="yellow">Until your 40s,</font>

947
00:51:21,926 --> 00:51:23,996
<font color="yellow">you only get a taste of life.</font>

948
00:51:24,326 --> 00:51:28,756
<font color="yellow">Once you're over 50, you enjoy the real taste of life.</font>

949
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:30,656
<font color="yellow">But weren't these couple shirts too much?</font>

950
00:51:30,856 --> 00:51:31,856
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

951
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:34,756
<font color="yellow">We're on our way to get our couple rings.</font>

952
00:51:35,056 --> 00:51:36,596
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

953
00:51:37,756 --> 00:51:40,226
<font color="yellow">You said you're having a hard time at City Hall...</font>

954
00:51:40,526 --> 00:51:41,796
<font color="yellow">with many audits these days.</font>

955
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:43,296
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

956
00:51:44,096 --> 00:51:46,996
<font color="yellow">People like Chief Ko shouldn't be put in a disadvantageous situation.</font>

957
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,556
<font color="yellow">But even in my position,</font>

958
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:52,196
<font color="yellow">I still face my difficulties.</font>

959
00:51:53,396 --> 00:51:56,356
<font color="yellow">Quit your job right away.</font>

960
00:51:56,856 --> 00:52:00,556
<font color="yellow">Then you should go travel with me.</font>

961
00:52:00,756 --> 00:52:02,496
<font color="yellow">Don't tempt me.</font>

962
00:52:02,696 --> 00:52:05,096
<font color="yellow">I still have dreams and aspirations.</font>

963
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:06,796
<font color="yellow">Is it work or me?</font>

964
00:52:07,326 --> 00:52:09,126
<font color="yellow">Choose just one.</font>

965
00:52:10,456 --> 00:52:12,456
<font color="yellow">It's me, myself.</font>

966
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:13,856
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

967
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:16,496
<font color="yellow">Goodness, aren't you Ms Na?</font>

968
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:18,396
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Hello.</font>

969
00:52:18,496 --> 00:52:20,896
<font color="yellow">Hello, it's nice to meet you.</font>

970
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,096
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

971
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:25,756
<font color="yellow">What on earth?</font>

972
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:29,356
<font color="yellow">How could you thrust my hand away?</font>

973
00:52:29,556 --> 00:52:32,996
<font color="yellow">- I have a reputation to keep. - Forget about our couple rings.</font>

974
00:52:33,296 --> 00:52:35,556
<font color="yellow">Come on, Ko Bong.</font>

975
00:52:44,226 --> 00:52:45,226
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

976
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:47,896
<font color="yellow">Choose anything you like.</font>

977
00:52:48,096 --> 00:52:49,096
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

978
00:52:58,696 --> 00:53:01,326
<font color="yellow">Don't you have to reschedule all the film shooting?</font>

979
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:02,656
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

980
00:53:03,756 --> 00:53:05,396
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's ramyeon.</font>

981
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:07,456
<font color="yellow">I was about to make some.</font>

982
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:10,296
<font color="yellow">It's special seafood ramyeon. Turn off the gas. It'll get soggy.</font>

983
00:53:14,026 --> 00:53:16,896
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted ramyeon since you ate oily food during the day.</font>

984
00:53:17,296 --> 00:53:18,296
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat.</font>

985
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,026
<font color="yellow">What if your family sees us?</font>

986
00:53:22,226 --> 00:53:24,556
<font color="yellow">Who cares? Go ahead.</font>

987
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:27,096
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

988
00:53:27,896 --> 00:53:30,156
<font color="yellow">Ms Kang, it's Ye Ji.</font>

989
00:53:30,696 --> 00:53:31,696
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

990
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:40,756
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

991
00:53:43,526 --> 00:53:45,126
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

992
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:46,726
<font color="yellow">Okay, have a seat.</font>

993
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:48,456
<font color="yellow">Were you eating?</font>

994
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:49,756
<font color="yellow">Do you want some?</font>

995
00:53:49,856 --> 00:53:52,096
<font color="yellow">No, I'm on a diet.</font>

996
00:53:53,026 --> 00:53:55,856
<font color="yellow">I made some to eat, but I don't want it any more.</font>

997
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:01,296
<font color="yellow">What do you want to talk about?</font>

998
00:54:01,726 --> 00:54:04,326
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about asking Dad,</font>

999
00:54:05,596 --> 00:54:07,356
<font color="yellow">but I came here since I feel more at ease with you.</font>

1000
00:54:08,356 --> 00:54:09,456
<font color="yellow">It's this.</font>

1001
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:13,226
<font color="yellow">Oh, this.</font>

1002
00:54:14,656 --> 00:54:17,696
<font color="yellow">I don't believe what the article says. I trust Dad.</font>

1003
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:20,196
<font color="yellow">Of course you should.</font>

1004
00:54:20,596 --> 00:54:24,356
<font color="yellow">I'm more curious about your relationship with Dad.</font>

1005
00:54:27,896 --> 00:54:28,926
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

1006
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:33,126
<font color="yellow">I'm happy that you moved back,</font>

1007
00:54:33,826 --> 00:54:36,056
<font color="yellow">but I don't want to put a burden on you.</font>

1008
00:54:37,196 --> 00:54:38,896
<font color="yellow">- A burden? - I don't mind...</font>

1009
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,926
<font color="yellow">living with my aunts.</font>

1010
00:54:41,226 --> 00:54:43,526
<font color="yellow">In case you and Dad want to live together,</font>

1011
00:54:43,626 --> 00:54:46,296
<font color="yellow">but are hesitating because of me,</font>

1012
00:54:46,856 --> 00:54:48,796
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you beforehand that it's okay.</font>

1013
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:53,456
<font color="yellow">Why did you think that suddenly?</font>

1014
00:54:54,296 --> 00:54:57,956
<font color="yellow">You moved everything out and then came back.</font>

1015
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,056
<font color="yellow">That means you and Dad became closer.</font>

1016
00:55:02,756 --> 00:55:04,796
<font color="yellow">It's true, but you don't have to worry about that.</font>

1017
00:55:04,996 --> 00:55:06,996
<font color="yellow">We can just be neighbours.</font>

1018
00:55:07,196 --> 00:55:08,196
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

1019
00:55:08,726 --> 00:55:09,856
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

1020
00:55:10,196 --> 00:55:12,096
<font color="yellow">That must mean you haven't gone very far.</font>

1021
00:55:12,696 --> 00:55:14,096
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't believe Dad.</font>

1022
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:15,456
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1023
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:19,196
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you understand what I mean, right?</font>

1024
00:55:20,296 --> 00:55:23,296
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you for your thoughts.</font>

1025
00:55:24,096 --> 00:55:25,096
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

1026
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:27,126
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

1027
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:28,356
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1028
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:30,796
<font color="yellow">- Sleep well. - Thank you.</font>

1029
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:47,126
<font color="yellow">I don't feel so good.</font>

1030
00:55:48,026 --> 00:55:50,456
<font color="yellow">Ye Ji is very sweet.</font>

1031
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:54,826
<font color="yellow">What should we do about the ramyeon? It's probably soggy.</font>

1032
00:55:54,926 --> 00:55:56,596
<font color="yellow">I'll make some more.</font>

1033
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,496
<font color="yellow">I'll look forward to it.</font>

1034
00:56:09,226 --> 00:56:10,496
<font color="yellow">You haven't gone on a date?</font>

1035
00:56:11,396 --> 00:56:12,856
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1036
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:14,896
<font color="yellow">Plus, I also missed you.</font>

1037
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,126
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1038
00:56:17,826 --> 00:56:19,796
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go eat something else?</font>

1039
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:22,456
<font color="yellow">- Why? - You know the dentist...</font>

1040
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:25,026
<font color="yellow">I mentioned whom I had a blind date with?</font>

1041
00:56:25,226 --> 00:56:27,526
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Every time we met,</font>

1042
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:29,756
<font color="yellow">we had food like steaks and pasta,</font>

1043
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:31,926
<font color="yellow">so I feel like I have an upset stomach.</font>

1044
00:56:33,496 --> 00:56:34,826
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat then?</font>

1045
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:37,496
<font color="yellow">I want some spicy kimchi stew made...</font>

1046
00:56:37,596 --> 00:56:39,296
<font color="yellow">with a lot of pork.</font>

1047
00:56:41,926 --> 00:56:44,356
<font color="yellow">Why do you eat expensive steaks with her...</font>

1048
00:56:44,596 --> 00:56:46,296
<font color="yellow">while you eat cheap food like stew with me?</font>

1049
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,396
<font color="yellow">It somehow turned out that way.</font>

1050
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:52,226
<font color="yellow">You don't like the idea?</font>

1051
00:56:52,796 --> 00:56:53,796
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

1052
00:56:54,596 --> 00:56:56,226
<font color="yellow">I know a place that makes good kimchi stew.</font>

1053
00:56:57,756 --> 00:56:59,226
<font color="yellow">You're so sensible.</font>

1054
00:56:59,656 --> 00:57:01,356
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you today.</font>

1055
00:57:01,996 --> 00:57:03,226
<font color="yellow">You're so sensible.</font>

1056
00:57:12,156 --> 00:57:13,526
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

1057
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:15,696
<font color="yellow">You can leave it.</font>

1058
00:57:16,126 --> 00:57:17,796
<font color="yellow">We'll finish it faster if we do it together.</font>

1059
00:57:19,826 --> 00:57:21,026
<font color="yellow">How was the ramyeon?</font>

1060
00:57:21,926 --> 00:57:23,326
<font color="yellow">It was delicious but...</font>

1061
00:57:25,926 --> 00:57:27,026
<font color="yellow">Was it too salty?</font>

1062
00:57:27,796 --> 00:57:30,396
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's good as my seafood ramyeon.</font>

1063
00:57:33,056 --> 00:57:34,196
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

1064
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:37,296
<font color="yellow">I'm not done with it. Give it back.</font>

1065
00:57:37,926 --> 00:57:40,456
<font color="yellow">- Let's do it together. - I'll do it.</font>

1066
00:57:40,926 --> 00:57:41,926
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1067
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:45,296
<font color="yellow">It was delicious.</font>

1068
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:46,596
<font color="yellow">You make it yourself next time.</font>

1069
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:49,996
<font color="yellow">It would've been better if some squid was added.</font>

1070
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:53,926
<font color="yellow">Now that I became an adult, I realised comfort in ordinary...</font>

1071
00:57:54,026 --> 00:57:57,526
<font color="yellow">lives is much happier than a moment of excitement.</font>

1072
00:58:00,126 --> 00:58:02,126
<font color="yellow">Shall we do some work?</font>

1073
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:05,696
<font color="yellow">We were supposed to shoot here,</font>

1074
00:58:06,156 --> 00:58:07,956
<font color="yellow">but how about shooting it here?</font>

1075
00:58:09,196 --> 00:58:11,356
<font color="yellow">- That sounds good. - Will it be possible?</font>

1076
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,926
