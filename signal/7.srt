00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,280
<font color="yellow">If I knew you'd be back here,</font>

160
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,680
<font color="yellow">then I wouldn't have cleared your charge.</font>

161
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,210
<font color="yellow">That man...</font>

162
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,780
<font color="yellow">He paid for what he did...</font>

163
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,850
<font color="yellow">and I'll pay for my crimes.</font>

164
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,580
<font color="yellow">It's only you who's still in here.</font>

165
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,280
<font color="yellow">Everybody involved is living their life again,</font>

166
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,950
<font color="yellow">but why are you still in here?</font>

167
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,180
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep doing this?</font>

168
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,580
<font color="yellow">The real bad guys will forget about everything...</font>

169
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,080
<font color="yellow">and move on with their lives.</font>

170
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,680
<font color="yellow">Why... Why are you still here?</font>

171
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,210
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

172
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,010
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

173
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,310
<font color="yellow">I heard Oh Kyung Tae died here while serving his time.</font>

174
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,410
<font color="yellow">There it is.</font>

175
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,210
<font color="yellow">(OH KYUNG TAE, 1958-2005)</font>

176
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,550
<font color="yellow">(PARK SUN WOO)</font>

177
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,480
<font color="yellow">There's not even a tombstone.</font>

178
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,080
<font color="yellow">Is this it?</font>

179
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,580
<font color="yellow">We can't do much for convicts...</font>

180
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,680
<font color="yellow">without family or relatives.</font>

181
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,980
<font color="yellow">Even if you change the past,</font>

182
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,650
<font color="yellow">some things remain the same.</font>

183
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
<font color="yellow">The world...</font>

184
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,110
<font color="yellow">will always be unfair.</font>

185
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,980
<font color="yellow">There he comes.</font>

186
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,210
<font color="yellow">Hey, where's Chief?</font>

187
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,910
<font color="yellow">How come I can't reach him all day?</font>

188
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,410
<font color="yellow">- Hey, get over here.
- Look.</font>

189
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,850
<font color="yellow">It says Han Se Kyu broke in out of curiosity.</font>

190
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,950
<font color="yellow">What kind of crazy person breaks in to three houses out of curiosity?</font>

191
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,110
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Not only that,</font>

192
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,180
<font color="yellow">some items are still missing.</font>

193
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,080
<font color="yellow">They're not investigating properly.</font>

194
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,280
<font color="yellow">- Where's Chief?
- This is not the right time.</font>

195
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
<font color="yellow">Chief.</font>

196
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,780
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

197
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,410
<font color="yellow">How does this make any sense?</font>

198
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,010
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

199
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,580
<font color="yellow">We do as we are told.</font>

200
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,480
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? It's not like you did anything wrong.</font>

201
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,950
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

202
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,650
<font color="yellow">You've seen a detective being transferred before.</font>

203
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,380
<font color="yellow">It's Han Se Kyu, right?</font>

204
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,110
<font color="yellow">There's something more to it.</font>

205
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,680
<font color="yellow">That lowlife wouldn't do this out of curiosity.</font>

206
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,180
<font color="yellow">What's the real story?</font>

207
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,280
<font color="yellow">Do you know where Jinyang is?</font>

208
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,580
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's the new city that's being built, right?</font>

209
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,850
<font color="yellow">The team that was in charge of Hanyoung Bridge incident...</font>

210
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,110
<font color="yellow">did some background investigation on Sekang Construction Company.</font>

211
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,380
<font color="yellow">They found clues leading to...</font>

212
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,280
<font color="yellow">corruption charges involving the congressmen and the corporation.</font>

213
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,780
<font color="yellow">There's over several billion dollars involved.</font>

214
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

215
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,580
<font color="yellow">the three houses that were broken in have something to do with it.</font>

216
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,580
<font color="yellow">What's more important is...</font>

217
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,950
<font color="yellow">that I don't know if Han Se Kyu was aware of that,</font>

218
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,410
<font color="yellow">but the stolen items contained...</font>

219
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,850
<font color="yellow">a conclusive evidence for what went on.</font>

220
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,210
<font color="yellow">Even after knowing that,</font>

221
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,180
<font color="yellow">the prosecutor terminated the trial?</font>

222
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,910
<font color="yellow">Keep still and pretend you don't know anything.</font>

223
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,780
<font color="yellow">This case...</font>

224
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,180
<font color="yellow">is far bigger than the Police Squad can handle.</font>

225
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,380
<font color="yellow">- But still, we...
- You're still here.</font>

226
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,250
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

227
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,080
<font color="yellow">You're early.</font>

228
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,180
<font color="yellow">Say hello.</font>

229
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,980
<font color="yellow">This is Kim Beom Joo and he will be taking over.</font>

230
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,450
<font color="yellow">Say hello, everyone.</font>

231
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,780
<font color="yellow">This is Kim Beom Joo.</font>

232
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,780
<font color="yellow">Look after them for me.</font>

233
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,910
<font color="yellow">You're getting kicked out for not keeping them under control,</font>

234
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,550
<font color="yellow">and you want me to look after them?</font>

235
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,350
<font color="yellow">No wonder you ended up like this. You're too soft.</font>

236
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,250
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, though.</font>

237
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,910
<font color="yellow">I'll keep them under control.</font>

238
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,780
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

239
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,280
<font color="yellow">Wait...</font>

240
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,450
<font color="yellow">Are you Lee Jae Han?</font>

241
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,150
<font color="yellow">Do you know who I hate the most?</font>

242
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,380
<font color="yellow">An idiot who runs around thinking he has something others don't.</font>

243
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,580
<font color="yellow">Just one of them...</font>

244
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
<font color="yellow">makes everyone look bad.</font>

245
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,710
<font color="yellow">I would love to lie low,</font>

246
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,280
<font color="yellow">but you people just won't let me.</font>

247
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,710
<font color="yellow">It stinks.</font>

248
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,780
<font color="yellow">We deserve an award for jailing Han Se Kyu.</font>

249
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,980
<font color="yellow">Instead, our boss gets fired...</font>

250
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,280
<font color="yellow">and the higher-ups replaces him with one of their hounds.</font>

251
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,280
<font color="yellow">I'm guessing they're trying to hide something.</font>

252
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,480
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

253
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,980
<font color="yellow">I won't let you down.</font>

254
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,380
<font color="yellow">I'll stir things up.</font>

255
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,990
<font color="yellow">A bracelet of natural pearls and platinum.</font>

256
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,030
<font color="yellow">A pair of diamond earrings.</font>

257
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,530
<font color="yellow">They're here.</font>

258
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,590
<font color="yellow">Is this it?</font>

259
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,390
<font color="yellow">A blue diamond necklace.</font>

260
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,890
<font color="yellow">Blue diamond necklace?</font>

261
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,360
<font color="yellow">- Is it not here?
- I can't find it.</font>

262
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,290
<font color="yellow">- Is it gone?
- It's not in here.</font>

263
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,290
<font color="yellow">It's gone.</font>

264
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,390
<font color="yellow">Of all the things that Han Se Kyu stole,</font>

265
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,890
<font color="yellow">something could be used to prove...</font>

266
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,290
<font color="yellow">someone else's corruption.</font>

267
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,530
<font color="yellow">The missing item.</font>

268
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,260
<font color="yellow">A blue necklace that was taken from...</font>

269
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,090
<font color="yellow">Congressman Jang's home.</font>

270
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,890
<font color="yellow">You haven't been home in a month.</font>

271
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,190
<font color="yellow">Remember this.</font>

272
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,620
<font color="yellow">Congressman Jang and the other gentlemen...</font>

273
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,390
<font color="yellow">settled under the condition that you return everything you stole.</font>

274
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,560
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you know,</font>

275
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,520
<font color="yellow">but make sure you don't...</font>

276
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,520
<font color="yellow">tell anyone about these conditions.</font>

277
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,990
<font color="yellow">There he is.</font>

278
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,390
<font color="yellow">I'm Shin Dong Hoon.</font>

279
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,620
<font color="yellow">Han was released...</font>

280
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,760
<font color="yellow">under probation this morning.</font>

281
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,690
<font color="yellow">Some say it was a slap on the wrist. What do you think?</font>

282
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,990
<font color="yellow">He stole from you. What do you have to say?</font>

283
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,460
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm pretty sure...</font>

284
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,790
<font color="yellow">the judge made the right decision.</font>

285
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,620
<font color="yellow">Make way.</font>

286
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,160
<font color="yellow">You suffered a big loss. Can you forgive him?</font>

287
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,860
<font color="yellow">Did you retrieve your missing items?</font>

288
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,560
<font color="yellow">I'm Detective Lee Jae Han...</font>

289
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,190
<font color="yellow">from the Police Squad.</font>

290
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,890
<font color="yellow">You settled out of court...</font>

291
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,020
<font color="yellow">before you got everything back.</font>

292
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,990
<font color="yellow">You are so generous.</font>

293
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,560
<font color="yellow">- Move.
- Step aside.</font>

294
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,790
<font color="yellow">- Get out of the way!
- I'm not done!</font>

295
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,420
<font color="yellow">- Make way!
- Move it.</font>

296
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,490
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

297
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,190
<font color="yellow">Let go. Congressman!</font>

298
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
<font color="yellow">- Congressman!
- Congressman.</font>

299
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,090
<font color="yellow">- What's the rush?
- Please say something.</font>

300
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,490
<font color="yellow">Why did you show leniency to Han Se Kyu?</font>

301
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,020
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it have been nice if you'd shown...</font>

302
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,590
<font color="yellow">such generosity to Oh Kyung Tae as well?</font>

303
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,190
<font color="yellow">Or did you have...</font>

304
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,190
<font color="yellow">no choice but to release Han...</font>

305
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,720
<font color="yellow">because of the blue diamond necklace?</font>

308
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,320

312
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,490

<font color="yellow">it's not just you who's looking for Lee Jae Han.</font>

472
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,120
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me?
- Park Hae Young is...</font>

473
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,930
<font color="yellow">also looking up on him.</font>

474
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,190
<font color="yellow">Park Hae Young?</font>

475
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,520
<font color="yellow">He asked me...</font>

476
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,520
<font color="yellow">if I knew Detective Lee Jae Han from Homicide Division at Jinyang.</font>

477
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,760
<font color="yellow">How would he know Jae Han?</font>

478
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,120
<font color="yellow">None of his relatives have anything to do with Jae Han.</font>

479
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,120
<font color="yellow">Hae Young was a teenager when Jae Han went missing,</font>

480
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,560
<font color="yellow">so they can't have met.</font>

481
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,760
<font color="yellow">Hae Young...</font>

482
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,060
<font color="yellow">even asked someone from HR...</font>

483
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,760
<font color="yellow">to get him a copy of Jae Han's personnel file in secret.</font>

484
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,660
<font color="yellow">If they knew each other,</font>

485
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,560
<font color="yellow">he wouldn't have done so.</font>

486
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,860
<font color="yellow">They are strangers...</font>

487
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,760
<font color="yellow">with no ties whatsoever,</font>

488
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,590
<font color="yellow">but he's looking into Jae Han's past.</font>

489
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,120
<font color="yellow">Isn't that strange?</font>

490
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,760
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you keep tabs on your team?</font>

491
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,620
<font color="yellow">You're here early.</font>

492
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,660
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

493
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,960
<font color="yellow">You stink. Did you shower in alcohol this morning?</font>

494
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,260
<font color="yellow">Merci beaucoup.</font>

495
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
<font color="yellow">- It's fine.
- Gye Cheol.</font>

496
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,660
<font color="yellow">A new pasta place just opened up.</font>

497
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,360
<font color="yellow">How about cream pasta for lunch?</font>

498
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,860
<font color="yellow">I can't take cream on a hangover.</font>

499
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
<font color="yellow">You look too bulky for pasta anyway.</font>

500
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,020
<font color="yellow">I need soup to sooth my stomach.</font>

501
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,620
<font color="yellow">How about offal soup?</font>

502
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,860
<font color="yellow">You have gross taste for someone your age.</font>

503
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,320
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

504
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,660
<font color="yellow">Offal soup's the best for hangovers.</font>

505
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,060
<font color="yellow">You are so not on my level in many ways.</font>

506
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,660
<font color="yellow">What about Hae Young?</font>

507
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,890
<font color="yellow">Don't even ask him.</font>

508
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,690
<font color="yellow">He always eats alone. To look classy.</font>

509
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
<font color="yellow">Omurice.</font>

510
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
<font color="yellow">Omelette?</font>

511
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,020
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

512
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,520
<font color="yellow">Why? Don't you like omurice?</font>

513
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,690
<font color="yellow">With ketchup?</font>

514
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,120
<font color="yellow">Hello, Soo Hyun.</font>

515
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,490
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you. I researched...</font>

516
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,430
<font color="yellow">How about looking into this case next?</font>

517
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,690
<font color="yellow">Park Hae Young.</font>

518
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,160
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

519
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,690
<font color="yellow">Is this the long-term Cold Case Team?</font>

520
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,560
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

521
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,590
<font color="yellow">Detective Cha.</font>

522
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,160
<font color="yellow">Do I know you?</font>

523
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,160
<font color="yellow">We met once, long ago.</font>

524
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,060
<font color="yellow">You don't remember me.</font>

525
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,260
<font color="yellow">You came by with a male detective 20 years ago.</font>

526
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,490
<font color="yellow">His name was Lee Jae Han.</font>

527
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,160
<font color="yellow">Detective Lee Jae Han?</font>

528
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

529
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
<font color="yellow">Do you know him?</font>

530
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,460
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

531
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,460
<font color="yellow">I know another detective with that name.</font>

532
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,260
<font color="yellow">I'll let you two talk.</font>

533
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,760
<font color="yellow">I saw you on TV recently.</font>

534
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,020
<font color="yellow">You solved the South Gyeonggi serial killings.</font>

535
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,660
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

536
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,760
<font color="yellow">You're the only one...</font>

537
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,390
<font color="yellow">I could think of who can help.</font>

538
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,020
<font color="yellow">20 years ago,</font>

539
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,860
<font color="yellow">my fiancee died.</font>

540
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,460
<font color="yellow">Her name was Shin Da Hye.</font>

541
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,660
<font color="yellow">Oh dear. She was a beauty.</font>

542
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,220
<font color="yellow">What did she do?</font>

543
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,960
<font color="yellow">She wanted to act.</font>

544
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,760
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- We met when I was...</font>

545
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,860
<font color="yellow">working at a studio.</font>

546
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,760
<font color="yellow">A bit more.</font>

547
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,660
<font color="yellow">Change the lens.</font>

548
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,760
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey, you.</font>

549
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,790
<font color="yellow">Don't just stand there.</font>

550
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,320
<font color="yellow">- Snap out of it.
- I'm sorry.</font>

551
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,060
<font color="yellow">- Change the lens.
- Okay.</font>

552
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,160
<font color="yellow">It wasn't easy...</font>

553
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,660
<font color="yellow">but she worked hard.</font>

554
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,060
<font color="yellow">Then she suddenly killed herself.</font>

555
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,560
<font color="yellow">She was found in a lake. She left a note behind.</font>

556
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,060
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

557
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,490
<font color="yellow">why exactly are you here?</font>

558
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,430
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

559
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,160
<font color="yellow">find her.</font>

560
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,860
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

561
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,960
<font color="yellow">Wait, what?</font>

562
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,660
<font color="yellow">You want us to find a woman who died 20 years ago?</font>

563
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,220
<font color="yellow">Yes. She killed herself 20 years ago.</font>

564
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,160
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought.</font>

565
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
<font color="yellow">I took this...</font>

566
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,120
<font color="yellow">20 years ago on the last day we met.</font>

567
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,690
<font color="yellow">We used to date at this cafe often.</font>

568
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
<font color="yellow">Da Hye.</font>

569
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,960
<font color="yellow">Ever since she died,</font>

570
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,430
<font color="yellow">I went to the cafe sometimes.</font>

571
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,160
<font color="yellow">20 years have passed,</font>

572
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,520
<font color="yellow">but the cafe is still there.</font>

573
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,320
<font color="yellow">A few days ago...</font>

574
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,120
<font color="yellow">I went there, out of habit.</font>

575
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,960
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

576
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,960
<font color="yellow">This is the photo I took that day.</font>

577
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
<font color="yellow">I think she's still alive.</font>

578
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,220
<font color="yellow">Please find...</font>

579
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,160
<font color="yellow">Da Hye, or whoever this woman may be.</font>

580
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,220
<font color="yellow">A few days ago,</font>

581
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,960
<font color="yellow">a young woman came to a store with a diamond necklace.</font>

582
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,320
<font color="yellow">A pear-shaped diamond.</font>

583
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,060
<font color="yellow">I thought it could be the one from the break-ins.</font>

584
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,260
<font color="yellow">This one.</font>

585
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is the one.</font>

586
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,620
<font color="yellow">Who brought it?</font>

587
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,160
<font color="yellow">She looked about 20.</font>

588
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'd say she was about 20 years old.</font>

589
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,760
<font color="yellow">A 20-year-old woman...</font>

590
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,120
<font color="yellow">Can I see the tapes from your security camera?</font>

591
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,660
<font color="yellow">That's her.</font>

592
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,590
<font color="yellow">- This woman?
- Yes.</font>

593
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,260
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

594
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,890
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

595
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,690
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

596
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,160
<font color="yellow">I want to sell this.</font>

597
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,960
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this?</font>

598
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
<font color="yellow">It was a gift.</font>

599
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,790
<font color="yellow">Your boyfriend must be rich.</font>

600
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,760
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to sell it?</font>

601
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,660
<font color="yellow">If you aren't interested...</font>

602
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,690
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

603
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,560
<font color="yellow">Eight bills.</font>

604
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,360
<font color="yellow">Eight...</font>

605
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,960
<font color="yellow">thousand dollars?</font>

606
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,560
<font color="yellow">You have no idea what this is, do you?</font>

607
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,560
<font color="yellow">This is worth...</font>

608
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,590
<font color="yellow">at least 80,000 dollars.</font>

609
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,260
<font color="yellow">What's that next to the box?</font>

610
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,660
<font color="yellow">- What?
- This black square.</font>

611
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,860
<font color="yellow">Oh, that?</font>

612
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,590
<font color="yellow">It was in the box.</font>

613
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,060
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

614
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,160
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a floppy disk?</font>

615
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,260
<font color="yellow">A floppy disk.</font>

616
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,620
<font color="yellow">They detected a large-scale...</font>

617
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,390
<font color="yellow">corruption scandal regarding the development of Jinyang City.</font>

618
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,690
<font color="yellow">Of all the things that Han Se Kyu stole,</font>

619
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,760
<font color="yellow">something could be used to prove someone else's corruption.</font>

620
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,220
<font color="yellow">Do you have it? Did she take it?</font>

621
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,420
<font color="yellow">She took it.</font>

622
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,660
<font color="yellow">Did she leave anything? Like a contact number?</font>

623
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,720
<font color="yellow">She did leave a number,</font>

624
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,060
<font color="yellow">but it didn't exist.</font>

625
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,790
<font color="yellow">- It didn't exist?
- No.</font>

626
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,590
<font color="yellow">I had my doubts that she'd leave a valid number,</font>

627
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,760
<font color="yellow">and I was right.</font>

628
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,860
<font color="yellow">People who bring stolen goods would never leave a contact number.</font>

629
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,860
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

630
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,120
<font color="yellow">Kim Beom Joo, you scumbag.</font>

631
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,220
<font color="yellow">I'll take the contact information.</font>

632
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,790
<font color="yellow">Let's delete the security footage.</font>

633
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,390
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

634
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,920
<font color="yellow">These are the documents from the head office.</font>

635
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,860
<font color="yellow">Forget documents. Get out there and catch the perp.</font>

636
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,320
<font color="yellow">You lazy punks.</font>

637
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,960
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

638
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,120
<font color="yellow">Are you doing any work?</font>

639
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,220
<font color="yellow">Soo Hyun.</font>

640
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,490
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- Come to the parking lot.</font>

641
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,760
<font color="yellow">Let's practise driving.</font>

642
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,820
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

643
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,860
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

644
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,290
<font color="yellow">No one cares if you're not at your desk, right?</font>

645
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,190
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

646
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,660
<font color="yellow">The women's night duty room has a phone, right?</font>

647
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,820
<font color="yellow">Yes. It does, but...</font>

648
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,560
<font color="yellow">why?</font>

649
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,690
<font color="yellow">I need to find a phone number.</font>

650
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,920
<font color="yellow">- Watch the road.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

651
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,490
<font color="yellow">The last two numbers are likely wrong.</font>

652
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,060
<font color="yellow">Call them all,</font>

653
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,090
<font color="yellow">and find the one that has a woman in her 20s.</font>

654
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,920
<font color="yellow">Is that all?</font>

655
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,460
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

656
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,060
<font color="yellow">What? Do you not want to do it?</font>

657
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,220
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

658
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,660
<font color="yellow">Different phone numbers. A woman in her 20s.</font>

659
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,090
<font color="yellow">That is enough information.</font>

660
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,490
<font color="yellow">This is a top secret...</font>

661
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,790
<font color="yellow">between the two of us.</font>

662
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,060
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

663
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,790
<font color="yellow">Hello? A bathhouse?</font>

664
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,390
<font color="yellow">How old is your grandchild?</font>

665
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,990
<font color="yellow">24?</font>

666
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,790
<font color="yellow">It's a grandson?</font>

667
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,690
<font color="yellow">Hi, kid. Thank you.</font>

668
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,320
<font color="yellow">An aunt? A grandmother?</font>

669
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,990
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

670
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,090
<font color="yellow">This isn't a prank call! Don't hang up!</font>

671
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:39,760
<font color="yellow">I found them.</font>

672
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,220
<font color="yellow">Of the 100 phone numbers with 2 different digits,</font>

673
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,660
<font color="yellow">there were 24 residences.</font>

674
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,460
<font color="yellow">Of them, only 5 had a woman in her 20s living there.</font>

675
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,290
<font color="yellow">Shall we head into the city then?</font>

676
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,020
<font color="yellow">- Me?
- The handle!</font>

677
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,960
<font color="yellow">- Look straight.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

678
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,690
<font color="yellow">You should stay in the car.</font>

679
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,490
<font color="yellow">I found them.</font>

680
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,020
<font color="yellow">I want to see who we are searching for.</font>

681
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,190
<font color="yellow">But who are you searching for?</font>

682
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,920
<font color="yellow">(JINSOO-DONG 238-5)</font>

683
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,310
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

684
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:09,650
<font color="yellow">He isn't that old.</font>

685
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:14,150
<font color="yellow">I heard many young people get Alzheimer's lately.</font>

686
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,480
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

687
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,380
<font color="yellow">We should've found him a good hospital or something.</font>

688
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:22,080
<font color="yellow">The photo did look similar to his late fiancee.</font>

689
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,010
<font color="yellow">According to the angle and lighting of the photograph,</font>

690
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,780
<font color="yellow">completely different people can look alike.</font>

691
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

692
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,910
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

693
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,180
<font color="yellow">How could he not forget 1 person for 20 years?</font>

694
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,380
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

695
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,180
<font color="yellow">Not unless they ran off with your money.</font>

696
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,680
<font color="yellow">He may not forget.</font>

697
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,580
<font color="yellow">That's impossible.</font>

698
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,880
<font color="yellow">People come and go all the time.</font>

699
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,080
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

700
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,150
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

701
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:55,580
<font color="yellow">You too.</font>

702
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,980
<font color="yellow">- What?
- This case.</font>

703
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,480
<font color="yellow">I'm against it.</font>

704
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,780
<font color="yellow">So am I.</font>

705
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,580
<font color="yellow">The body was already cremated.</font>

706
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,480
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
- There isn't enough...</font>

707
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,750
<font color="yellow">scientific evidence.</font>

708
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,310
<font color="yellow">There may be evidence at the cafe where the photo was taken.</font>

709
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,680
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this again?</font>

710
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,050
<font color="yellow">Think of how many people go in and out every day.</font>

711
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,210
<font color="yellow">There couldn't be any evidence remaining.</font>

712
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,480
<font color="yellow">We won't know until we look.</font>

713
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,280
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Forget it.</font>

714
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,680
<font color="yellow">Don't bother with other people's love lives and...</font>

715
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,210
<font color="yellow">let's take Oh Dae Han's case.</font>

716
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,180
<font color="yellow">This is a true cold case.</font>

717
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,780
<font color="yellow">If what he says is true,</font>

718
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,810
<font color="yellow">the body found in the lake was...</font>

719
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,780
<font color="yellow">an unidentified body.</font>

720
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,010
<font color="yellow">That makes this a cold case as well.</font>

721
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:36,110
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she is impossible to talk to.</font>

722
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,080
<font color="yellow">What about you, Lieutenant Park?</font>

723
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,110
<font color="yellow">- You're against it, right?
- Of course, he is.</font>

724
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,380
<font color="yellow">Kids these days aren't into devotion.</font>

725
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,450
<font color="yellow">How do you know...</font>

726
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,080
<font color="yellow">Detective Lee Jae Han?</font>

727
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,050
<font color="yellow">Why are you interested in my senior officer?</font>

728
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,710
<font color="yellow">Senior officer?</font>

729
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,950
<font color="yellow">I used to work with him back in the day.</font>

730
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,750
<font color="yellow">Why did you go to her funeral?</font>

731
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,050
<font color="yellow">- Are you interrogating me?
- I'm asking because of this case.</font>

732
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,180
<font color="yellow">Why did you go to Shin Da Hye's home?</font>

733
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,910
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it was for the investigation.</font>

734
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,980
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

735
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,580
<font color="yellow">I don't know the details,</font>

736
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,650
<font color="yellow">but he said he was looking for the stolen goods.</font>

737
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:26,980
<font color="yellow">The stolen goods?</font>

738
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,080
<font color="yellow">Did you ask him which one?</font>

739
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,080
<font color="yellow">He was looking for a blue diamond.</font>

740
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:37,880
<font color="yellow">The stolen goods went missing.</font>

741
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,850
<font color="yellow">It's a diamond necklace.</font>

742
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,680
<font color="yellow">It hides...</font>

743
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,850
<font color="yellow">a bigger secret.</font>

744
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,380
<font color="yellow">Detective Lee Jae Han was...</font>

745
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,110
<font color="yellow">chasing that stolen good all by himself.</font>

746
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,480
<font color="yellow">This case is related to Han Se Kyu.</font>

747
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,210
<font color="yellow">You're making me nervous. Why are you asking so many questions?</font>

748
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,910
<font color="yellow">Was that after the real thief Han Se Kyu...</font>

749
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,850
<font color="yellow">was arrested?</font>

750
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,880
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

751
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,080
<font color="yellow">You won't take on this case, will you?</font>

752
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,210
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

753
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,810
<font color="yellow">I'll clean up now.</font>

754
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,480
<font color="yellow">Let's do it.</font>

755
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:17,810
<font color="yellow">Shall we vote on it?</font>

756
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,610
<font color="yellow">- I'm in.
- I'm out.</font>

757
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:20,710
<font color="yellow">I'm also out.</font>

758
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,610
<font color="yellow">- I'm in.
- It's 2 for 2. It's done.</font>

759
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,750
<font color="yellow">May I...</font>

760
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,810
<font color="yellow">I'm in as well.</font>

761
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,250
<font color="yellow">Who are you to vote?</font>

762
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:30,350
<font color="yellow">He's our rookie.</font>

763
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,610
<font color="yellow">So it's 2.5 to 2.</font>

764
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:37,410
<font color="yellow">I'll meet with Yoo, so you gather the evidence.</font>

765
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:40,810
<font color="yellow">Get Shin Da Hye's bank and credit card records.</font>

766
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:41,910
<font color="yellow">You come with me.</font>

767
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:46,510
<font color="yellow">Hwang Ui Kyeong, get over here.</font>

768
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,710
<font color="yellow">- Get over here. How dare you?
- I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

769
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,710
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

770
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,110
<font color="yellow">I told you, I don't work with people who have secrets.</font>

771
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,410
<font color="yellow">So, tell me the truth.</font>

772
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,710
<font color="yellow">There you go again.</font>

773
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,110
<font color="yellow">How do you know...</font>

774
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,310
<font color="yellow">Lee Jae Han?</font>

775
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:15,610
<font color="yellow">I told you. He has the same name as someone I know.</font>

776
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,110
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to meet with the family of the deceased?</font>

777
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,710
<font color="yellow">I should meet with the detective on the case, right?</font>

778
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,510
<font color="yellow">I'll go first. I'll see you later.</font>

779
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,610
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to eat.</font>

780
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,310
<font color="yellow">He asked me...</font>

781
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:36,380
<font color="yellow">if I knew Detective Lee Jae Han from Homicide in Jinyang.</font>

782
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,480
<font color="yellow">I heard you were the detective on the unnatural death case.</font>

783
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,080
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

784
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,510
<font color="yellow">I received the case file from back then...</font>

785
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,110
<font color="yellow">and I had some questions.</font>

786
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,710
<font color="yellow">I read that a fisherman found the body...</font>

787
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,810
<font color="yellow">and that the body was identified using ID found in the wallet...</font>

788
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,110
<font color="yellow">in the pocket.</font>

789
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,010
<font color="yellow">It's as it says.</font>

790
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,210
<font color="yellow">The body must have deteriorated significantly.</font>

791
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,710
<font color="yellow">How was the family so sure it was their family member?</font>

792
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:11,610
<font color="yellow">They said the clothes and items found on the body was hers.</font>

793
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,810
<font color="yellow">But I don't understand something.</font>

794
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,910
<font color="yellow">Shin Da Hye's home was in Seoul.</font>

795
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:19,910
<font color="yellow">It's an hour and a half away.</font>

796
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:24,510
<font color="yellow">Are you saying she came all the way here in her pyjamas and a jacket?</font>

797
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,110
<font color="yellow">You're right. I thought that was suspicious too.</font>

798
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,010
<font color="yellow">I thought it may not have been a suicide.</font>

799
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,110
<font color="yellow">That's why I requested an autopsy,</font>

800
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:37,210
<font color="yellow">but the family adamantly refused.</font>

801
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,310
<font color="yellow">The family did?</font>

802
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,210
<font color="yellow">I hear you still take care of your mother.</font>

803
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,750
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

804
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:48,810
<font color="yellow">I'd like to meet her.</font>

805
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,910
<font color="yellow">I can go to your place.</font>

806
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,710
<font color="yellow">Mother is ill,</font>

807
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,450
<font color="yellow">so she's in the hospital.</font>

808
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,510
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

809
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,810
<font color="yellow">may I visit her at the hospital?</font>

810
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,410
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid not.</font>

811
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,410
<font color="yellow">She is very ill...</font>

812
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,110
<font color="yellow">and is in the ICU.</font>

813
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,310
<font color="yellow">I heard you're the one who identified...</font>

814
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,410
<font color="yellow">Shin Da Hye's body.</font>

815
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,810
<font color="yellow">How were you sure that...</font>

816
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,510
<font color="yellow">the body was Shin Da Hye?</font>

817
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,810
<font color="yellow">Her height and hair length were the same as my sister.</font>

818
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,810
<font color="yellow">She was wearing her clothes, too.</font>

819
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,080
<font color="yellow">May I see...</font>

820
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,410
<font color="yellow">some of Shin Da Hye's belongings?</font>

821
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,810
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

822
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,510
<font color="yellow">We burned them all.</font>

823
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:53,910
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

824
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,680
<font color="yellow">You burned everything that belonged to her?</font>

825
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,310
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

826
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,810
<font color="yellow">It was too hard on my mum.</font>

827
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,910
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I wasn't of help.</font>

828
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,710
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a suicide.</font>

829
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,010
<font color="yellow">Most suicide locations are...</font>

830
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,110
<font color="yellow">places that hold meaning or in close proximity.</font>

831
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:18,110
<font color="yellow">But Shin Da Hye and Migang City have no relation.</font>

832
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,310
<font color="yellow">Plus, if she went to the lake in order to commit suicide,</font>

833
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:25,610
<font color="yellow">it would've been premeditated, not spontaneous.</font>

834
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:27,550
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

835
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,610
<font color="yellow">she was wearing pyjamas and a jacket.</font>

836
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,610
<font color="yellow">Nothing makes sense.</font>

837
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,950
<font color="yellow">It is very likely that...</font>

838
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,280
<font color="yellow">somebody killed Shin Da Hye and made it look like a suicide.</font>

839
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:43,910
<font color="yellow">The family, too.</font>

840
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,710
<font color="yellow">The detective requested an autopsy,</font>

841
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,610
<font color="yellow">but the family adamantly refused.</font>

842
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,010
<font color="yellow">They are definitely hiding something.</font>

843
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,980
<font color="yellow">What did you find?</font>

844
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,350
<font color="yellow">I checked the tables, chairs, doorknobs, everything.</font>

845
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,250
<font color="yellow">We have dozens of fingerprints that overlap, so we can't find anything.</font>

846
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,480
<font color="yellow">I told you, we wouldn't find anything here.</font>

847
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:32,610
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

848
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,010
<font color="yellow">May I help you?</font>

849
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:39,550
<font color="yellow">I told you, I really didn't know the stolen goods were here.</font>

850
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,480
<font color="yellow">You know this woman, right?</font>

851
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,610
<font color="yellow">What was her relationship with Han Se Kyu?</font>

852
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,110
<font color="yellow">She had the goods that Han Se Kyu stole.</font>

853
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,180
<font color="yellow">She frequented this house, right?</font>

854
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,710
<font color="yellow">Was she his girlfriend?</font>

855
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:59,010
<font color="yellow">That brat was a total player.</font>

856
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,610
<font color="yellow">He just played her.</font>

857
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,450
<font color="yellow">Where is everyone?</font>

858
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:14,810
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

859
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,280
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

860
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,450
<font color="yellow">Get the flashlight.</font>

861
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,380
<font color="yellow">Get over here.</font>

862
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:32,810
<font color="yellow">Those little brats were so dirty.</font>

863
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:36,310
<font color="yellow">I got sick from cleaning up after them time and time again.</font>

864
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,010
<font color="yellow">Did she come after that?</font>

865
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:42,010
<font color="yellow">After the thefts. When the stolen goods were here.</font>

866
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,010
<font color="yellow">She came once, alone.</font>

867
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,110
<font color="yellow">Alone?</font>

868
01:01:58,450 --> 01:01:59,450
<font color="yellow">That's when...</font>

869
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,610
<font color="yellow">Shin Da Hye took the stolen goods.</font>

870
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,010
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you checked everything?</font>

871
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,410
<font color="yellow">I checked the table, the four chairs...</font>

872
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,410
<font color="yellow">and even the dust on the floor,</font>

873
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:16,910
<font color="yellow">but there's nothing.</font>

874
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,810
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

875
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,110
<font color="yellow">Does this book belong to the cafe?</font>

876
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,410
<font color="yellow">No, a customer left it here.</font>

877
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,910
<font color="yellow">That's right. That woman who was sitting there left it.</font>

878
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:31,610
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

879
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,810
