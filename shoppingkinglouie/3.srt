<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

8
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040

<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

20
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,040

- An ambulance came...</font>

36
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,400
<font color="yellow">for the cleaner who was cleaning the lobby. It's a big mess.</font>

37
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,140
<font color="yellow">What happened to the cleaner?</font>

38
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,970
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha hit her and she passed out.</font>

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,570
<font color="yellow">"You swindler. Give me back my money."</font>

46
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,500
<font color="yellow">As she said that, she attacked him.</font>

47
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,210
<font color="yellow">No way. Mr Cha isn't someone who would deceive others.</font>

48
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,240

49

<font color="yellow">During the day,</font>

51
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,770
<font color="yellow">a hysterical director and a mysterious swindler at night.</font>

52
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,500
<font color="yellow">Like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.</font>

53
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,970
<font color="yellow">He could be someone like that.</font>

54
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,470
<font color="yellow">I'd like to ask you a favour.</font>

55
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,340

<font color="yellow">Can you zoom in to that man?</font>

59
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,140
<font color="yellow">That's Louis.</font>

60
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,370
<font color="yellow">But he's dead.</font>

61
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,640
<font color="yellow">Who is that beggar?</font>

62
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,000
<font color="yellow">Hot fish cake soup on a rainy day.</font>

63
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,240
<font color="yellow">Isn't this great? What do you think?</font>

64
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,570
<font color="yellow">I love it.</font>

65
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,640
<font color="yellow">Now, let me get your story straight.</font>

66
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,470
<font color="yellow">When you woke up that day,</font>

67
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,100
<font color="yellow">you were wearing this fake jacket which belongs to Bok Nam,</font>

68
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,600
<font color="yellow">and sleeping next to a scary homeless man.</font>

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,340
<font color="yellow">You didn't remember anything before that, right?</font>

70
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,370
<font color="yellow">That's anaplastic amnesia.</font>

71
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,240
<font color="yellow">Didn't you have any wounds on your head?</font>

72
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,200
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think this part was swollen.</font>

73
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh.</font>

74
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,670
<font color="yellow">A part of your brain was probably injured by physical damage.</font>

75
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,170
<font color="yellow">- Are you a doctor?
- No.</font>

76
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,640
<font color="yellow">Hey. Do you really have three dollars only?</font>

77
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,140
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that the girl you live with is a cleaner at Goldline?</font>

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,300
<font color="yellow">She will get money soon.</font>

79
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,440
<font color="yellow">Now, let me see.</font>

80
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You look like a rich boy.</font>

81
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,640
<font color="yellow">You also have great skin.</font>

82
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,000
<font color="yellow">I'm 100 percent sure that you're from a rich family.</font>

83
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,540
<font color="yellow">Are you a fortune-teller?</font>

84
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,170
<font color="yellow">A fortune-teller? No. I'm not.</font>

85
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,940
<font color="yellow">What do you do then?</font>

86
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,470
<font color="yellow">- I'm a job seeker.
- What?</font>

87
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,970
<font color="yellow">I said I'm a job seeker.</font>

88
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,140
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

89
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,070
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what a job seeker is?</font>

90
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,140
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for a job. I spend my day studying.</font>

91
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,200
<font color="yellow">That's why I know many things.</font>

92
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,500
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. Can I have some more fish cake soup, please?</font>

93
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,600
<font color="yellow">- You can get as much as you want.
- Wow.</font>

94
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,370
<font color="yellow">Malnutrition?</font>

95
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,800

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

103
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,500
<font color="yellow">I just came to give her this. She left her clothes at the company.</font>

108

<font color="yellow">Don't worry, and please talk freely.</font>

110
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,540
<font color="yellow">I heard Bok Sil has been working at our company for a month.</font>

111
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,870
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow is her payday, so it's been a month.</font>

112
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,100
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil is hard-working and good at her job,</font>

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,700
<font color="yellow">but she looks a bit shabby maybe because she's poor.</font>

114
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,340

115
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,370
<font color="yellow">Today, she even borrowed money from me.</font>

116
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,810
<font color="yellow">She also said a swindler took her ginseng that is worth 5,000 dollars.</font>

117
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she's a brave girl, but she was crying her eyes out.</font>

118
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,540
<font color="yellow">I felt bad for her.</font>

119
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,200
<font color="yellow">What kind of a person deceives a young girl...</font>

120
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,370
<font color="yellow">who has just moved to Seoul and takes her ginseng?</font>

121
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,700
<font color="yellow">Someone like that should get thrown at the river,</font>

122
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,370
<font color="yellow">or get shoved into a fire pit. He must be punished.</font>

123

<font color="yellow">No one deceived...</font>

<font color="yellow">You're being a little strange.</font>

126
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,310
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking the swindler's side?</font>

127
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,470
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying everyone has their side of the story.</font>

128
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,670
<font color="yellow">That jerk should have called her at least.</font>

129
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,500
<font color="yellow">She called him a million times.</font>

130
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,070
<font color="yellow">That jerk. I will kill him if I ever see him.</font>

131

- I'm not a swindler.</font>

133
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,540
<font color="yellow">Calm down, all right?</font>

134
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,640
<font color="yellow">Why am I here?</font>

135
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,800
<font color="yellow">You suddenly passed out.</font>

136
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,070
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

137
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,170
<font color="yellow">Right. I remember you flinging me to the ground.</font>

138
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,500
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

139
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,740
<font color="yellow">I never flung you to the ground...</font>

140
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,470
<font color="yellow">or took your ginseng without paying.</font>

141
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,540
<font color="yellow">Here. Open it. You said you'd sell it at 1,000 dollars,</font>

142
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,240
<font color="yellow">but I'm paying you the proper price.</font>

143

144
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,840

145
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,900
<font color="yellow">That's the rule. Don't cry over it.</font>

146
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,800
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha. Thank you.</font>

147
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,570
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

148
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,000
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'm not a swindler, but the saviour of your ginseng.</font>

- The saviour of my ginseng.</font>

150
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,200
<font color="yellow">That's right. The saviour of your ginseng.</font>

152
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,240

153
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,270
<font color="yellow">- What did you just say?
- The merchandising department.</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't you understand me?</font>

155
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,270
<font color="yellow">What is that place?</font>

156
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,440
<font color="yellow">- Look, I...
- Stop complaining.</font>

157
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,540
<font color="yellow">Who am I?</font>

158
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,770
<font color="yellow">The saviour of my ginseng.</font>

159
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,700
<font color="yellow">Just do what your saviour says. I'll be going now.</font>

160
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,470
<font color="yellow">Rest up during the weekend. Eat a lot of meat.</font>

161
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,540
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil!</font>

162
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late? I've been waiting forever.</font>

163
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,400
<font color="yellow">Hey. I found the swindler... No. I found the saviour of my ginseng.</font>

164
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,300
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Surprise!</font>

165
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,040
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

166
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh.</font>

167
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
<font color="yellow">Where did you find him?</font>

168
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,270
<font color="yellow">At the company. Isn't that amazing?</font>

169
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,800
<font color="yellow">I was going to find him for you, but you already did.</font>

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,970
<font color="yellow">Just try to bring your memory back and find Bok Nam for me.</font>

171
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,770
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll find Bok Nam for you no matter what.</font>

172
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,970
<font color="yellow">- You can trust me.
- You're so reliable.</font>

173
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,870
<font color="yellow">- What is this?
- It's hotteok.</font>

174
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,470
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it smell nice?</font>

175
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,970
<font color="yellow">Let's eat. I'm hungry.</font>

176
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,740
<font color="yellow">Why are you eating outside? It's night-time.</font>

177
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,240
<font color="yellow">There is a bug inside.</font>

178
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,240
<font color="yellow">A bug? Where is it?</font>

179
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,240
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

180
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,240
<font color="yellow">- Where is it?
- Why isn't it there?</font>

181
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,170
<font color="yellow">- There is no bug.
- Goodness.</font>

182
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,840
<font color="yellow">- What?
- There...</font>

183
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,140
<font color="yellow">It has so many legs.</font>

184
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,800
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

185
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,400
<font color="yellow">This is a house centipede. It's a good bug.</font>

186
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,140
<font color="yellow">Don't touch it!</font>

187
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
<font color="yellow">Are you okay now?</font>

188
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,770
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

189
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,370
<font color="yellow">Have we met before?</font>

190
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,240
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Did that hotteok make you go crazy?</font>

191
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
<font color="yellow">It's late.</font>

192
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,400
<font color="yellow">Let's go to sleep. We have a lot to do tomorrow.</font>

193
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,770
<font color="yellow">I don't have an appetite.</font>

194
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,200
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, you must eat.</font>

195
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,270
<font color="yellow">You might pass out at this rate.</font>

196
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,270
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi.</font>

197
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,500
<font color="yellow">Would you like the breakfast that Mr Louis used to have?</font>

198
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,570
<font color="yellow">- What Louis used to have?
- Bring it over.</font>

199
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,200
<font color="yellow">As rice is important to Koreans,</font>

200
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,000
<font color="yellow">you told me to always serve him rice in the morning.</font>

201
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
<font color="yellow">Is this the breakfast...</font>

202
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,400
<font color="yellow">- Louis used to have?
- Yes, Ma'am.</font>

203
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,800
<font color="yellow">We always served him organic and natural food without preservatives.</font>

204
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,970
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

205
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,140
<font color="yellow">Do you want me...</font>

206
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,370
<font color="yellow">to hit you and get bruised?</font>

207
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,640
<font color="yellow">Or do you want to get a nosebleed...</font>

208
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,600
<font color="yellow">and feel the bone break in your nose?</font>

209
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,070
<font color="yellow">Did I do something wrong?</font>

210
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,040
<font color="yellow">Stay out of Ms Choi's food.</font>

211
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,100
<font color="yellow">If you ever show off again,</font>

212
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,100
<font color="yellow">you'll find out what it feels like...</font>

213
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,600
<font color="yellow">to lose all of your teeth.</font>

214
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,070
<font color="yellow">All right?</font>

215
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,900
<font color="yellow">Ms Heo.</font>

216
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,140
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

217
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,040
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

218
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,100
<font color="yellow">You are a handful.</font>

219
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,400
<font color="yellow">Do you like it that much?</font>

220
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,870
<font color="yellow">Let's get some household goods after eating.</font>

221
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,600
<font color="yellow">Do you mean shopping?</font>

222
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,570
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

223
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,870
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

224
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,940
<font color="yellow">(FRYING PAN)</font>

225
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,540
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, that one.</font>

226
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,070
<font color="yellow">Sir?</font>

227
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,300
<font color="yellow">Sir, please give us this one.</font>

228
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Bok Sil.</font>

229
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,100
<font color="yellow">I love it here.</font>

230
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,270
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

231
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, how come...</font>

232
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,800
<font color="yellow">you're so good at shopping?</font>

233
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,570
<font color="yellow">You have a good eye.</font>

234
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,300
<font color="yellow">They talk to me. They ask me to buy them.</font>

235
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,970
<font color="yellow">You're definitely crazy.</font>

236
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,900
<font color="yellow">Let's go shopping for clothes. I have a reputation to keep.</font>

237
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,700
<font color="yellow">I can't keep wearing this imitation.</font>

238
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,370
<font color="yellow">Where did your brother find such a jacket?</font>

239
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,270
<font color="yellow">I bought it for him for 20 dollars.</font>

240
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,600
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

241
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,970
<font color="yellow">It was part of Louis Ssaton's SS collection.</font>

242
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,510
<font color="yellow">As a limited edition,</font>

243
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,340
<font color="yellow">additional 100 jackets were launched.</font>

244
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,700
<font color="yellow">These jackets were numbered...</font>

245
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,940
<font color="yellow">from 1 to 100.</font>

246
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,040
<font color="yellow">The jacket with number 1 is over 10,000 dollars.</font>

247
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,770
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what you're saying.</font>

248
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,510
<font color="yellow">What I mean is...</font>

249
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,770
<font color="yellow">You don't know too many things.</font>

250
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,540
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

251
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,600
<font color="yellow">I have to go shopping now.</font>

252
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,340
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

253
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,370
<font color="yellow">Do I look okay?</font>

254
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,100
<font color="yellow">It looks cute on you.</font>

255
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,740
<font color="yellow">Wow, you look pretty.</font>

256
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:52,070
<font color="yellow">We haven't even bought rice, but we already bought so much.</font>

257
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,240
<font color="yellow">Oh, let's buy mobile phones.</font>

258
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,440
<font color="yellow">With a mobile phone,</font>

259
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,040
<font color="yellow">we can buy anything we need while lying down at home.</font>

260
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,640
<font color="yellow">They even deliver goods to your home.</font>

261
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,770
<font color="yellow">There's no such thing.</font>

262
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,670
<font color="yellow">Are you stupid?</font>

263
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,070
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling stupid?</font>

264
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,670
<font color="yellow">Look, everyone is using a mobile phone.</font>

265
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,470
<font color="yellow">You can do anything with that.</font>

266
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,270
<font color="yellow">Look, you can shop, watch TV,</font>

267
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,440
<font color="yellow">take photos and make phone calls.</font>

268
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,600
<font color="yellow">Buy me a mobile phone.</font>

269
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,570
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one who doesn't have it in my class.</font>

270
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,100
<font color="yellow">You can use the internet, chat with friends,</font>

271
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,770
<font color="yellow">watch TV and play all kinds of mobile games.</font>

272
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,100
<font color="yellow">Please, Bok Sil.</font>

273
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,940
<font color="yellow">You're saying the same thing Bok Nam said.</font>

274
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,370
<font color="yellow">That's right. Bok Nam.</font>

275
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,670
<font color="yellow">If he has a mobile phone, you can track down his location.</font>

276
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,400
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

277
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,370
<font color="yellow">These two phones are under your name, Ma'am.</font>

278
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,770
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

279
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,300
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

280
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,540
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Stop!</font>

281
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh, stop it.</font>

282
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,840
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

283
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,500
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

284
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,400
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

285
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,470
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

286
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,740
<font color="yellow">Please help me. It's so exhausting.</font>

287
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,240
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- You eat so much.</font>

288
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,340
<font color="yellow">Where does all the energy go? Give it to me.</font>

289
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,800
<font color="yellow">- I've never felt like this before.
- Feel like what?</font>

290
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,500
<font color="yellow">It's heavy, my arms hurt, I'm sweating and short on breath.</font>

291
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's exhausting.</font>

292
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,340
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

293
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,140
<font color="yellow">- You startled me. In Sung.
- Hello.</font>

294
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,140
<font color="yellow">You must be Bok Sil.</font>

295
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,740
<font color="yellow">He's our neighbour. He lives downstairs.</font>

296
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,940
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.</font>

297
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,900
<font color="yellow">I'm In Sung. Jo In Sung.</font>

298
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,540
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

299
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,440
<font color="yellow">You're prettier than I thought.</font>

300
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,300
<font color="yellow">You look tough, too.</font>

301
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,240
<font color="yellow">Are you in your early 20s?</font>

302
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,670
<font color="yellow">You don't wear make-up?</font>

303
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,700
<font color="yellow">- No.
- I see.</font>

304
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,600
<font color="yellow">Isn't he amazing?</font>

305
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,200
<font color="yellow">He's not a fortune-teller, but he knows a lot.</font>

306
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,870
<font color="yellow">What was it? He's a job...</font>

307
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,100
<font color="yellow">A job... What was it again?</font>

308
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,200
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

309
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,800
<font color="yellow">- I'm a job seeker.
- What?</font>

310
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,900
<font color="yellow">I'm a job seeker.</font>

311
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,400
<font color="yellow">A job seeker?</font>

312
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,870
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're looking for jobs.</font>

313
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,200
<font color="yellow">Isn't that awesome?</font>

314
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,840
<font color="yellow">- Did you go shopping?
- Yes.</font>

315
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,200
<font color="yellow">- We couldn't carry any more.
- I see.</font>

316
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,570
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to help you?</font>

317
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,040
<font color="yellow">(MAXIM GOLD)</font>

318
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,340
<font color="yellow">- Please deliver them to here.
- Okay.</font>

319
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,970
<font color="yellow">Detective.</font>

320
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,970
<font color="yellow">I'll give you my number.</font>

321
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,670
<font color="yellow">You finally bought one.</font>

322
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,570
<font color="yellow">This is great. Did you get your salary?</font>

323
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,340
<font color="yellow">Yes, I got paid and got money for ginseng too.</font>

324
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,070
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, you'll finally live properly.</font>

325
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,500
<font color="yellow">Detective.</font>

326
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,240
<font color="yellow">I heard if you have a mobile phone, you can find Bok Nam.</font>

327
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,340
<font color="yellow">Please find him.</font>

328
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,200
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

329
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,370
<font color="yellow">It's the other way around.</font>

330
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,140
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam has to have a mobile phone for us to track him.</font>

331
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

332
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,300
<font color="yellow">Well, how is the homeless guy? Is he okay to handle?</font>

333
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,970
<font color="yellow">Guys, you have a delivery.</font>

334
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,770
<font color="yellow">Wow, this is a great partition.</font>

335
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,840
<font color="yellow">We have a plastic one. Yours is much prettier.</font>

336
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,840
<font color="yellow">Why did she put up a curtain?</font>

337
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,270
<font color="yellow">- Have you never used this before?
- No.</font>

338
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,940
<font color="yellow">I used to make a fire in the furnace.</font>

339
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
<font color="yellow">Furnace?</font>

340
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,570
<font color="yellow">- The one you burn firewood?
- Yes.</font>

341
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,840
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil does everything so well.</font>

342
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,970
<font color="yellow">Look how quick her hands are.</font>

343
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,900
<font color="yellow">She's very mature for her age.</font>

344
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,170
<font color="yellow">I know, right? She will make a great maid.</font>

345
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,370
<font color="yellow">- A maid?
- Yes.</font>

346
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,140
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

347
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,340
<font color="yellow">What does it say?</font>

348
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,200
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Take a look at them.</font>

349
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,840
<font color="yellow">They have an English writing on the back.</font>

350
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,570
<font color="yellow">"Louis"? Give me.</font>

351
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,300
<font color="yellow">This is a designer label.</font>

352
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,240
<font color="yellow">- It has gems on it. Gosh.
- Really?</font>

353
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,240
<font color="yellow">What? This brand doesn't make underwear.</font>

354
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,800
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

355
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,900
<font color="yellow">"Louis"... Louis.</font>

356
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,100
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

357
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,200
<font color="yellow">Maybe that's your name.</font>

358
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,470
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. He's not in the army.</font>

359
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,470
<font color="yellow">No one has their name on their underwear.</font>

360
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,040
<font color="yellow">But the name Louis suits you. You should name yourself that.</font>

361
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,200
<font color="yellow">- Should I?
- Yes.</font>

362
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,240
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

363
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,240
<font color="yellow">Mum. Did Louis have a twin brother?</font>

364
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,570
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? He was an only child.</font>

365
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,270
<font color="yellow">Were there any secrets about his birth?</font>

366
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,970
<font color="yellow">Maybe he had a twin brother or just a brother.</font>

367
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,100
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri. What's going on?</font>

368
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,340
<font color="yellow">I saw a beggar at the company who looked just like Louis.</font>

369
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,900
<font color="yellow">Unless he reincarnated as a beggar, it's not him.</font>

370
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,870
<font color="yellow">It must be just someone who looks similar.</font>

371
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,440
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. I need to go to my office to take care of...</font>

372
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,670
<font color="yellow">some urgent business.</font>

373
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,140
<font color="yellow">You can drive, right?</font>

374
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

375
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,140
<font color="yellow">He just left.</font>

376
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,840
<font color="yellow">Louis is dead.</font>

377
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,400
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

378
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,740
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so good.</font>

379
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,040
<font color="yellow">- It's undercooked.
- I don't mind.</font>

380
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,800
<font color="yellow">- That's mine.
- Finding's keeping.</font>

381
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,740
<font color="yellow">It will burn. Flip it.</font>

382
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,400
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

383
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,200
<font color="yellow">I will be...</font>

384
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,770
<font color="yellow">working at Merchandising Department from tomorrow.</font>

385
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,840
<font color="yellow">What do people do there?</font>

386
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,040
<font color="yellow">- I thought you were a cleaner.
- Well...</font>

387
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,570
<font color="yellow">Someone with a high rank told me to start working there.</font>

388
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,200
<font color="yellow">Is that the saviour of your ginseng?</font>

389
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,840
<font color="yellow">That's just a trick before he fires you.</font>

390
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,870
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Many companies use that trick.</font>

391
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,370
<font color="yellow">He wants to fire you, but it will make him look bad.</font>

392
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,470
<font color="yellow">He also needs to pay compensation.</font>

393
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,300
<font color="yellow">If you insist that you won't leave,</font>

394
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,900
<font color="yellow">that will be so much trouble for the company.</font>

395
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,770
<font color="yellow">That's when they move you to a whole different department.</font>

396
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,740
<font color="yellow">What would happen?</font>

397
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,270
<font color="yellow">You'll be bad at your job, become passive and won't be able to fit in.</font>

398
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,300
<font color="yellow">You'll feel like you're useless,</font>

399
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,640
<font color="yellow">and your self-esteem will hit rock bottom.</font>

400
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,170
<font color="yellow">You will end up quitting even if they ask you not to.</font>

401
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:48,100
<font color="yellow">Are you saying he moved Bok Sil to another department to fire her?</font>

402
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,370
<font color="yellow">That's right. That's more convenient for the company.</font>

403
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,540
<font color="yellow">- Bok Sil. Cut the meat.
- Okay.</font>

404
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,540
<font color="yellow">Come on. He could've just fired her. Why would he go through all that?</font>

405
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,470
<font color="yellow">I think he recruited her because she's good at her job.</font>

406
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,900
<font color="yellow">What a beautiful young man. Did you have a sheltered life?</font>

407
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,970
<font color="yellow">But he paid for my ginseng.</font>

408
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,340
<font color="yellow">He may be an honest and kind-hearted man.</font>

409
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,940
<font color="yellow">Maybe because you lived in the backwoods,</font>

410
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,500
<font color="yellow">you have no idea how things work.</font>

411
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,070
<font color="yellow">You accused him as a swindler. He just paid you to keep you silent.</font>

412
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,740
<font color="yellow">I guess you wouldn't know how the big companies work.</font>

413
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,840
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I thought it was strange that you didn't ask for food.</font>

414
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,540
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Mum.
- You were eating here.</font>

415
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,100
<font color="yellow">It's pork belly.</font>

416
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,170
<font color="yellow">I like pork neck better.</font>

417
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,470
<font color="yellow">- Please eat up.
- All right.</font>

418
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,870
<font color="yellow">You should cook it a bit longer.</font>

419
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,300
<font color="yellow">Hey. Don't you have any sauce?</font>

420
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,800
<font color="yellow">I'll go and get it.</font>

421
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,640
<font color="yellow">Eat up, Mum.</font>

422
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,740
<font color="yellow">- This is delicious.
- It is.</font>

423
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,770
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil should eat it.</font>

424
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,940
<font color="yellow">How petty. It's just a few pieces of meat.</font>

425
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,440
<font color="yellow">Fine. I won't eat it.</font>

426
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,940
<font color="yellow">You're so cheap. Gosh.</font>

427
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,800
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving already?</font>

428
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,300
<font color="yellow">Your burden won't let me eat. I'll just go home.</font>

429
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,740
<font color="yellow">Burden? Me?</font>

430
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,040
<font color="yellow">You are, aren't you?</font>

431
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,040
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the meal.</font>

432
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,470
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- See you.</font>

433
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,940
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

434
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,400
<font color="yellow">There are still four pieces left.</font>

435
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,270
<font color="yellow">- Mum.
- Yes?</font>

436
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,970
<font color="yellow">Don't you think they're a little slow?</font>

437
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,800
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

438
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,940
<font color="yellow">You've been jobless for 10 years saying you'll study...</font>

439
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,100
<font color="yellow">and become a public official. You're just a big idler.</font>

440
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,840
<font color="yellow">You're not so quick-witted yourself.</font>

441
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,940
<font color="yellow">Go out and make even just a dollar.</font>

442
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,500
<font color="yellow">It's my wish that you buy me a meal with the money you make.</font>

443
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,000
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Are you asleep?</font>

444
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,300
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

445
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,800
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking?</font>

446
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,500
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about Bok Nam.</font>

447
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,800
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam loves meat.</font>

448
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,370
<font color="yellow">I wonder if he's eating well. I'm worried.</font>

449
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,240
<font color="yellow">If my memory comes back,</font>

450
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,170
<font color="yellow">I will find your brother for you. Trust me.</font>

451
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,470
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

452
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,400
<font color="yellow">We don't have a closet,</font>

453
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,940
<font color="yellow">or a refrigerator.</font>

454
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,740
<font color="yellow">We still have a lot to buy.</font>

455
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,070
<font color="yellow">I'll order them all,</font>

456
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,740
<font color="yellow">so don't worry and go to sleep.</font>

457
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,600
<font color="yellow">You have to go to work tomorrow.</font>

458
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,540
<font color="yellow">Good night,</font>

459
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,940
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

460
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,370
<font color="yellow">"Louis".</font>

461
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,440
<font color="yellow">She called my name.</font>

462
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you following me?</font>

463
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,700
<font color="yellow">Don't you say you want to come with me.</font>

464
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,040
<font color="yellow">I like the flower pattern,</font>

465
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,410
<font color="yellow">but the fabric and the design are so old-fashioned.</font>

466
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,740
<font color="yellow">Yes. Indeed.</font>

467
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,000
<font color="yellow">- Wear the one you bought yesterday.
- No.</font>

468
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,000
<font color="yellow">Wow. She is actually quite stubborn.</font>

469
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,570
<font color="yellow">Hey. Are you here to get on the bus with me?</font>

470
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,840
<font color="yellow">Wear this at least.</font>

471
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,300
<font color="yellow">Details like this are what completes a look.</font>

472
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,640
<font color="yellow">This makes your old-fashioned style look better.</font>

473
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,440
<font color="yellow">It looks great on you.</font>

474
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,640
<font color="yellow">Have a good day!</font>

475
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,840
<font color="yellow">Don't come home late!</font>

476
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,600
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

477
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're that cleaning lady who was taken to the emergency room.</font>

478
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

479
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,870
<font color="yellow">- Are you here to clean our office?
- Well...</font>

480
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,940
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Mr Cha.</font>

481
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,540
<font color="yellow">Ms Ko Bok Sil here will be working with us starting today.</font>

482
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,800
<font color="yellow">Say hello to everyone.</font>

483
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,270
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. I'm Ko Bok Sil.</font>

484
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,410
<font color="yellow">I look forward to working with you.</font>

485
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,140
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee. You said we're short-staffed, right?</font>

486
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,410
<font color="yellow">- Yes, but...
- Ms Ko will...</font>

487
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,240
<font color="yellow">take care of our administrative tasks,</font>

488
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,910
<font color="yellow">- so use her help wisely.
- Okay.</font>

489
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,700
<font color="yellow">- Do Jin.
- Yes.</font>

490
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,240
<font color="yellow">Go to the support team's office and get a laptop for Ms Ko.</font>

491
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,070
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

492
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,570
<font color="yellow">Go fill out your forms and get your employee card.</font>

493
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,940
<font color="yellow">Follow him.</font>

494
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

495
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,070
<font color="yellow">We'll have her intern with us for a month...</font>

496
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,670
<font color="yellow">and decide whether to hire her on a full-time basis or not,</font>

497
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,070
<font color="yellow">so consider yourselves informed.</font>

498
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,870
<font color="yellow">- Prepare for the meeting at 10am.
- Okay.</font>

499
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,910
<font color="yellow">Sure thing.</font>

500
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,240
<font color="yellow">What is this preposterous situation?</font>

501
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,200
<font color="yellow">Goodness gracious.</font>

502
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,940
<font color="yellow">Does Mr Cha have a crush on her or something?</font>

503
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,000
<font color="yellow">- No way!
- Mr Lee, that is nonsense.</font>

504
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,840
<font color="yellow">I heard that you're working on promotions for the fall.</font>

505
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,240
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

506
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,770
<font color="yellow">We're launching a mobile UI with a more curated product selection,</font>

507
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,740
<font color="yellow">so we want them to coincide with the launch.</font>

508
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,800
<font color="yellow">That sounds great.</font>

509
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,740
<font color="yellow">- Will Sunny Land open in October?
- Yes.</font>

510
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,640
<font color="yellow">We're doing our best to create a one-stop destination...</font>

511
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,910
<font color="yellow">- for shopping and entertainment.
- All right.</font>

512
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,140
<font color="yellow">I'll get back to work, then.</font>

513
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:22,970
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

514
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,200
<font color="yellow">I heard something strange from the human resources team.</font>

515
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,070
<font color="yellow">They told me that you hired one of our cleaning staff as an intern.</font>

516
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,040
<font color="yellow">What if people gossip and complain?</font>

517
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,740
<font color="yellow">She's hired for a month on a trial basis as we were short-staffed.</font>

518
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,410
<font color="yellow">I think we can try grooming her into a merchandiser.</font>

519
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,970
<font color="yellow">You don't know how to use computers?</font>

520
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

521
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,600
<font color="yellow">Then do you know how to use the internet?</font>

522
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,910
<font color="yellow">I used it a little bit in middle school.</font>

523
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,640
<font color="yellow">How can we hire someone like her?</font>

524
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,070
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even know how to use computers or the internet.</font>

525
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,340
<font color="yellow">It's like hiring an illiterate for a position at a publishing company.</font>

526
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,840
<font color="yellow">She must've used mobile shopping applications at least. Right?</font>

527
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,500
<font color="yellow">Do you own a mobile phone?</font>

528
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,640
<font color="yellow">Yes! I bought it yesterday. I've tried making calls.</font>

529
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my.
- Here.</font>

530
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, I need you to do an errand for me.</font>

531
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,410
<font color="yellow">Get an iced dark mocha with no caffeine.</font>

532
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,470
<font color="yellow">Just one.</font>

533
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,540
<font color="yellow">- I want an iced Americano.
- Then I'll get matcha latte.</font>

534
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,740
<font color="yellow">I'll get an iced Americano, too. I want a large one.</font>

535
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,940
<font color="yellow">I'd like strawberry cream frappé.</font>

536
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,200
<font color="yellow">I want caramel macchiato. The standard size, please.</font>

537
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,170
<font color="yellow">(ICED AMERICANO? DARK MOCHA? STRAWBERRY... MACCHIATO?)</font>

538
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,070
<font color="yellow">(WHAT SIZE?)</font>

539
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,840
<font color="yellow">(WHAT?)</font>

540
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,070
<font color="yellow">- Well, I can go with...
- I'll go with you.</font>

541
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,370
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, I'll help you.</font>

542
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,440
<font color="yellow">If you have any questions,</font>

543
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,600
<font color="yellow">please feel free to ask me.</font>

544
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,770
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

545
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,870
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

546
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,370
<font color="yellow">Ms Baek is just too amazing.</font>

547
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,670
<font color="yellow">She's so kind-hearted, too.</font>

548
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,740
<font color="yellow">She has everything. She's just flawless!</font>

549
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,800
<font color="yellow">It's so hard to be pretty, competent and kind at the same time.</font>

550
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,340
<font color="yellow">She's too perfect.</font>

551
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,100
<font color="yellow">All women at this company want to be like her.</font>

552
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,170
<font color="yellow">- I'd like whipped cream on it.
- Sure, that's no problem.</font>

553
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,700
<font color="yellow">- Would you like everything to go?
- Yes.</font>

554
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
<font color="yellow">Just a moment, please.</font>

555
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,100
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'd like one strawberry cream frappé...</font>

556
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,770
<font color="yellow">and one iced dark mocha.</font>

557
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,500
<font color="yellow">I also need 1 matcha latte and 2 iced Americanos.</font>

558
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,300
<font color="yellow">One of them has to be large.</font>

559
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,070
<font color="yellow">I need a standard size of caramel macchiato, as well.</font>

560
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,870
<font color="yellow">Louis Ssaton... Louis Carlos.</font>

561
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
<font color="yellow">Louis XIV.</font>

562
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,370
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, there's nothing about me.
- Louis!</font>

563
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,940
<font color="yellow">Louis, you should eat.</font>

564
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,000
<font color="yellow">It's lunchtime.</font>

565
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,070
<font color="yellow">Oh, look at this!</font>

566
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,840
<font color="yellow">Fried eggs and doenjang stew.</font>

567
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,910
<font color="yellow">- It's mine.
- There are two bowls of rice.</font>

568
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,910
<font color="yellow">Let's just eat it. Dinner is on me.</font>

569
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,540
<font color="yellow">How did you know that I'd have lunch ready?</font>

570
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,370
<font color="yellow">I can tell from Bok Sil's face.</font>

571
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,740
<font color="yellow">She's certainly the type to prepare food for her room-mate...</font>

572
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,940
<font color="yellow">before going to work.</font>

573
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,700
<font color="yellow">Impressive.</font>

574
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, you need a rice cooker.</font>

575
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,700
<font color="yellow">Then you'll be able to eat warm rice at every meal.</font>

576
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I must say...</font>

577
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,540
<font color="yellow">that Bok Sil is...</font>

578
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,910
<font color="yellow">such a great cook. Everything is so delicious.</font>

579
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,340
<font color="yellow">You're such a lucky guy.</font>

580
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,540
<font color="yellow">Doesn't your mum cook for you?</font>

581
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,270
<font color="yellow">She does.</font>

582
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,070
<font color="yellow">Only once in a while, though.</font>

583
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,100
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

584
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so full. I feel like throwing up.</font>

585
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,200
<font color="yellow">Do you have coffee here?</font>

586
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,770
<font color="yellow">I do, but I don't have any hot water.</font>

587
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,800
<font color="yellow">You just have to boil water.</font>

588
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,670
<font color="yellow">How do I do it?</font>

589
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,740
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Who are you, really?</font>

590
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,570
<font color="yellow">Buy a stove and an electric kettle.</font>

591
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,910
<font color="yellow">With a proper stove, Bok Sil will be able...</font>

592
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,740
<font color="yellow">to make side dishes and soup at the same time.</font>

593
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,770
<font color="yellow">And an electric kettle is so handy for boiling water.</font>

594
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,370
<font color="yellow">You're so knowledgeable.</font>

595
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,100
<font color="yellow">How can you know nothing about kitchen equipment?</font>

596
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,910
<font color="yellow">It must mean that you've never had to do these things.</font>

597
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,910
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

598
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,370
<font color="yellow">By any chance,</font>

599
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,940
<font color="yellow">were you locked up somewhere and only ate what someone gave you?</font>

600
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,410
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

601
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,140
<font color="yellow">He exudes too much luxurious vibe.</font>

602
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,770
<font color="yellow">He looks too healthy for that.</font>

603
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,170
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

604
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,800
<font color="yellow">He could be a spoiled kid from a super wealthy family.</font>

605
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,240
<font color="yellow">Here, this is for you.</font>

606
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,240
<font color="yellow">I'm so amazed every time I drink this.</font>

607
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,100
<font color="yellow">It's honestly so delicious.</font>

608
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,640
<font color="yellow">A super wealthy family? Forget it.</font>

609
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,070
<font color="yellow">The chairwoman's grandson.</font>

610
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,100
<font color="yellow">You know that he died from an accident, right?</font>

611
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,240
