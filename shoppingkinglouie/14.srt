<font color="yellow">Where did Seon Goo go?</font>

158
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,462
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for leaving without seeing him again.</font>

159
00:11:58,462 --> 00:12:01,632
<font color="yellow">You see each other often anyway. Take care of yourself.</font>

160
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:02,802
<font color="yellow">You, too.</font>

161
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:04,832
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, Audrey.</font>

162
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:06,832
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

163
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:37,732
<font color="yellow">- May I take a look at this?
- Certainly.</font>

164
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,802
<font color="yellow">- Are you looking for a men's ring?
- Yes.</font>

165
00:12:58,662 --> 00:12:59,732
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

166
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:06,332
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm ready to go.</font>

167
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:07,802
<font color="yellow">Where shall we go?</font>

168
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:11,232
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the warmest and the best place in the world.</font>

169
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,432
<font color="yellow">Where's that?</font>

170
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:15,662
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil's world.</font>

171
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,832
<font color="yellow">- Are we going to stay here?
- Yes.</font>

172
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,932
<font color="yellow">I missed our time we spent here together.</font>

173
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:25,102
<font color="yellow">I'll hang out with you here all day today.</font>

174
00:13:27,762 --> 00:13:28,962
<font color="yellow">What shall we do?</font>

175
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:32,162
<font color="yellow">They should arrive any minute now.</font>

176
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:34,332
<font color="yellow">- Here's your delivery.
- There it is.</font>

177
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,232
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

178
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:42,862
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Here's your delivery.</font>

179
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:44,662
<font color="yellow">- Please come in.
- Hello.</font>

180
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:45,732
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

181
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:47,332
<font color="yellow">- Here's your delivery.
- Please come in.</font>

182
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:49,562
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

183
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:00,732
<font color="yellow">Perfect. Perfect.</font>

184
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,462
<font color="yellow">Perfect? Perfect.</font>

185
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,062
<font color="yellow">Perfect. Perfect.</font>

186
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:21,462
<font color="yellow">Something seems quite familiar right now.</font>

187
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:23,032
<font color="yellow">This isn't all.</font>

188
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:27,862
<font color="yellow">- Ta-da.
- Isn't this...</font>

189
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:32,502
<font color="yellow">Perfect.</font>

190
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:36,162
<font color="yellow">This bag was made just for you. It's furry like you.</font>

191
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:39,332
<font color="yellow">- It's too expensive.
- Come on.</font>

192
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:42,102
<font color="yellow">I bought it with the money I worked hard for.</font>

193
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:45,002
<font color="yellow">You can't say no.</font>

194
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:48,232
<font color="yellow">Don't make me return it. Just accept it, please?</font>

195
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,462
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

196
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:55,662
<font color="yellow">However, you must return expensive things like this from now on,</font>

197
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,502
<font color="yellow">- so don't ever buy it again, okay?
- Okay.</font>

198
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:02,362
<font color="yellow">Go clean, you brat. Hurry up.</font>

199
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,832
<font color="yellow">Are you hungry? Do you want some ramyeon?</font>

200
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:09,832
<font color="yellow">No, don't do a thing. I'll make you something delicious.</font>

201
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:12,502
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Trust me.</font>

202
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:19,932
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

203
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:25,562
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

204
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:28,132
<font color="yellow">Yes? Wipe off your hands.</font>

205
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:34,902
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

206
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,332
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's hot.</font>

207
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:41,362
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt?</font>

208
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:45,102
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Bok Sil.</font>

209
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:01,432
<font color="yellow">Why am I so tired when you were the one who cooked?</font>

210
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:03,332
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because you're hungry.</font>

211
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:05,862
<font color="yellow">Let's eat. Then you'll get your energy back.</font>

212
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:10,862
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

213
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:17,402
<font color="yellow">- How does it taste?
- It's the best.</font>

214
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:18,532
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

215
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:21,332
<font color="yellow">- I should cook more for you.
- It's okay.</font>

216
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,562
<font color="yellow">Come on. Have some more.</font>

217
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:26,832
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Have some more.</font>

218
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:29,232
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

219
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:32,862
<font color="yellow">Now I understand why my grandma said...</font>

220
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,232
<font color="yellow">she feels satisfied just by watching me eat.</font>

221
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,232
<font color="yellow">I don't need to eat any.</font>

222
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:43,402
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you swallowing?</font>

223
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:26,232
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam.</font>

224
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:28,562
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you're familiar with the multiplication?</font>

225
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:31,962
<font color="yellow">What's 9 times 9?</font>

226
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:33,832
<font color="yellow">What's 9 times 9?</font>

227
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:35,932
<font color="yellow">An ice cream cone.</font>

228
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:55,002
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim, what's wrong with your face?</font>

229
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:56,132
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

230
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:58,332
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm aging too fast.</font>

231
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:01,232
<font color="yellow">Every hour I teach Bok Nam,</font>

232
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:03,602
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm aging one year.</font>

233
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:05,462
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

234
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,062
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't let this continue.</font>

235
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:21,862
<font color="yellow">Give me your hands.</font>

236
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,832
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for cooking.
- You're welcome.</font>

237
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,102
<font color="yellow">Ta-da. I don't want your hands...</font>

238
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:33,732
<font color="yellow">to get dry.</font>

239
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:40,132
<font color="yellow">Pay me 50 cents, too.</font>

240
00:18:40,932 --> 00:18:42,002
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

241
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,432
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

242
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,032
<font color="yellow">It smells good.</font>

243
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,202
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms Heo.</font>

244
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,032
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

245
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:05,702
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll be right there.</font>

246
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:07,832
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

247
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:12,632
<font color="yellow">- What happened?
- It's about my silly brother.</font>

248
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,232
<font color="yellow">- My brother-in-law?
- Yes, let's go.</font>

249
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,362
<font color="yellow">Stay here.</font>

250
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:34,432
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the money tomorrow, so stay here until then, okay?</font>

251
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:36,332
<font color="yellow">But your wife will be here.</font>

252
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,462
<font color="yellow">I'll tell her not to come tomorrow.</font>

253
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:41,832
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare call my house or do anything else suspicious.</font>

254
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:44,862
<font color="yellow">- You'll be doomed.
- Don't worry.</font>

255
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:55,502
<font color="yellow">Honey? Ma Ri?</font>

256
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:58,902
<font color="yellow">Isn't anyone home yet?</font>

257
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,132
<font color="yellow">It's the weekend.</font>

258
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:09,432
<font color="yellow">It'd be nice if the family gets together...</font>

259
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:10,732
<font color="yellow">and have dinner.</font>

260
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:17,332
<font color="yellow">Why is that here?</font>

261
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:22,362
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

262
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:23,832
<font color="yellow">She did this again.</font>

263
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:27,902
<font color="yellow">She always makes a mess, and covers it up with something.</font>

264
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:29,862
<font color="yellow">I don't know why she does this.</font>

265
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,402
<font color="yellow">Is this broken?</font>

266
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:54,032
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Studying is so hard.</font>

267
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:55,672
<font color="yellow">Do I have to do it?</font>

268
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:58,232
<font color="yellow">You're a student. What else are you going to do?</font>

269
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:00,702
<font color="yellow">- Should I quit being a student?
- Hey.</font>

270
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:03,202
<font color="yellow">How can you be so immature after all that?</font>

271
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:06,672
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with it? You didn't go to a university, but you're fine.</font>

272
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:07,672
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

273
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:15,332
<font color="yellow">Look at you, Slow Toad.</font>

274
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:16,702
<font color="yellow">Are you running away again?</font>

275
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:18,702
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam.</font>

276
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:22,032
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how much trouble your sister had to go through?</font>

277
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:23,702
<font color="yellow">Please give him a good scolding.</font>

278
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,432
<font color="yellow">I heard everything from outside.</font>

279
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:29,102
<font color="yellow">Listen to me, Bok Nam. You have two choices.</font>

280
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:32,362
<font color="yellow">You can either live like my son, or live like Louis.</font>

281
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:33,402
<font color="yellow">Which one do you want?</font>

282
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:35,532
<font color="yellow">- I want to live like Louis.
- That's right.</font>

283
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:38,502
<font color="yellow">It's not his family that made Louis a director.</font>

284
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:40,762
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard he studied in France?</font>

285
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:42,962
<font color="yellow">He went to one of the greatest universities in Europe,</font>

286
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,172
<font color="yellow">and he speaks 10 languages.</font>

287
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:46,632
<font color="yellow">I'll just live like In Sung, then.</font>

288
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:49,302
<font color="yellow">- I'll be Louis' chauffeur, too.
- Hey!</font>

289
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:53,102
<font color="yellow">I've been trying to be nice, but you don't seem to get it.</font>

290
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:55,462
<font color="yellow">I'm saying you should study!</font>

291
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:58,302
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. He's nothing like you.</font>

292
00:21:58,302 --> 00:21:59,432
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ms Hwang.</font>

293
00:22:00,462 --> 00:22:03,732
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the company retreat tomorrow. Please take care of him.</font>

294
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:07,402
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll turn him into a decent person by then.</font>

295
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:09,602
<font color="yellow">- Bok Sil.
- What?</font>

296
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,332
<font color="yellow">You'd better brace yourself.</font>

297
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,462
<font color="yellow">- Give me the backscratcher.
- Okay.</font>

298
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,532
<font color="yellow">You're dead.</font>

299
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:21,362
<font color="yellow">Now, open your book.</font>

300
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:24,502
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that's where you left your treasure box?</font>

301
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:26,362
<font color="yellow">Yes. I put it under the floor.</font>

302
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:29,532
<font color="yellow">Why isn't it there, then?</font>

303
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:33,932
<font color="yellow">Don't think about it too hard. You'll get wrinkles.</font>

304
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:36,502
<font color="yellow">Who do you think got me these wrinkles?</font>

305
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:38,632
<font color="yellow">You're blaming me again. Gosh.</font>

306
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:42,232
<font color="yellow">After the company retreat, I'll go to Busan and look for it with you.</font>

307
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,832
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

308
00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:45,232
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mr Louis.</font>

309
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,502
<font color="yellow">It's late. You should go to sleep.</font>

310
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,002
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

311
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,632
<font color="yellow">Good night, Bok Sil.</font>

312
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:15,402
<font color="yellow">I want to be with the real Bok Sil.</font>

313
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:19,162
<font color="yellow">Do I have to marry her for that?</font>

314
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:32,932
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

315
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:34,602
<font color="yellow">Why are you still up?</font>

316
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:36,402
<font color="yellow">Should we...</font>

317
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:38,362
<font color="yellow">get married?</font>

318
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,802
<font color="yellow">If we get married, we can be together every day.</font>

319
00:23:44,162 --> 00:23:46,102
<font color="yellow">- Do you like me that much?
- Of course.</font>

320
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:49,562
<font color="yellow">He didn't hesitate at all.</font>

321
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:52,232
<font color="yellow">You like me too, right?</font>

322
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,932
<font color="yellow">I'll answer that if you win the singing contest tomorrow.</font>

323
00:23:58,502 --> 00:23:59,562
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

324
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:02,362
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a present, too.</font>

325
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:04,232
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

326
00:24:04,632 --> 00:24:05,662
<font color="yellow">What is the present?</font>

327
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:08,762
<font color="yellow">It's a secret.</font>

328
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:10,232
<font color="yellow">Don't be surprised.</font>

329
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:12,402
<font color="yellow">I can't wait.</font>

330
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:15,532
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep or you'll be late tomorrow.</font>

331
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:18,762
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Give me a kiss.</font>

332
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:23,662
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

333
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,802
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she answering?</font>

334
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:36,702
<font color="yellow">(Louis)</font>

335
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:45,232
<font color="yellow">What now? I just gave you a kiss.</font>

336
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:46,862
<font color="yellow">You didn't.</font>

337
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:55,032
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Did you give your phone a kiss?</font>

338
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:01,302
<font color="yellow">Just go to sleep. Bye.</font>

339
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:09,932
<font color="yellow">Gosh. She just hangs up on me now.</font>

340
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:13,402
<font color="yellow">She shouldn't treat me like this.</font>

341
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,532
<font color="yellow">This is how you give me a kiss.</font>

342
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:00,962
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. It's nice.</font>

343
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:07,932
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is good. I wish Jung Ran was here.</font>

344
00:26:08,162 --> 00:26:10,762
<font color="yellow">We will now begin the company retreat...</font>

345
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:13,662
<font color="yellow">to celebrate the merger between Goldline and Singsingline.</font>

346
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:21,002
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha. I told you I would be someone who wears number one.</font>

347
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:23,502
<font color="yellow">I feel like I used to wear number one.</font>

348
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:26,962
<font color="yellow">That's right. King of Shopping, Louis bought number one.</font>

349
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,232
<font color="yellow">You're so cool, Mr Louis.</font>

350
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:31,832
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha. When did you buy this?</font>

351
00:26:31,862 --> 00:26:34,032
<font color="yellow">You were in the office with us then.</font>

352
00:26:34,562 --> 00:26:36,662
<font color="yellow">That's right. I never miss anything.</font>

353
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,732
<font color="yellow">I have my ways.</font>

354
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:42,132
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim. You're hovering again.</font>

355
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,362
<font color="yellow">- Ms Choi told me to.
- Who is that man?</font>

356
00:26:46,662 --> 00:26:48,062
<font color="yellow">He's close to Louis.</font>

357
00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:51,062
<font color="yellow">I think he got invited because he recently helped Louis a lot.</font>

358
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:52,702
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

359
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:56,232
<font color="yellow">How do you know all the important information?</font>

360
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:58,662
<font color="yellow">Are you a daughter of one of the executives?</font>

361
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,962
<font color="yellow">Well, please think as you like.</font>

362
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:10,862
<font color="yellow">First of all, we should split into two teams.</font>

363
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,002
<font color="yellow">- Take one.
- Yes!</font>

364

<font color="yellow">Who's in the First Place Team?</font>

365
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:21,332
<font color="yellow">- Me!
- Me, too. I'm with Ma Ri.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- Me!</font>

368
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:37,402
<font color="yellow">If you lose, you'll wash the dishes.</font>

369
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:40,102
<font color="yellow">The first game is...</font>

370

00:44:43,832 --> 00:44:47,332
<font color="yellow">But you said Jang Geum is seeing the chairwoman's grandson, Louis.</font>

612
00:44:47,332 --> 00:44:48,902
<font color="yellow">How can I not set you up with girls?</font>

613
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:52,002
<font color="yellow">Let's talk another time. I have to go.</font>

614
00:44:52,662 --> 00:44:53,732
<font color="yellow">Wait, Joong Won!</font>

615
00:44:56,002 --> 00:44:57,802
<font color="yellow">He didn't even listen to me and hung up on me.</font>

616
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:02,232
<font color="yellow">Well, he'll see this if I leave it here.</font>

617
00:45:07,402 --> 00:45:09,732
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? You said you're going to help me.</font>

618
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:11,632
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Yes.</font>

619
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,802
<font color="yellow">She didn't really mean anything,</font>

620
00:45:15,002 --> 00:45:16,332
<font color="yellow">so don't take it seriously.</font>

621
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:17,962
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

622
00:45:22,562 --> 00:45:23,602
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

623
00:45:24,062 --> 00:45:25,302
<font color="yellow">that's a pretty ring.</font>

624
00:45:27,762 --> 00:45:28,962
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

625
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:31,602
<font color="yellow">It looks expensive.</font>

626
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:34,462
<font color="yellow">I guess Louis proposed to you?</font>

627
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:36,762
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

628
00:45:37,732 --> 00:45:41,132
<font color="yellow">He got it because he promised to buy it for me a while ago.</font>

629
00:45:43,362 --> 00:45:44,402
<font color="yellow">Louis, that fellow.</font>

630
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:47,232
<font color="yellow">He fulfills his promises better than I expected.</font>

631
00:45:50,402 --> 00:45:51,462
<font color="yellow">Wear these.</font>

632
00:45:51,602 --> 00:45:54,232
<font color="yellow">It's too pretty to get soaked like that.</font>

633
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:57,232
<font color="yellow">I can take it off briefly. You wear them.</font>

634
00:45:57,362 --> 00:45:59,602
<font color="yellow">Just wear them. That's why I gave them to you.</font>

635
00:46:00,162 --> 00:46:02,462
<font color="yellow">I've been taught to always respect my elders. You wear them.</font>

636
00:46:02,462 --> 00:46:03,602
<font color="yellow">I'll rinse these.</font>

637
00:46:03,602 --> 00:46:04,962
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I'm old?</font>

638
00:46:05,402 --> 00:46:06,662
<font color="yellow">You wear them!</font>

639
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,602
<font color="yellow">You should've just listened to me.</font>

640
00:46:21,402 --> 00:46:23,132
<font color="yellow">Don't come. Don't come.</font>

641
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,032
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

642
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:30,062
<font color="yellow">So the three of us will use the same room, right?</font>

643
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:31,132
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

644
00:46:31,232 --> 00:46:33,662
<font color="yellow">- Mr Kim, do you snore?
- I grind my teeth.</font>

645
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:36,762
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri, you're next!</font>

646
00:46:36,932 --> 00:46:38,862
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri, be careful and walk gently.</font>

647
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,202
<font color="yellow">Is this a minefield? Why are you telling me to walk gently?</font>

648
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,762
<font color="yellow">I'm obviously choosing Number One.</font>

649
00:46:57,302 --> 00:46:59,662
<font color="yellow">What? Will I be sharing the room with Bok Sil?</font>

650
00:47:00,832 --> 00:47:02,832
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep when there's someone else in the room.</font>

651
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:05,502
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Bok Sil sleeps quietly.</font>

652
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:09,862
<font color="yellow">- Oh my goodness.
- It's your turn.</font>

653
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:11,502
<font color="yellow">Mr Louis' hands and feet get cold,</font>

654
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:13,602
<font color="yellow">so he can't sleep in a tent. I'm worried.</font>

655
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:16,232
<font color="yellow">No, don't worry. I'm a lucky guy, you know.</font>

656
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:18,232
<font color="yellow">I've never been unlucky with games like this.</font>

657
00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:23,602
<font color="yellow">I'll choose Number Four.</font>

658
00:47:39,202 --> 00:47:41,902
<font color="yellow">You're a lucky guy, so you won't catch a cold.</font>

659
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:44,732
<font color="yellow">I'm next.</font>

660
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:46,432
<font color="yellow">There's one tent left.</font>

661
00:47:48,862 --> 00:47:49,932
<font color="yellow">I'll choose Number Nine.</font>

662
00:47:50,402 --> 00:47:51,462
<font color="yellow">Good luck!</font>

663
00:47:54,302 --> 00:47:57,302
<font color="yellow">- Ms Kwon, let's chat all night.
- That sounds great.</font>

664
00:47:58,032 --> 00:48:01,232
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha, please come to Room Number Four. Best of luck!</font>

665
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:05,602
<font color="yellow">Then I will...</font>

666
00:48:08,462 --> 00:48:09,462
<font color="yellow">choose Number Two.</font>

667
00:48:10,202 --> 00:48:11,232
<font color="yellow">Here I go.</font>

668
00:48:26,232 --> 00:48:29,062
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha, nothing is going your way today.</font>

669
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:33,502
<font color="yellow">That means Do Jin and I will be using the same room, right?</font>

670
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:36,302
<font color="yellow">This is not right.</font>

671
00:48:36,562 --> 00:48:37,632
<font color="yellow">Let's do it again!</font>

672
00:48:40,632 --> 00:48:42,902
<font color="yellow">- Oh, boy.
- Do you actually grind your teeth?</font>

673
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:46,462
<font color="yellow">Gosh, stop it. You're just going to end up looking pathetic.</font>

674
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:55,362
<font color="yellow">Who drew this? This ladder isn't drawn properly.</font>

675
00:48:55,362 --> 00:48:57,302
<font color="yellow">Let's do it again. We must do it again!</font>

676
00:49:00,432 --> 00:49:01,462
<font color="yellow">Enough.</font>

677
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:02,732
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

678
00:49:03,032 --> 00:49:04,062
<font color="yellow">We have to do it again.</font>

679
00:49:05,632 --> 00:49:06,702
<font color="yellow">We must do it again.</font>

680
00:49:11,662 --> 00:49:12,832
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

681
00:49:13,562 --> 00:49:16,432
<font color="yellow">What's with us? Why are we stuck together from the start to the end?</font>

682
00:49:20,162 --> 00:49:21,232
<font color="yellow">This is what we are.</font>

683
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:24,832
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You irk me, you leech.</font>

684
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:27,802
<font color="yellow">Don't cling to me so that I can hate you all I want.</font>

685
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:31,062
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

686
00:49:31,662 --> 00:49:32,902
<font color="yellow">Dear me.</font>

687
00:49:35,362 --> 00:49:36,602
<font color="yellow">This feels nice.</font>

688
00:49:39,802 --> 00:49:41,402
<font color="yellow">I've never slept in a tent before.</font>

689
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:44,902
<font color="yellow">If things were like before, Mr Kim wouldn't have let me sleep here.</font>

690
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:47,232
<font color="yellow">I'm not surprised.</font>

691
00:49:54,432 --> 00:49:56,702
<font color="yellow">It's cold. I'm cold.</font>

692
00:49:57,832 --> 00:49:59,232
<font color="yellow">I feel colder!</font>

693
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:04,502
<font color="yellow">I have to sleep in an unfamiliar environment...</font>

694
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,662
<font color="yellow">with someone glued to my back.</font>

695
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:09,832

<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

702
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:40,802
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, can't you fall asleep because you miss me?</font>

703
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:42,462
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

718
00:52:26,232 --> 00:52:29,732

00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:36,562
<font color="yellow">I'm going outside for a minute.</font>

722

<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

723
00:52:39,832 --> 00:52:41,032

725
00:52:45,932 --> 00:52:48,362

726

<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's right.</font>

727
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:10,102

- What?</font>

730
00:53:20,002 --> 00:53:21,932

- Just wear it.</font>

731
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,662
