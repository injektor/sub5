<font color="yellow">See you in Seoul.</font>

317
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:05,027
<font color="yellow">And send Bok Sil to Haeundae Station.</font>

318
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:31,527
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

319
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:33,927
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

320
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:44,397
<font color="yellow">In Sung will lead the mission.</font>

321
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:46,557
<font color="yellow">Louis met Bok Sil.</font>

322
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:49,097
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

323
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:51,557
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, wait me at the dock in Dongbaek Island with Mr Louis.</font>

324
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:53,327
<font color="yellow">Keep him close to you, okay?</font>

325
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:57,027
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim will lead Bok Sil to the dock.</font>

326
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:13,227
<font color="yellow">- Mr Louis! - Mr Kim, we're over here.</font>

327
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:15,397
<font color="yellow">Stay right there, Mr Louis!</font>

328
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:17,457
<font color="yellow">When Mr Kim chases after me,</font>

329
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:18,727
<font color="yellow">I'll run to the yacht.</font>

330
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:21,697
<font color="yellow">Stay here, okay?</font>

331
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:24,427
<font color="yellow">Ms Heo will be in charge of Bok Nam.</font>

332
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:27,497
<font color="yellow">Sir, after the woman comes in,</font>

333
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,727
<font color="yellow">start the yacht as soon as the man leaves.</font>

334
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,857
<font color="yellow">Even if she asks you to stop, you must keep going.</font>

335
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:33,497
<font color="yellow">Go out to the sea.</font>

336
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,027
<font color="yellow">Give the order to the yacht captain.</font>

337
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:39,097
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, where are you now?</font>

338
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:41,627
<font color="yellow">Do you see another yacht around you?</font>

339
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:44,597
<font color="yellow">Detective will call Bok Sil and tell her about Bok Nam.</font>

340
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,527
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam is there, too.</font>

341
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:49,097
<font color="yellow">Make it as urgent as possible.</font>

342
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:51,857
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam, over here!</font>

343
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:53,557
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam.</font>

344
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:57,097
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam will appear when Bok Sil calls your name.</font>

345
00:28:57,227 --> 00:28:58,327
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

346
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,957
<font color="yellow">- Is everyone okay? - Okay.</font>

347
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:06,597
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - I don't agree with this plan.</font>

348
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:09,657
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Bok Sil will be very surprised.</font>

349
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:12,157
<font color="yellow">If you appear as a pauper when you should be in France,</font>

350
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:13,957
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil will be in such a shock.</font>

351
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:15,897
<font color="yellow">That's why this is a surprise.</font>

352
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:17,297
<font color="yellow">It's to surprise her.</font>

353
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:20,197
<font color="yellow">When she's surprised to see Louis,</font>

354
00:29:20,197 --> 00:29:21,757
<font color="yellow">we'll surprise her again with Bok Nam.</font>

355
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:25,397
<font color="yellow">It's a great setup to surprise her with Bok Nam.</font>

356
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,927
<font color="yellow">- I don't agree, either. - Why not?</font>

357
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:32,197
<font color="yellow">Is it necessary...</font>

358
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,497
<font color="yellow">for you to pretend to be penniless?</font>

359
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:36,597
<font color="yellow">You're too precious to do that.</font>

360
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:40,357
<font color="yellow">I was actually penniless when I first met Bok Sil.</font>

361
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:42,327
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil saved me even though I was poor.</font>

362
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:44,757
<font color="yellow">By reenacting the day we first met,</font>

363
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:47,457
<font color="yellow">I want her to remember how we met.</font>

364
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:49,497
<font color="yellow">I'll use Bok Nam to prove that...</font>

365
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,957
<font color="yellow">it was a blessing that Bok Sil and I met.</font>

366
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,597
<font color="yellow">Mr Louis is so romantic.</font>

367
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,497
<font color="yellow">He wants to plan...</font>

368
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:04,027
<font color="yellow">a surprising event for Bok Sil.</font>

369
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:07,227
<font color="yellow">I'm so touched.</font>

370
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:12,127
<font color="yellow">Anyway, please help me.</font>

371
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,227
<font color="yellow">All of you. Please.</font>

372
00:30:16,627 --> 00:30:18,397
<font color="yellow">- Okay? - Okay!</font>

373
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:19,857
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

374
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:22,397
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay?</font>

375
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:25,527
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

376
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:31,127
<font color="yellow">Let's start. Ready, action!</font>

377
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:35,557
<font color="yellow">Why did you take a picture?</font>

378
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:37,527
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

379
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:40,127
<font color="yellow">I'll do it again. It's a video now.</font>

380
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:43,127
<font color="yellow">Ready, action!</font>

381
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:46,897
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Are you surprised?</font>

382
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:50,657
<font color="yellow">I promised you I'll find Bok Nam, didn't I?</font>

383
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:52,357
<font color="yellow">I kept my word.</font>

384
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:54,897
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good.</font>

385
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,857
<font color="yellow">Why did you stop? I wasn't done.</font>

386
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,757
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

387
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:02,197
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll start over.</font>

388
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,197
<font color="yellow">In Sung, get it right this time.</font>

389
00:31:05,457 --> 00:31:06,897
<font color="yellow">- Shall I start? - Yes.</font>

390
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:11,427
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Are you surprised?</font>

391
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,027
<font color="yellow">I promised you I'll find Bok Nam, didn't I?</font>

392
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:16,597
<font color="yellow">I kept my word.</font>

393
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:19,027
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much trouble I went through?</font>

394
00:31:19,197 --> 00:31:21,657
<font color="yellow">I had to run around for hours.</font>

395
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:24,597
<font color="yellow">You said Bok Nam was Slow Toad,</font>

396
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:27,157
<font color="yellow">but he was so quick. He kept jumping around.</font>

397
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,427
<font color="yellow">I even climbed 168 stairs.</font>

398
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,227
<font color="yellow">As many as 168 stairs.</font>

399
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:35,297
<font color="yellow">Also, I had to wear this thin jacket for today's event.</font>

400
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:38,657
<font color="yellow">I wore more clothes inside.</font>

401
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:46,227
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

402
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,597
<font color="yellow">The day I first met you was...</font>

403
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:56,057
<font color="yellow">the luckiest day of my life.</font>

404
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:02,797
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

405
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,197
<font color="yellow">for meeting me again today.</font>

406
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:39,897
<font color="yellow">(Congratulations! We have found Bok Nam.)</font>

407
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:08,097
<font color="yellow">The day I first met you was...</font>

408
00:33:10,227 --> 00:33:12,427
<font color="yellow">the luckiest day of my life.</font>

409
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:38,897
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

410
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,057
<font color="yellow">for meeting me again today.</font>

411
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:31,597
<font color="yellow">I promised you I'd find Bok Nam.</font>

412
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:34,157
<font color="yellow">I told you to trust me.</font>

413
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:38,097
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Louis.</font>

414
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:50,157
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Give them a big hand.</font>

415
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,327
<font color="yellow">It must be there. She lives on such high ground.</font>

416
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:11,227
<font color="yellow">- Can we really visit her like this? - Do you think I'm that rude?</font>

417
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:13,227
<font color="yellow">I already got Bok Sil's permission.</font>

418
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:15,327
<font color="yellow">She told me the password as well.</font>

419
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,527
<font color="yellow">You're so tenacious.</font>

420
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:20,227
<font color="yellow">What? What's wrong with that?</font>

421
00:35:20,657 --> 00:35:21,857
<font color="yellow">I'm the one...</font>

422
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:24,897
<font color="yellow">who made you a postmaster when you had no ambition.</font>

423
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,597
<font color="yellow">Well... That's true.</font>

424
00:35:27,197 --> 00:35:29,897
<font color="yellow">I can easily turn Bok Sil into an oriental doctor.</font>

425
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:32,127
<font color="yellow">She's an extraordinary girl.</font>

426
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:35,027
<font color="yellow">If we support her well, she'll be very successful.</font>

427
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:54,197
<font color="yellow">So this is where she lives.</font>

428
00:35:54,697 --> 00:35:57,657
<font color="yellow">- Put them in the fridge. - Oh, yes. I will.</font>

429
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,997
<font color="yellow">Freeze.</font>

430
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:09,397
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

431
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:10,997
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

432
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:13,857
<font color="yellow">come into an empty house and open up the fridge?</font>

433
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:16,527
<font color="yellow">What about you? Who are you?</font>

434
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:19,657
<font color="yellow">How do you know Bok Sil?</font>

435
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:23,227
<font color="yellow">Do you know Bok Sil?</font>

436
00:36:26,757 --> 00:36:29,227
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm...</font>

437
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:33,357
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil's mother.</font>

438
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:38,527
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil said she doesn't have parents.</font>

439
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:42,357
<font color="yellow">I'm her neighbour and her security manager.</font>

440
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:44,997
<font color="yellow">I'm like her step-mother.</font>

441
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:48,397
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

442
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:51,657
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

443
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:55,357
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil's future mother-in-law.</font>

444
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:01,227
<font color="yellow">Mother-in-law?</font>

445
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:07,227
<font color="yellow">But Louis said he only has a grandmother and no parents.</font>

446
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,827
<font color="yellow">Who is Louis?</font>

447
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:12,957
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Louis' mother?</font>

448
00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:15,597
<font color="yellow">I'm Cha Joong Won's mother.</font>

449
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,157
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

450
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:21,327
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What is happening?</font>

451
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:23,097
<font color="yellow">By Louis, do you mean...</font>

452
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:27,157
<font color="yellow">- the successor of Gold Group? - Yes.</font>

453
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:29,567
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

454
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:34,227
<font color="yellow">he and Bok Sil are going out or something?</font>

455
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:35,997
<font color="yellow">It's more than that.</font>

456
00:37:35,997 --> 00:37:37,857
<font color="yellow">They used to live here together.</font>

457
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:39,227
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

458
00:37:49,757 --> 00:37:51,397
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he coming?</font>

459
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:55,727
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri.</font>

460
00:37:55,897 --> 00:37:58,357
<font color="yellow">Date someone who likes you.</font>

461
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,027
<font color="yellow">Both Mr Cha and Louis aren't interested in you.</font>

462
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,157
<font color="yellow">Don't waste your time on them.</font>

463
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:06,027
<font color="yellow">Mum. Are you really my mum?</font>

464
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:08,097
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you taking my side?</font>

465
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:11,357
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried that you might get hurt later.</font>

466
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:16,657
<font color="yellow">I can set you up on a blind date. Are you interested?</font>

467
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:19,497
<font color="yellow">He's my friend's son.</font>

468
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:21,127
<font color="yellow">He's a great guy.</font>

469
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:25,897
<font color="yellow">You know how much I care about beauty, right?</font>

470
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:36,027
<font color="yellow">Are you Ms Baek Ma Ri?</font>

471
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:39,897
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

472
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:48,927
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

473
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,297
<font color="yellow">I said I already have someone I like.</font>

474
00:38:52,757 --> 00:38:54,927
<font color="yellow">She moved from Yokji Island to Busan.</font>

475
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:57,757
<font color="yellow">I can't live without her.</font>

476
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,857
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here then?</font>

477
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:13,657
<font color="yellow">If you had said it sooner, I wouldn't have come here.</font>

478
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:17,497
<font color="yellow">I came all the way from Seoul.</font>

479
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:19,297
<font color="yellow">How dare you make a fool of me?</font>

480
00:39:20,797 --> 00:39:22,957
<font color="yellow">He is my mum's friend's son.</font>

481
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:24,197
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't.</font>

482
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:26,297
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't throw it.</font>

483
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,827
<font color="yellow">I'm Baek Ma Ri, the Mother Teresa of Goldline.</font>

484
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,067
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

485
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:56,597
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go back to Seoul with Bok Sil and her brother.</font>

486
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:58,927
<font color="yellow">I haven't been in Busan for a long time.</font>

487
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:01,627
<font color="yellow">This city is not letting me go.</font>

488
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:06,157
<font color="yellow">Look at you. You're all worried about me.</font>

489
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:07,327
<font color="yellow">You've grown up, Louis.</font>

490
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:09,927
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll talk to you later.</font>

491
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:16,497
<font color="yellow">Oh, isn't that Ma Ri? It's her.</font>

492
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:17,857
<font color="yellow">What brings her to Busan?</font>

493
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:21,497
<font color="yellow">- Ma Ri. - My goodness!</font>

494
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:26,927
<font color="yellow">Did something happen? Why are you crying?</font>

495
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:28,827
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

496
00:40:29,957 --> 00:40:31,857
<font color="yellow">- Ma Ri. - Gosh, go away!</font>

497
00:40:34,627 --> 00:40:36,957
<font color="yellow">Don't come near me.</font>

498
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:38,327
<font color="yellow">Okay. That time, I...</font>

499
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:40,357
<font color="yellow">- No! Don't say anything. - All right. Goodness.</font>

500
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,067
<font color="yellow">Did I scare you?</font>

501
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:45,527
<font color="yellow">You're disgusted with me, aren't you?</font>

502
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:47,857
<font color="yellow">Wait up.</font>

503
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:51,497
<font color="yellow">- Ma Ri. - Why do you keep following me?</font>

504
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:52,567
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

505
00:40:53,597 --> 00:40:55,697
<font color="yellow">If you're depressed,</font>

506
00:40:57,297 --> 00:40:58,427
<font color="yellow">you should eat ulmyeon.</font>

507
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:00,927
<font color="yellow">And eat jjajangmyeon when you're annoyed.</font>

508
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:06,397
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go watch a movie with me?</font>

509
00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:08,357
<font color="yellow">I know of a good place.</font>

510
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:11,997
<font color="yellow">It's over there. You see that mountain, right?</font>

511
00:41:13,357 --> 00:41:14,357
<font color="yellow">It's very pretty.</font>

512
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:17,357
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come? Follow me.</font>

513
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,227
<font color="yellow">What's he saying?</font>

514
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:34,127
<font color="yellow">Hey! Let Bok Nam sit beside Bok Sil.</font>

515
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:36,357
<font color="yellow">Why should I? I haven't seen her for a long time, either.</font>

516
00:41:36,357 --> 00:41:39,227
<font color="yellow">- Bok Nam could have died. - Me, too.</font>

517
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:40,797
<font color="yellow">Shut it. This is my car.</font>

518
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:44,227
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

519
00:41:45,627 --> 00:41:46,627
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

520
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,627
<font color="yellow">Am I your driver or what?</font>

521
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:56,827
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is so pathetic.</font>

522
00:41:57,627 --> 00:41:58,757
<font color="yellow">Everyone, put your seat belts on!</font>

523
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:05,857
<font color="yellow">My driver, let's go.</font>

524
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,427
<font color="yellow">Hey! How dare you call me that?</font>

525
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,027
<font color="yellow">Go, go, go!</font>

526
00:42:18,227 --> 00:42:21,457
<font color="yellow">The shape of the lighthouse resembles that of a baby bottle.</font>

527
00:42:21,927 --> 00:42:23,357
<font color="yellow">Bingo.</font>

528
00:42:23,827 --> 00:42:25,327
<font color="yellow">People call it Baby Bottle Lighthouse.</font>

529
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,897
<font color="yellow">My random guess was correct.</font>

530
00:42:28,327 --> 00:42:31,627
<font color="yellow">I heard that women conceive babies after visiting this lighthouse.</font>

531
00:42:32,957 --> 00:42:33,957
<font color="yellow">Baby?</font>

532
00:42:34,757 --> 00:42:37,697
<font color="yellow">Jung Ran, you should have a baby before you get older.</font>

533
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:42,127
<font color="yellow">Ho Joon.</font>

534
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:44,157
<font color="yellow">Let me remind you.</font>

535
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:47,997
<font color="yellow">We're not married, and you haven't even proposed to me yet.</font>

536
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:49,067
<font color="yellow">And what? A baby?</font>

537
00:42:50,427 --> 00:42:52,627
<font color="yellow">Go through the proper steps!</font>

538
00:42:53,297 --> 00:42:54,627
<font color="yellow">You see how well Mr Louis treats Bok Sil.</font>

539
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:58,327
<font color="yellow">He planned that touching event for her.</font>

540
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,297
<font color="yellow">You should learn from him!</font>

541
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:02,657
<font color="yellow">Jung Ran.</font>

542
00:43:02,657 --> 00:43:05,127
<font color="yellow">Jung Ran. I was just worried about you giving birth at an old age.</font>

543
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:08,227
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and mind your own business!</font>

544
00:43:09,857 --> 00:43:10,927
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me.</font>

545
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:13,027
<font color="yellow">- Jung Ran... - I said, don't follow me!</font>

546
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:15,797
<font color="yellow">Jung Ran, let me explain. Jung Ran.</font>

547
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,157
<font color="yellow">Are we there yet?</font>

548
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:23,067
<font color="yellow">I must have been crazy.</font>

549
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:26,027
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have followed him.</font>

550
00:43:26,657 --> 00:43:28,527
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my feet hurt.</font>

551
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:34,757
<font color="yellow">- Here. - What are you doing?</font>

552
00:43:35,227 --> 00:43:38,297
<font color="yellow">Wear them. You said your feet are hurting.</font>

553
00:43:39,227 --> 00:43:40,327
<font color="yellow">I cannot wear them.</font>

554
00:43:40,857 --> 00:43:43,857
<font color="yellow">Do you actually think these shoes go with my elegant outfit?</font>

555
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:45,827
<font color="yellow">I know that they don't,</font>

556
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:48,527
<font color="yellow">but you're in pain. I'll make it work. Just a second.</font>

557
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,997
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Oh, no. What are you doing right now?</font>

558
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,527
<font color="yellow">Gosh, wait for a second.</font>

559
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:57,027
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh. My goodness.</font>

560
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,697
<font color="yellow">My gosh, look. Hey, stop it. Goodness.</font>

561
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:02,557
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness. Hey!</font>

562
00:44:03,627 --> 00:44:05,627
<font color="yellow">Why are you running away with my shoes?</font>

563
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:08,797
<font color="yellow">You told me to stay far away from you. We're almost there. Follow me.</font>

564
00:44:14,997 --> 00:44:16,527
<font color="yellow">His feet will be cold.</font>

565
00:44:17,127 --> 00:44:18,757
<font color="yellow">Is he pretending to be kind or what?</font>

566
00:44:19,397 --> 00:44:22,127
<font color="yellow">Gosh, just the sight of him annoys me so much.</font>

567
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:25,627
<font color="yellow">Goodness, what is this?</font>

568
00:44:27,757 --> 00:44:28,827
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous.</font>

569
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,227
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3.</font>

570
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:33,827
<font color="yellow">- The movie is starting now. - Let's go.</font>

571
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:38,927
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it so nice here? - I told you not to come near me.</font>

572
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,027
<font color="yellow">Right, I was about to walk away.</font>

573
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:46,957
<font color="yellow">That day,</font>

574
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:51,427
<font color="yellow">I know you had a tough day because of me.</font>

575
00:44:53,627 --> 00:44:55,327
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do now? I have to go!</font>

576
00:44:55,357 --> 00:44:57,397
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

577
00:44:57,657 --> 00:44:59,957
<font color="yellow">If we can't pull over,</font>

578
00:44:59,957 --> 00:45:02,727
<font color="yellow">I might end up doing something I'll regret so much later.</font>

579
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:06,297
<font color="yellow">Hold it, okay? You have to hold it at all costs!</font>

580
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:09,197
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my stomach! My goodness!</font>

581
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:12,227
<font color="yellow">- Goodness gracious! - Oh, my goodness!</font>

582
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:29,157
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

583
00:45:36,627 --> 00:45:38,327
<font color="yellow">- I was... - Shut it.</font>

584
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:42,057
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare bring it up. I don't even want to think about it.</font>

585
00:45:45,997 --> 00:45:47,827
<font color="yellow">I heard you don't drive that car any more because of me.</font>

586
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:49,397
<font color="yellow">- Shut your mouth! - Okay.</font>

587
00:45:54,597 --> 00:45:57,657
<font color="yellow">- But if you need... - Gosh, seriously!</font>

588
00:46:02,997 --> 00:46:05,457
<font color="yellow">- I can take the car and... - What do you want from me?</font>

589
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:07,327
<font color="yellow">Let's go watch the movie.</font>

590
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:51,457
<font color="yellow">Is she cold?</font>

591
00:47:01,597 --> 00:47:02,657
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

592
00:47:15,027 --> 00:47:16,557
<font color="yellow">Shall I just let it out?</font>

593
00:47:23,397 --> 00:47:24,427
<font color="yellow">Is she thirsty?</font>

594
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:29,097
<font color="yellow">- Ma Ri, I got this for you. - I said, go away.</font>

595
00:47:29,127 --> 00:47:30,957
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't come near you.</font>

596
00:47:31,897 --> 00:47:32,957
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

597
00:47:58,897 --> 00:48:00,027
<font color="yellow">I should just leave.</font>

598
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:18,697
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, what is this smell? - It stinks.</font>

599
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:20,827
<font color="yellow">It was me.</font>

600
00:48:22,157 --> 00:48:23,397
<font color="yellow">Judging from the sound,</font>

601
00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:26,197
<font color="yellow">I'm convinced that it was my fart!</font>

602
00:48:26,197 --> 00:48:27,227
<font color="yellow">(I'm convinced that it was my fart!)</font>

603
00:48:30,297 --> 00:48:31,927
<font color="yellow">It smells like he ate a ton of kimchi.</font>

604
00:48:35,197 --> 00:48:37,757
<font color="yellow">You got it wrong! I ate meat.</font>

605
00:48:40,157 --> 00:48:43,127
<font color="yellow">- We want to focus on the movie. - Yes, I'm sorry.</font>

606
00:48:43,227 --> 00:48:44,897
<font color="yellow">- Please sit down. - Okay.</font>

607
00:48:45,097 --> 00:48:46,627
<font color="yellow">I also did number two in a car a month ago.</font>

608
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:52,397
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I apologise.</font>

609
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,627
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - We want to watch the movie.</font>

610
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:55,697
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

611
00:48:57,097 --> 00:48:58,427
<font color="yellow">Didn't it sound like a blast of a ship horn?</font>

612
00:49:01,457 --> 00:49:02,657
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so hilarious.</font>

613
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,397
<font color="yellow">Here. Eat slowly. There's a lot of food.</font>

614
00:49:15,057 --> 00:49:16,797
<font color="yellow">- He's not a ghost, right? - No.</font>

615
00:49:22,557 --> 00:49:23,597
<font color="yellow">He's not a ghost, indeed.</font>

616
00:49:25,027 --> 00:49:27,757
<font color="yellow">We thought you were dead. You better be good to your sister.</font>

617
00:49:27,927 --> 00:49:30,157
<font color="yellow">She went through so much because of you.</font>

618
00:49:30,157 --> 00:49:31,697
<font color="yellow">- Do you understand? - Yes.</font>

619
00:49:32,697 --> 00:49:35,127
<font color="yellow">I went through a lot, too. Do you get what I'm saying?</font>

620
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:36,657
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

621
00:49:39,597 --> 00:49:42,557
<font color="yellow">Two guys in your life were thought to be dead.</font>

622
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:46,097
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I must say, your life is so dynamic.</font>

623
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:47,927
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

624
00:49:50,227 --> 00:49:51,997
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly. Chew well.</font>

625
00:49:52,597 --> 00:49:53,597
<font color="yellow">Drink some water.</font>

626
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:55,127
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so full.</font>

627
00:49:58,227 --> 00:50:01,397
<font color="yellow">- Go home. - Why? I want to sleep here.</font>

628
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:05,227
<font color="yellow">This room is way too small for the three of you.</font>

629
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:07,897
<font color="yellow">The four of us slept in your room last time.</font>

630
00:50:07,897 --> 00:50:10,627
<font color="yellow">I only let you guys stay with us because you had nowhere to go.</font>

631
00:50:10,627 --> 00:50:12,297
<font color="yellow">You live in a fancy mansion now.</font>

632
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,557
<font color="yellow">Why would you sleep in this tiny room?</font>

633
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:15,997
<font color="yellow">Because Bok Sil is here.</font>

634
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,457
<font color="yellow">- Yes, just sleep here. - I will.</font>

635
00:50:19,497 --> 00:50:21,827
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Let's go now.</font>

636
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:24,857
<font color="yellow">They haven't seen each other for so long, so they should catch up.</font>

637
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:26,327
<font color="yellow">You're so slow.</font>

638
00:50:26,897 --> 00:50:28,357
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

639
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:31,957
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

640
00:50:32,727 --> 00:50:34,957
<font color="yellow">I'll let Bok Nam take my place today.</font>

641
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:37,297
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

642
00:50:41,027 --> 00:50:42,827
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight, my sister-in-law. - You, too.</font>

643
00:50:44,657 --> 00:50:46,327
<font color="yellow">Do you mean brother-in-law?</font>

644
00:50:46,427 --> 00:50:48,697
<font color="yellow">The two of you have a lot to learn.</font>

645
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:50,557
<font color="yellow">You two are like two peas in a pod.</font>

646
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:52,327
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams.</font>

647
00:50:54,357 --> 00:50:56,157
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight. - You, too.</font>

648
00:50:56,397 --> 00:50:58,597
<font color="yellow">- You can sleep beside In Sung. - Gosh. No, thanks.</font>

649
00:51:00,227 --> 00:51:01,427
<font color="yellow">All right. Goodnight, guys.</font>

650
00:51:01,427 --> 00:51:02,827
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight. - Goodnight.</font>

651
00:51:06,057 --> 00:51:07,997
<font color="yellow">You must be tired. Let's go to bed.</font>

652
00:51:08,997 --> 00:51:10,057
<font color="yellow">I'll do it for you.</font>

653
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:14,557
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam.</font>

654
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:18,397
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

655
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:20,427
<font color="yellow">that Grandma passed away?</font>

656
00:51:23,557 --> 00:51:24,557
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

657
00:51:25,157 --> 00:51:26,157
<font color="yellow">I heard.</font>

658
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:31,697
<font color="yellow">She was very worried about you.</font>

659
00:51:33,297 --> 00:51:35,927
<font color="yellow">Before I left for Seoul, I promised her...</font>

660
00:51:36,897 --> 00:51:38,297
<font color="yellow">that I'd be sure to find you...</font>

661
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:40,597
<font color="yellow">and cook a warm meal for you.</font>

662
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:43,757
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

663
00:51:45,427 --> 00:51:48,897
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Bok Nam and rest in peace.</font>

664
00:51:50,697 --> 00:51:52,427
<font color="yellow">I'll be sure to find him.</font>

665
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:54,997
<font color="yellow">I'll fix a warm meal for him and take care of him.</font>

666
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:57,597
<font color="yellow">Grandma, so...</font>

667
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:00,457
<font color="yellow">don't worry about us...</font>

668
00:52:02,057 --> 00:52:03,827
<font color="yellow">and just rest in peace.</font>

669
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:42,527
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

670
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:44,597
<font color="yellow">I kept my promise.</font>

671
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:47,357
<font color="yellow">You don't need to worry about us any more.</font>

672
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:57,297
<font color="yellow">The man I know,</font>

673
00:52:57,897 --> 00:53:00,457
<font color="yellow">King of Shopping, Louis, seemed naive,</font>

674
00:53:00,757 --> 00:53:02,457
<font color="yellow">gullible and inept.</font>

675
00:53:03,157 --> 00:53:06,427
<font color="yellow">However, he was a man with a non-judgmental heart.</font>

676
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:10,797
<font color="yellow">His boundless sincerity...</font>

677
00:53:11,797 --> 00:53:14,657
<font color="yellow">transformed her sadness into happiness...</font>

678
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:16,857
<font color="yellow">and made a miracle happen.</font>

679
00:53:44,227 --> 00:53:45,557
<font color="yellow">Yes, Nam Joon Hyuk speaking.</font>

680
00:53:48,657 --> 00:53:50,427
<font color="yellow">The suspect of the Eunsung-dong case woke up?</font>

681
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,797
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be right there.</font>

682
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,027
<font color="yellow">- Hey, let's go to the hospital. - Okay.</font>

683
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:07,297
<font color="yellow">The suspect of the Eunsung-dong case regained his consciousness.</font>

684
00:54:09,327 --> 00:54:11,757
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that right?</font>

685
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:13,957
<font color="yellow">We're on our way to the hospital now.</font>

686
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:17,597
<font color="yellow">I'll call you as soon as we confirm his identity.</font>

687
00:54:18,397 --> 00:54:20,797
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

688
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:25,657
<font color="yellow">What if Mr Goo...</font>

689
00:54:26,457 --> 00:54:28,027
<font color="yellow">tells them about me?</font>

690
00:54:41,857 --> 00:54:42,897
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

691
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:55,597
<font color="yellow">It's me, Sir. The suspect is gone.</font>

692
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:58,227
<font color="yellow">You two officers!</font>

693
00:55:01,427 --> 00:55:03,097
<font color="yellow">Were you two slacking off or what?</font>

694
00:55:03,657 --> 00:55:05,557
<font color="yellow">Search the area. Move!</font>

695
00:55:13,927 --> 00:55:16,627
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek. We're at the hospital now,</font>

696
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:18,857
<font color="yellow">but the suspect is gone.</font>

697
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:20,327
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

698
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:25,227
<font color="yellow">I wanted to know who he is.</font>

699
00:55:25,957 --> 00:55:28,697
<font color="yellow">Okay. Please let me know if you find him.</font>

700
00:55:45,157 --> 00:55:46,227
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

701
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:48,027
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

702
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:50,327
<font color="yellow">May I ask who is calling?</font>

703
00:55:51,597 --> 00:55:54,157
<font color="yellow">I see. You work with my husband.</font>

704
00:55:54,157 --> 00:55:55,627
<font color="yellow">Mr Goo?</font>

705
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:59,097
<font color="yellow">Please visit us sometime. I'd love to invite you over for a meal...</font>

706
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:01,227
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you?</font>

707
00:56:01,297 --> 00:56:03,697
<font color="yellow">Get out now. Leave!</font>

708
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:06,357
<font color="yellow">Honey, he'll hear you. Do you have to be that rude to me?</font>

709
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,157
<font color="yellow">Get out, please!</font>

710
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:11,297
<font color="yellow">Why do you get angry at me all the time?</font>

711
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:18,997
<font color="yellow">Mr Goo?</font>

712
00:56:19,557 --> 00:56:20,597
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

713
00:56:21,197 --> 00:56:24,027
<font color="yellow">Let's meet now. Let's talk in person.</font>

714
00:56:26,457 --> 00:56:28,397
<font color="yellow">I haven't talked to you in so long, Mr Baek.</font>

715
00:56:29,297 --> 00:56:30,697
<font color="yellow">So Kang Ji Sung...</font>

716
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,657
<font color="yellow">went back to Gold Group while I was unconscious.</font>

717
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:37,497
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

718
00:56:38,057 --> 00:56:40,727
<font color="yellow">trying to threaten me now?</font>

719
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:43,227
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what are you talking about?</font>

720
00:56:44,027 --> 00:56:46,157
<font color="yellow">It's not like I went to see Ms Choi.</font>

721
00:56:47,727 --> 00:56:49,997
<font color="yellow">If you're going to keep that defensive attitude of yours,</font>

722
00:56:51,757 --> 00:56:54,227
<font color="yellow">I don't know how I'll change.</font>

723
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:57,797
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

724
00:56:58,597 --> 00:57:00,157
<font color="yellow">How much do you want?</font>

725
00:57:00,757 --> 00:57:02,357
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

726
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:06,597
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hello?</font>

727
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:14,397
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

728
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:29,797
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

729
00:57:57,597 --> 00:58:00,057
<font color="yellow">(Shopaholic Louis)</font>

730
00:58:00,157 --> 00:58:01,197
<font color="yellow">Mr Goo?</font>

731
00:58:01,197 --> 00:58:03,097
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek's voice is recorded here.</font>

732
00:58:03,097 --> 00:58:04,797
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie to me?</font>

733
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,057
<font color="yellow">What do you want from me?</font>

734
00:58:06,057 --> 00:58:08,757
<font color="yellow">I like Bok Sil. It's too bad.</font>

735
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:10,997
<font color="yellow">Don't look at me like that. You're making me feel vulnerable.</font>

736
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,697
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

737
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,727
<font color="yellow">Is Bok Sil the only thing on Louis' mind?</font>

738
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,297
<font color="yellow">I thought you looked familiar when I first met you.</font>

739
00:58:17,297 --> 00:58:19,057
<font color="yellow">Have we met before?</font>

740
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:22,227
<font color="yellow">- What happened to his treasure box? - It's gone.</font>

741
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:23,927
<font color="yellow">Disappear, so that no one can find you.</font>

742
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:26,727
<font color="yellow">I'm mapping out a big plan at the moment.</font>
