00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,640
<font color="yellow">I have an idea. I'll get you the best tutor.</font>

464
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,570
<font color="yellow">He's been a tutor since I was young. He's amazing.</font>

465
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,210
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- It's not okay.</font>

466
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,910
<font color="yellow">I told you to trust me.</font>

467
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,510
<font color="yellow">Even though you got your memory back,</font>

468
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,770
<font color="yellow">you still tell people to trust you.</font>

469
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,240
<font color="yellow">Did you get back Bok Sil's money that was stolen?</font>

470
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,270
<font color="yellow">- You told her to trust you.
- I'll get it back for her, okay?</font>

471
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,970
<font color="yellow">Why are you nagging me?</font>

472
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,770
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk to me like that?</font>

473
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,870
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

474
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,410
<font color="yellow">- Come here.
- Wait a minute.</font>

475

476

<font color="yellow">Hey, do me a favour.</font>

505
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,640

506
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,810
<font color="yellow">Boss. It's that way.</font>

507

<font color="yellow">It's 30 dollars per 20kg.</font>

00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,710

00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,710

539
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,710

541
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,410

00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,510
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil became a president of a company.</font>

557
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,010
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Search for Singsingline.</font>

558
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,840
<font color="yellow">Singsingline.</font>

559
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,010
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil is the president.</font>

560
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,710
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. It's a website for direct dealing of farm products.</font>

561
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,340
<font color="yellow">They distribute farm products named after the grower.</font>

562
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,940
<font color="yellow">When did she found this company?</font>

563
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,910
<font color="yellow">Do you know what the bigger news is?</font>

564
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,110
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- The director of her company...</font>

565
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,810
<font color="yellow">is Mr Cha.</font>

566
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,110
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What?</font>

567
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,740
<font color="yellow">That can't be true.</font>

568
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,710
<font color="yellow">Why did he quit our company and start working there?</font>

569
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,110
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee. What do you think?</font>

570
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,540
<font color="yellow">Why else?</font>

571
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,940
<font color="yellow">He must've followed Bok Sil.</font>

572
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,510
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Please stop talking nonsense...</font>

573
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,640
<font color="yellow">and go back to work.</font>

574
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,040
<font color="yellow">Looking at the question won't give you an answer.</font>

575
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,740
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

576
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,840
<font color="yellow">I think you should start from factorisation.</font>

577
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,340
<font color="yellow">You know what factorisation is, right?</font>

578
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,040
<font color="yellow">I've heard of it.</font>

579
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,210
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

580
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,110
<font color="yellow">You've heard of it at least.</font>

581
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,040
<font color="yellow">I'll get a new textbook tomorrow.</font>

582
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,040
<font color="yellow">That's all for today.</font>

583
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

584
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,510
<font color="yellow">I thought Bok Sil looked familiar when I first met her.</font>

585
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,910
<font color="yellow">But your face looks even more familiar.</font>

586
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,810
<font color="yellow">Have we met before?</font>

587
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,040
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

588
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,470
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

589
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,610
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I saw him somewhere.</font>

590
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,470
<font color="yellow">These products look good.</font>

591
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,040
<font color="yellow">Is it the right amount?</font>

592
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

593
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,440

<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

595
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,210
<font color="yellow">Hey. Stop coming here.</font>

596
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,810
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep showing up?</font>

597
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,710
<font color="yellow">I'm here for business today.</font>

598
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,540
<font color="yellow">What business?</font>

599
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,840
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat, Ms Ko.</font>

600
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,640
<font color="yellow">You too, Mr Daddy Long Legs.</font>

601
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,670
<font color="yellow">Why don't you...</font>

602
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,740
<font color="yellow">make a contract with Goldline?</font>

603
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,380
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

604
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,210
<font color="yellow">It's not because of you.</font>

605
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,670
<font color="yellow">It's not.</font>

606
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,310
<font color="yellow">I'm suggesting this because Goldline is having a renewal,</font>

607
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,210
<font color="yellow">and we need a company that directly delivers vegetables from the farm.</font>

608
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,240
<font color="yellow">We'll have branch lines, and each line will be managed separately.</font>

609
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,640
<font color="yellow">Also, the merchandiser's notes will be opened to the public.</font>

610
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,710
<font color="yellow">You can keep your company's concept as usual.</font>

611
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,670
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you saying anything?</font>

612
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,340
<font color="yellow">We'll think about it.</font>

613
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Bok Sil.</font>

614
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,810
<font color="yellow">Are you turning down my offer?</font>

615
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,040
<font color="yellow">Singsingline is invested by Mr Cha,</font>

616
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,840
<font color="yellow">and managed by me.</font>

617
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,710
<font color="yellow">We're now settling down and getting popular.</font>

618
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,380
<font color="yellow">It's hard to decide whether working with Goldline is a good idea or not.</font>

619
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,140
<font color="yellow">As an investor, let me ask you a few questions.</font>

620
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,640
<font color="yellow">What are the terms of the contract?</font>

621
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,770
<font color="yellow">You'll have to use Goldline's delivery service.</font>

622
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,940
<font color="yellow">As for the profit, we'll get 20 percent.</font>

623
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,240
<font color="yellow">It's not bad.</font>

624
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,840
<font color="yellow">If we work under Goldline,</font>

625
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,880
<font color="yellow">there will be additional distribution process.</font>

626
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,170
<font color="yellow">That means we'll have to raise the price of the goods.</font>

627
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,970
<font color="yellow">But if your products are promoted on Goldline's website,</font>

628
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,470
<font color="yellow">the suppliers may earn bigger profits.</font>

629
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,840
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

630
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,240
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

631
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,910
<font color="yellow">Louis' offer sounds good.</font>

632
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,240
<font color="yellow">Why don't we work with Goldline?</font>

633
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,110
<font color="yellow">Only if...</font>

634
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,470
<font color="yellow">the price of the goods stays the same,</font>

635
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,840
<font color="yellow">so the consumers won't bear the cost.</font>

636
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,310
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

637
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,310
<font color="yellow">we have a deal.</font>

638
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,410
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

639
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,040
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

640
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,270
<font color="yellow">Stop. That's enough.</font>

641
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,740
<font color="yellow">You should work with us, too.</font>

642
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,740
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

643
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,510
<font color="yellow">I'm on sabbatical this year.</font>

644
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,010
<font color="yellow">If you're going to support Bok Sil,</font>

645
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,470
<font color="yellow">I'll rest at home.</font>

646
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,270
<font color="yellow">Why? You can rest at Goldline.</font>

647
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,010
<font color="yellow">How can I rest at a company?</font>

648
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,110
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can do that?</font>

649
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
<font color="yellow">I'll give you my room.</font>

650
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,310
<font color="yellow">It's the biggest room in Goldline.</font>

651
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,410
<font color="yellow">It has blinds, so you can sleep whenever you want.</font>

652
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,840
<font color="yellow">Everything in the office pantry is free, of course.</font>

653
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,770
<font color="yellow">My place is 190m² and it has 3 rooms.</font>

654
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,140
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the room...</font>

655
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,840
<font color="yellow">that also has a bathroom in it.</font>

656
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,040
<font color="yellow">Everything in the fridge is free, of course.</font>

657
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,810
<font color="yellow">Are you making fun of me?</font>

658
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,970
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let go of me.</font>

659
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,840
<font color="yellow">I'm hugging you because I like you.</font>

660
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,440
<font color="yellow">If I say your presence makes me relaxed,</font>

661
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,240
<font color="yellow">would you believe me?</font>

662
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh, go away.</font>

663
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,880
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

664
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,770
<font color="yellow">Look at it.</font>

665
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,210
<font color="yellow">Hello, everyone.</font>

666
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,610
<font color="yellow">- Mr Louis!
- Mr Louis!</font>

667
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,440
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello, Mr Louis.</font>

668
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,140
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Louis.</font>

669
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,510
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to stay in Paris for a while.</font>

670
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,470
<font color="yellow">You must be surprised to see me again so soon.</font>

671
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,710
<font color="yellow">No, I'm so happy to see you.</font>

672
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,610
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

673
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,940
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for the warm welcome.</font>

674
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,770
<font color="yellow">Let's work hard together and have fun.</font>

675
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,840
<font color="yellow">- Okay!
- Okay!</font>

676
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,040
<font color="yellow">- It's so exciting!
- Go, team!</font>

677
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,880
<font color="yellow">I shall introduce new team members to you.</font>

678
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,570
<font color="yellow">There they are.</font>

679
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,640
<font color="yellow">Cha Joong Won and...</font>

680
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,470
<font color="yellow">These two will manage our branch, Singsingline.</font>

681
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,010
<font color="yellow">Please meet the CEO, Ms Ko, and the director, Mr Cha.</font>

682
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,940
<font color="yellow">I look forward to working with you all.</font>

683
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,840
<font color="yellow">You fools. How have you been?</font>

684
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,510
<font color="yellow">- Good!
- Good!</font>

685
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,310
<font color="yellow">This meeting room will be Singsingline's office.</font>

686
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,740
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha, you can use your old office.</font>

687
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,140
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What about you, Mr Louis?</font>

688
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,380
<font color="yellow">Well, I will be... Okay. It's here.</font>

689
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,670
<font color="yellow">Hello. You can put it down here.</font>

690
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,140
<font color="yellow">I'll just sit here.</font>

691
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,570
<font color="yellow">- Is he a security guard or what?
- I see.</font>

692
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:29,110
<font color="yellow">- Does he think he's a secretary?
- He's a romanticist.</font>

693
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,740
<font color="yellow">Shall we have a quick meeting now?</font>

694
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,110
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

695
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,570
<font color="yellow">Goodness. He's certainly not all there.</font>

696
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,740
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam.</font>

697
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,540
<font color="yellow">Are you not familiar with the multiplication table?</font>

698
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,210
<font color="yellow">I am, of course.</font>

699
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,410
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam is studying and sitting in that comfortable chair.</font>

700
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,310
<font color="yellow">- What are we doing right now?
- Shut it.</font>

701
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,270
<font color="yellow">- I much prefer peeling garlic.
- I agree.</font>

702
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,570
<font color="yellow">- Peel all of mine, then.
- No, I don't want to.</font>

703
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,040
<font color="yellow">- You peel all of these.
- No.</font>

704
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,210
<font color="yellow">- Take everything.
- You peel them all.</font>

705
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,810
<font color="yellow">Work hard! You little...</font>

706
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,510
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my. This house is beautiful.
- Bok Sil!</font>

707
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,910
<font color="yellow">- It's decorated so tastefully.
- Don't embarrass me, Mum.</font>

708
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,610
<font color="yellow">- Thanks for coming, Ms Hwang.
- Hello, Ms Choi.</font>

709
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,470
<font color="yellow">Thank you for inviting us.</font>

710
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,740
<font color="yellow">I should've invited you sooner.</font>

711
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,270
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

712
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,040
<font color="yellow">Is the job hard?</font>

713
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,910
<font color="yellow">Do you girls need a hand?</font>

714
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,170
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

715
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,970
<font color="yellow">I'll sing for you so that you can work harder.</font>

716
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,670
<font color="yellow">- What did he just say?
- Is he teasing us?</font>

717
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,670
<font color="yellow">Is he the grasshopper in the fable?</font>

719
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,240
<font color="yellow">In this moment.</font>

720
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,410
<font color="yellow">At this place.</font>

721
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:53,040
<font color="yellow">The moment I desperately wanted.</font>

722
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,570
<font color="yellow">And hoped for.</font>

723
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,210
<font color="yellow">My dreams.</font>

724
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,710
<font color="yellow">My wishes.</font>

725
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:07,170
<font color="yellow">They may come true.</font>

726
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,810
<font color="yellow">Right here today.</font>

727
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,840
<font color="yellow">In this moment.</font>

728
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,310
<font color="yellow">At this place.</font>

729
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,610
<font color="yellow">Words can't describe how I'm feeling.</font>

730
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,010
<font color="yellow">Right in this moment.</font>

731
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,510
<font color="yellow">The moments I've endured.</font>

732
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:32,170
<font color="yellow">And the difficult times I've been through.</font>

733
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,880
<font color="yellow">Are dissipating in front of my eyes.</font>

734
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:42,910
<font color="yellow">They're disappearing like a cloud of smoke.</font>

735
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,510
<font color="yellow">In this moment.</font>

736
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,110
<font color="yellow">Like magic</font>

737
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,770
<font color="yellow">I throw away the chains.</font>

738
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:57,810
<font color="yellow">That held me down.</font>

739
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,510
<font color="yellow">The only thing</font>

740
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,270
<font color="yellow">I have now is certainty.</font>

741
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:07,340
<font color="yellow">The only thing.</font>

742
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,710
<font color="yellow">That remains is victory.</font>

743
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,640
<font color="yellow">In this moment</font>

744
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:21,140
<font color="yellow">I'm on my own path.</font>

745
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,770
<font color="yellow">Even if you abandon me.</font>

746
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:28,040
<font color="yellow">And curse me</font>

747
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,810
<font color="yellow">I won't give up.</font>

748
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:34,040
<font color="yellow">The dream deep within my heart.</font>

749
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,040
<font color="yellow">It's my earnest prayer.</font>

750
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,270
<font color="yellow">My ardent prayer.</font>

751
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,510
<font color="yellow">This house has gotten noisy since Louis came back.</font>

752
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,110
<font color="yellow">I won't let anyone in if it bothers you.</font>

753
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,840
<font color="yellow">No, I like it because it feels lively.</font>

754
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,470
<font color="yellow">My whole life, I've lived in this huge mansion alone.</font>

755
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,810
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I lived like that.</font>

756
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,170
<font color="yellow">I even sent...</font>

757
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,810
<font color="yellow">my treasure, Ji Sung, to that faraway land.</font>

758
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,610
<font color="yellow">I don't think my Louis...</font>

759
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,470
<font color="yellow">will make the mistakes that I've made.</font>

760
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,440
<font color="yellow">Losing his memory...</font>

761
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,270
<font color="yellow">taught him how to live well with people.</font>

762
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,870
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

763
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,570
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you look into what I asked you to find out?</font>

764
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,370
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

765
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,510
<font color="yellow">I don't think we can expect Mr Louis Junior.</font>

766
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:43,740
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

767
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,610
<font color="yellow">That's so odd. It was certainly a conception dream.</font>

768
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,440
<font color="yellow">I guess I was wrong.</font>

769
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:57,940
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

770
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,570
<font color="yellow">what's going on with Louis' treasure box?</font>

771
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,810
<font color="yellow">Mr Louis finally remembered where it is.</font>

772
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,040
<font color="yellow">Really? Where is it?</font>

773
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,840
<font color="yellow">He said it's at the house in Busan.</font>

774
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,770
<font color="yellow">I'll go to Busan right away.</font>

775
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,540
<font color="yellow">- Yes, hurry up. Go now.
- Yes, Ma'am.</font>

776
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,510
<font color="yellow">Jung Ran.</font>

777
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,470
<font color="yellow">What is it? What's the matter?</font>

778
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,540
<font color="yellow">Are you pregnant by any chance?</font>

779
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,110
<font color="yellow">Be quiet! My goodness.</font>

780
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,810
<font color="yellow">We just got back from Busan. How can you say such a thing?</font>

781
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,040
<font color="yellow">Well, Ms Choi told me about her dream.</font>

782
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,870
<font color="yellow">Her dreams usually come true, you know.</font>

783
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,710
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. Shut it already.</font>

784
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,970
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

785
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,910
<font color="yellow">By the way, can Bok Nam really stay at your grandmother's place?</font>

786
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,170
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to inconvenience her.
- Don't worry.</font>

787
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,540
<font color="yellow">I told you numerous times that I'll take care of him.</font>

788
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,140
<font color="yellow">Also, Mr Kim told me...</font>

789
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:05,040
<font color="yellow">that Bok Nam's grades will barely improve...</font>

790
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,470
<font color="yellow">even if they lock him up there...</font>

791
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,840
<font color="yellow">and make him study all the time.</font>

792
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,140
<font color="yellow">What? Is he that bad?</font>

793
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,240
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Gosh, what should I do?</font>

794
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,540
<font color="yellow">- You must be cold.
- No, I'm all right.</font>

795
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,810
<font color="yellow">- No, I'm sure you're cold.
- What?</font>

796
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,210
<font color="yellow">Who made food for us?</font>

797
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,540
<font color="yellow">I asked In Sung. I told him that I want a night snack.</font>

798
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,810
<font color="yellow">Are you going to eat again?</font>

799
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,940
<font color="yellow">As you know, I'm always hungry.</font>

800
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,740
<font color="yellow">Open it.</font>

801
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,470
<font color="yellow">What kind of dish is it?</font>

802
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,710
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look real on that little table, right?</font>

803
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,370
<font color="yellow">But it's real.</font>

804
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,710
<font color="yellow">The white gold double band model with diamond from Bulgari.</font>

805
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,140
<font color="yellow">It's obviously fake.</font>

806
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,570
<font color="yellow">- Can you afford this?
- How much is it?</font>

807
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,310
<font color="yellow">It's 30 dollars.</font>

808
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,570
<font color="yellow">I can't give you a fake ring.</font>

809
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,340
<font color="yellow">This is how I really feel about you.</font>

810
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,770
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

811
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,370
<font color="yellow">I would have bought that ring if I had 30 dollars.</font>

812
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,970
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Louis.</font>

813
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,540
<font color="yellow">Just a second, Louis.</font>

814
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,370
<font color="yellow">Isn't it hot in here?</font>

815
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:58,210
<font color="yellow">I know that it'll be summer soon, but it's already so hot.</font>

816
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,270
<font color="yellow">Shall we step out for coffee?</font>

817
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,940
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

818
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,170
<font color="yellow">Let's stay in. I'll make coffee.</font>

819
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,270
<font color="yellow">What has gotten into you?</font>

820
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,110
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to get water on your hand as you have the ring on.</font>

821
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:25,510
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

822
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,910
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

823
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,810
<font color="yellow">How did you know that it was there?</font>

824
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,740
<font color="yellow">I moved it there when you were gone.</font>

825
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,210
<font color="yellow">I actually...</font>

826
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,510
<font color="yellow">came here every day.</font>

827
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,970
<font color="yellow">I cleaned the room...</font>

828
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,210
<font color="yellow">and had coffee every day.</font>

829
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,440
<font color="yellow">I put pennies into your piggy bank, too.</font>

830
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,140
<font color="yellow">Why does it feel like it's getting heavier day by day?</font>

831
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Bok Sil will be here soon.</font>

832
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,010
<font color="yellow">And I left...</font>

833
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,370
<font color="yellow">before you got home.</font>

834
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,170
<font color="yellow">From when you get on the bus to go to work...</font>

835
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,540
<font color="yellow">to the moment your light goes off...</font>

836
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,470
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams, Bok Sil.</font>

837
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,470
<font color="yellow">I've been watching you every single day.</font>

838
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I've been watching you secretly.</font>

840
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,370
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Louis.</font>

841
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,770
<font color="yellow">Let's never be apart again.</font>

842
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,770
<font color="yellow">I remembered. I remembered where I left my treasure box.</font>

843
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,510
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

844
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,270
<font color="yellow">In the attic at the house in Busan.</font>

845
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:14,110
<font color="yellow">I looked through that attic so many times.</font>

846
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:16,470
<font color="yellow">It's under the floor.</font>

847
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,610
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, the treasure box is gone.</font>

848
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,810
<font color="yellow">I think Mr Louis was mistaken.</font>

849
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,110
<font color="yellow">Really? Okay.</font>

850
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,940
<font color="yellow">Where on earth did you hide it, Ji Sung?</font>

851
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,040
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

852
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,910
<font color="yellow">Do you remember this?</font>

853
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,610
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do.</font>

854
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,640
<font color="yellow">- May I eat one?
- Of course!</font>

855
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,870
<font color="yellow">Ji Sung!</font>

856
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,610
<font color="yellow">- Ta-da.
- Ms Hong...</font>

857
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:48,770
<font color="yellow">My little prince. Who made you cry?</font>

858
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:53,040
<font color="yellow">Here. Try this.</font>

859
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,210
<font color="yellow">Your grandma and Mr Kim will scold me if they see this. Hurry up.</font>

860
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,410
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. It's chocolate.</font>

861
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,370
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

862
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,810
<font color="yellow">- Is it?
- Yes.</font>

863
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,910
<font color="yellow">- Eat slowly, okay?
- Okay.</font>

864
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:17,810
<font color="yellow">Ms Hong.</font>

865
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,970
<font color="yellow">Did you give sweets to Mr Louis again?</font>

866
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,440
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

867
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,110
<font color="yellow">- Is it good?
- Yes.</font>

868
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,610
<font color="yellow">It tastes just like how I remember it from my childhood.</font>

869
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,840
<font color="yellow">You don't have to hide it any more.</font>

870
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,570
<font color="yellow">Your grandma and Mr Kim were too protective of you, don't you think?</font>

871
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,770
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

872
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,540
<font color="yellow">Ever since you came back,</font>

873
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,870
<font color="yellow">Mother has been looking happier than ever before,</font>

874
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:03,040
<font color="yellow">and things feel so much more lively at home. It's awesome.</font>

875
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,810
<font color="yellow">I'm really happy, too.</font>

876
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,240
<font color="yellow">Visit my bookstore often from now on.</font>

877
