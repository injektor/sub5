22
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,380
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,280

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,020
<font color="yellow">Don't you think Mr Cha became more handsome?</font>

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,750
<font color="yellow">Indeed. Even his moustache looks cool.</font>

34
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,680
<font color="yellow">What is this? Why is he so handsome?</font>

35

48
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,450
<font color="yellow">I don't even remember her face.</font>

49
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,920
<font color="yellow">Do you have amnesia too?</font>

50
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,150
<font color="yellow">She passed away when I was very young and so did my dad.</font>

00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,480
<font color="yellow">Oh... I see.</font>

52
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,580
<font color="yellow">I wonder if I have any family.</font>

53
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,850
<font color="yellow">Of course you do.</font>

54
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,180

57
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,180
<font color="yellow">I got to see the family photo and I remember Mum and Dad's faces.</font>

58
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,920
<font color="yellow">I feel bad that it's not the same for you.</font>

74
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,150
<font color="yellow">I should've continued my sabbatical year. Why did I take this job?</font>

75
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,120
<font color="yellow">I wonder if everyone is doing a good job.</font>

76
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,880

77

78

<font color="yellow">Main page advertisement is costly.</font>

88
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,080
<font color="yellow">Main page post is costly. This isn't good enough for the special sale.</font>

91
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,450
<font color="yellow">The prices aren't competitive. Negotiate the charge fees.</font>

92
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,580
<font color="yellow">You don't need to negotiate the charge fees.</font>

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,920
<font color="yellow">keep it in his wallet like that?</font>

157
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,280
<font color="yellow">It can't be.</font>

158
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,280
<font color="yellow">Does Mr Cha like Mr Louis?</font>

159
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,550
<font color="yellow">Gosh. No way.</font>

160
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,180
<font color="yellow">We reduced our profit margin because of the distribution process,</font>

161
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,180
<font color="yellow">but we were able to earn this much of profit. This is amazing.</font>

162
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,650
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Great job.</font>

163
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,550
<font color="yellow">It's because you taught me well.</font>

164
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

165
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,120
<font color="yellow">free tomorrow?</font>

166
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,580
<font color="yellow">Do you need me for something?</font>

167
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,250
<font color="yellow">Would you go on a date with me?</font>

168
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,050
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

169
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,850
<font color="yellow">They're beautiful.</font>

170
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,680
<font color="yellow">The walk...</font>

171
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,180
<font color="yellow">and the weather are beautiful.</font>

172
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,850
<font color="yellow">Walking outside makes me feel refreshed.</font>

173
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,350
<font color="yellow">I really enjoyed today's lunch.</font>

174
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,950
<font color="yellow">You always treat me. I'll buy you lunch next time.</font>

175
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,650
<font color="yellow">Today's lunch was our last lunch together.</font>

176
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,020
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

177
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,720
<font color="yellow">We'll have to take Louis with us from now on.</font>

178
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,720
<font color="yellow">Louis won't let us eat alone together.</font>

179
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,780
<font color="yellow">He wanted to join us today, but I stopped him.</font>

180
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,780
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, Louis reminds me of a giant puppy.</font>

181
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,450
<font color="yellow">He always follows me around.</font>

182
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,550
<font color="yellow">He doesn't like me being with other people.</font>

183
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,250
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, he gets jealous when I'm with Bok Nam.</font>

184
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,680
<font color="yellow">Louis lived apart from his family for a long time,</font>

185
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,620
<font color="yellow">so he needs love and care more than average people.</font>

186
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,050
<font color="yellow">Treat him well.</font>

187
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,320
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

188
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,050
<font color="yellow">I'm very glad that...</font>

189
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,650
<font color="yellow">you're Louis' girlfriend.</font>

190
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,480
<font color="yellow">- Where are we going?
- Right.</font>

191
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,920
<font color="yellow">Wait here for me.</font>

192
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,550
<font color="yellow">Here you go, Bok Sil.</font>

193
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,820
<font color="yellow">(SAMPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE EXAM)</font>

194
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,020
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam already bought his books.</font>

195
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,120
<font color="yellow">These are for you.</font>

196
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,020
<font color="yellow">- For me?
- As I told you before,</font>

197
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,050
<font color="yellow">you can become successful.</font>

198
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,950
<font color="yellow">After getting a high school diploma, take the college entrance exam.</font>

199
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,120
<font color="yellow">You should enter the university.</font>

200
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,150
<font color="yellow">You're smart and hard-working, so you'll do well.</font>

201
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,750
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha.</font>

202
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,620
<font color="yellow">I don't know your plans with Louis,</font>

203
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,650
<font color="yellow">but I hope you won't give up your studies...</font>

204
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,250
<font color="yellow">no matter what.</font>

205
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,520
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha.</font>

206
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,780
<font color="yellow">You're such a good person.</font>

207
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,550
<font color="yellow">A good person?</font>

208
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,380
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

209
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,920
<font color="yellow">I'll always be a good person to you.</font>

210
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,050
<font color="yellow">Let's keep it that way.</font>

211
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,250
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

212
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,380
<font color="yellow">- Pay me 55 dollars.
- What?</font>

213
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
<font color="yellow">I was just kidding!</font>

214
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,820
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it cold?
- Yes.</font>

215
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,580
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

216
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,920
<font color="yellow">I think I'll throw up...</font>

217
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,650
<font color="yellow">if I smell food at all.</font>

218
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,780
<font color="yellow">You should still eat.</font>

219
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,680
<font color="yellow">Try some of this.</font>

220
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,150
<font color="yellow">I put a lot of effort in it.</font>

221
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,780
<font color="yellow">I said I can't eat right now.</font>

222
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,520
<font color="yellow">Open it.</font>

223
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,720
<font color="yellow">How amazing can it be?</font>

224
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,280
<font color="yellow">Does it look like a fake because it's on a table?</font>

225
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,920
<font color="yellow">However, it's real.</font>

226
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,220
<font color="yellow">As real as my love for you.</font>

227
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,650
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

228
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,520
<font color="yellow">Jung Ran.</font>

229
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
<font color="yellow">Please marry me.</font>

230
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,650
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry my propose is late.</font>

231
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,420
<font color="yellow">How did you come up with this idea?</font>

232
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,850
<font color="yellow">My senior colleague taught me.</font>

233
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,520
<font color="yellow">I did my research, but this was the best.</font>

234
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,250
<font color="yellow">I completely agree.</font>

235
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,450
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- We're moving in.</font>

236
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,980
<font color="yellow">We'll stay here until you get married.</font>

237
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,180
<font color="yellow">- Are you being serious?
- I also...</font>

238
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,120
<font color="yellow">want to see you get married.</font>

239
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,220
<font color="yellow">This won't make me get married.</font>

240
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,220
<font color="yellow">I know you can't live with us,</font>

241
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,050
<font color="yellow">so you'll try to get married as soon as possible.</font>

242
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,050
<font color="yellow">What kind of logic is that?</font>

243
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,120
<font color="yellow">We'll find out, won't we?</font>

244
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,620
<font color="yellow">Are you okay with ramyeon?</font>

245
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,250
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'll make it. You get some rest.</font>

246
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,550
<font color="yellow">I'll make it since you did a lot of packing.</font>

248
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,380
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

249
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,420
<font color="yellow">Are you adding plum syrup to ramyeon?</font>

250
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,180
<font color="yellow">I won't put up with it any more.</font>

251
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,380
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

252
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,450
<font color="yellow">Dad. What's wrong?</font>

253
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,220
<font color="yellow">The kitchen is mine starting today.</font>

254
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,320
<font color="yellow">Don't come in any more.</font>

255
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,780
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like this?</font>

256
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,050
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

257
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,450
<font color="yellow">there won't be any plum syrup in my kitchen...</font>

258
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,680
<font color="yellow">any more.</font>

259
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,020
<font color="yellow">Gosh, are you okay?</font>

260
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,320
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Dad.</font>

261
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,980
<font color="yellow">Why are you fighting in my kitchen?</font>

262
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,850
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

263
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,320
<font color="yellow">You can have this kitchen to yourself.</font>

264
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,920
<font color="yellow">I won't live here anyway.</font>

265
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,650
<font color="yellow">Mum, Mum.</font>

266
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,950
<font color="yellow">Is this why you came here?</font>

267
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,850
<font color="yellow">Now, I really want to get married.</font>

268
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,920
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to romanticise about marriage so much more.</font>

269
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,080
<font color="yellow">Where would she go in the middle of the night?</font>

270
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,220
<font color="yellow">I'll stay out of it, so you must take all responsibilities,</font>

271
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
<font color="yellow">okay?</font>

272
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,050
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Hey.</font>

273
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,320
<font color="yellow">Ms Baek will treat us to drinks today.</font>

274
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,020
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
- Why are you buying us drinks?</font>

275
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,750
<font color="yellow">I'll pay.</font>

276
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,290
<font color="yellow">I don't think Ms Baek can go home alone.</font>

277
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,450
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha should take her home.</font>

278
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,180
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

279
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
<font color="yellow">Why did she drink so much?</font>

280
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,720
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

281
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,180
<font color="yellow">Mum, what do you think of Mr Cha?</font>

282
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,450
<font color="yellow">Isn't he great and manly?</font>

283
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,220
<font color="yellow">Is that Mr Cha's mother?</font>

284
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,680
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

285
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,850
<font color="yellow">Gosh, please come in, Vivian.</font>

286
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for coming late at night.</font>

287
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,150
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms Shin.</font>

288
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,050
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you in a while.</font>

289
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,950
<font color="yellow">I hope I'm not disturbing your rest.</font>

290
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,080
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

291
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,420
<font color="yellow">I was just reading some poems.</font>

292
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,120
<font color="yellow">I'll do some cross-stitching before going to bed.</font>

293
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,920
<font color="yellow">Do what?</font>

294
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,480
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you're so ladylike.</font>

295
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,550
<font color="yellow">I hope you enjoy your time here.</font>

296
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,950
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

297
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,480
<font color="yellow">Now that you're already here,</font>

298
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,050
<font color="yellow">why don't we have a sleepover and invite Cleopatra, too?</font>

299
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,750
<font color="yellow">I'm in.</font>

300
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,850
<font color="yellow">Cleopatra.</font>

301
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,380
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you bought a building in Singapore?</font>

302
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,380
<font color="yellow">No, I bought a hotel.</font>

303
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,880
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you were buying something in Paris, Audrey?</font>

304
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
<font color="yellow">I'll build a hotel, too.</font>

305
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,290
<font color="yellow">What's the point of saving money? I should invest it.</font>

306
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,080
<font color="yellow">Audrey got into my land.</font>

307
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,920
<font color="yellow">Pay your taxes before you build a hotel.</font>

308
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,850
<font color="yellow">Why do I always stop in Vivian's land?</font>

309
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,620
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm on the deserted island again. I'm going bankrupt.</font>

312
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,020

<font color="yellow">Let me throw again.</font>

314
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,550

315
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,580
<font color="yellow">- Let me have another turn.

<font color="yellow">Vivian,</font>

317
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,680
<font color="yellow">why did you fight with your husband?</font>

318
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,350
<font color="yellow">Is it something serious?</font>

319
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

320
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,450
<font color="yellow">Come on, that's nothing.</font>

321
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,220
<font color="yellow">Is that what you fought about?</font>

322
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,750
<font color="yellow">Isn't it nice if your husband cooks for you?</font>

323
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,220
<font color="yellow">The kitchen is necessary for women to feel important,</font>

324
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,980
<font color="yellow">but he treated my plum syrup as if it's some virus.</font>

325
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,520
<font color="yellow">How could he?</font>

326
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,150
<font color="yellow">You should be grateful to have a husband at all.</font>

327
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,820
<font color="yellow">My husband died...</font>

328
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,350
<font color="yellow">a long time ago.</font>

329
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,550
<font color="yellow">I poked my thighs so many times to stay faithful to my late husband.</font>

330

331
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,790

<font color="yellow">Marriage is hard for everyone.</font>

334
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,680
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

335

358
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,520

<font color="yellow">Well, I thought you should know the truth.</font>

463
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,350
<font color="yellow">It's up to you to have a crush on her or not.</font>

464
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,150
<font color="yellow">Keep it up if you can handle it,</font>

465
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,280
<font color="yellow">but stop now if that's not the case.</font>

466
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,050
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

467
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,780
<font color="yellow">what kind of unforgettable memories...</font>

468
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,080
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri and I share?</font>

469
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,780
<font color="yellow">I even pretended that I farted to save her face.</font>

470
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,420
<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

471
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,050
<font color="yellow">Well, I just don't want you to be heartbroken.</font>

472
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,650
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you this now.</font>

473
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,750
<font color="yellow">It's your choice.</font>

474
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,120
<font color="yellow">To keep going or not.</font>

475
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,320
<font color="yellow">It's up to you.</font>

476
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,350
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri, what should I do?</font>

477
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,380
<font color="yellow">Our encounter was</font>

478
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,620
<font color="yellow">You only live once.</font>

479
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,650
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to give you my all, Ma Ri.</font>

480
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

481
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,150
<font color="yellow">I love you, Ma Ri.</font>

482
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,880
<font color="yellow">I love you! Ma Ri.</font>

483
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,150
<font color="yellow">I should get married soon, too.</font>

484
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,650
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, marry me.</font>

485
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,520
<font color="yellow">Not this one.</font>

486
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,120
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, let's live together.</font>

487
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,550
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

488
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

489
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,580
<font color="yellow">Let's eat together for the rest of our lives.</font>

490
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,550
<font color="yellow">Not that one.</font>

491
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,620
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

492
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,820
<font color="yellow">Stay by my side forever.</font>

493
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
<font color="yellow">That's no good, either.</font>

494
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,480
<font color="yellow">What should I say?</font>

495
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,020
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

496
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,950
<font color="yellow">As of today, you're my woman...</font>

497
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,480
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what should I do...</font>

498
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,780
<font color="yellow">I told you. I don't care whether she's a doctor or not.</font>

499
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,920
<font color="yellow">I won't go on blind dates.</font>

500
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,550
<font color="yellow">I'm going to find someone I like and date her freely.</font>

501
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,520
<font color="yellow">You can't control these things. Give up already, Mum.</font>

502
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,480
<font color="yellow">What's this now? She looks like a North Korean spy.</font>

503
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,690
<font color="yellow">Is she here for me?</font>

504
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,080
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

505
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,850
<font color="yellow">Please spare me a few minutes.</font>

506
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,720
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

507
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,020
<font color="yellow">Let go! Let go of me!</font>

508
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,690
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

509
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,450
<font color="yellow">You're a psycho.</font>

510
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,080
<font color="yellow">Buy ginseng.</font>

511
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,450
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

512
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,650
<font color="yellow">Buy wild ginseng.</font>

513
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,190
<font color="yellow">It may not look like anything special,</font>

514
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,320
<font color="yellow">but it's real 15-year-old ginseng.</font>

515
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,050
<font color="yellow">Here. Please have a look.</font>

516
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,080
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look that special, but it's real 50-year-old ginseng.</font>

517
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,320
<font color="yellow">I came to Seoul today, but I got my bag stolen in the train.</font>

518
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,020
<font color="yellow">Did you also get your bag stolen...</font>

519
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,520
<font color="yellow">upon arriving in Seoul?</font>

520
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,950
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

521
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,920
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me to buy your ginseng all of a sudden?</font>

522
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,350
<font color="yellow">Come and have a look.</font>

523
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,050
<font color="yellow">Look at this. Examining the head...</font>

524
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,690
<font color="yellow">tells you whether it's real or not.</font>

525
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,450
<font color="yellow">Look at this. The head tells you...</font>

526
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,220
<font color="yellow">whether it's real wild ginseng or not.</font>

527
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,420
<font color="yellow">This is 100 percent real wild ginseng.</font>

528
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,880
<font color="yellow">I harvested it myself. If you don't buy it, you'll regret it.</font>

529
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,450
<font color="yellow">You don't even need to examine this. It's cultivated ginseng.</font>

530
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,190
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

531
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,190
<font color="yellow">How do you know?</font>

532
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,650
<font color="yellow">I know because I have a lot of experience with wild ginseng.</font>

533
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,690
<font color="yellow">So just tell me why you're telling me to buy this.</font>

534
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,620
<font color="yellow">This is one-of-a-kind wild ginseng.</font>

535
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,880
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to find ginseng like this even if you travel...</font>

536
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,380
<font color="yellow">the entire country or all over the world!</font>

537
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,550
<font color="yellow">What's the reason?</font>

538
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,080
<font color="yellow">Is this also one-of-a-kind ginseng?</font>

539
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,450
<font color="yellow">I have no idea...</font>

540
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,720
<font color="yellow">what you're talking about now.</font>

541
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,750
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

542
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,950
<font color="yellow">To be honest, my parents...</font>

543
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,120
<font color="yellow">became ill all of a sudden.</font>

544
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,520
<font color="yellow">Hence, I'm in urgent need of money.</font>

545
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,850
<font color="yellow">How much do you want to sell it for?</font>

546
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,950
<font color="yellow">I don't want to sell it to you.</font>

547
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,720
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

548
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,690
<font color="yellow">I want a contract with Singsingline.</font>

549
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
<font color="yellow">How daring.</font>

550
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,020
<font color="yellow">I see. So you're not here to sell this box of ginseng.</font>

551
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,650
<font color="yellow">You want a contract.</font>

552
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,250
<font color="yellow">My family has a ginseng field.</font>

553
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,380
<font color="yellow">You probably know that Geumsan...</font>

554
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,480
<font color="yellow">is famous for ginseng grown in the region.</font>

555
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,450
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're a seasoned salesperson.</font>

556
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,880
<font color="yellow">I have to look after my parents,</font>

557
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,950
<font color="yellow">so I don't have time to be explaining all the details.</font>

558
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,050
<font color="yellow">There's the saying, "Make haste slowly."</font>

559
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,550
<font color="yellow">Since I'm already here, I'd like to secure a good client.</font>

560
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,920
<font color="yellow">It looks like you have a good eye,</font>

561
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,780
<font color="yellow">so I won't say more.</font>

562
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,350
<font color="yellow">She certainly has a knack for sales.</font>

563
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,920
<font color="yellow">But why do you want to work with Singsingline?</font>

564
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,580
<font color="yellow">Singsingline is the best.</font>

565
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,220
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

566
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,420
<font color="yellow">I should've introduced myself first.</font>

567
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,220
<font color="yellow">My name is Wang Mong Sil. Wang Mong Sil.</font>

568
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,950
<font color="yellow">Farewell to you, Ko Bok Sil.</font>

569
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,750
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

570
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,650
<font color="yellow">I look forward to working with you.</font>

571
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,220
<font color="yellow">- Bok Sil, I'm here.
- Hi.</font>

572
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,690
<font color="yellow">Louis!</font>

573
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,280
<font color="yellow">- You're here, too.
- I want to rest at home today.</font>

574
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,320
<font color="yellow">The streets get too crowded on weekends.</font>

575
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,050
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

576
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,380
<font color="yellow">I made ramyeon. Come join us. Bok Nam said he was craving it.</font>

577
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,520
<font color="yellow">- I did a good job, right?
- Yes.</font>

578
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,520
<font color="yellow">I wanted to take Bok Sil out for food.</font>

579
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,750
<font color="yellow">Louis and Bok Nam, get the table ready.</font>

580
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

581
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,920
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

582
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:32,944
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

583
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,150
<font color="yellow">It's so good.</font>

584
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,450
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

585
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

586
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,720
<font color="yellow">Where did this come from?</font>

587
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,620
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

588
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,620
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ms Hong. What's going on?</font>

589
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,080
<font color="yellow">Louis, I have a gift for you.</font>

590
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,580
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

591
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,380
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

592
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,780
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

593
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,350
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

594
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,020
<font color="yellow">You can't sleep again?</font>

595
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,380
<font color="yellow">I'm so excited. My heart is pumping so hard.</font>

596
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,650
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

597
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,190
<font color="yellow">About watching a film.</font>

598
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,750
<font color="yellow">What film?</font>

599
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,820
<font color="yellow">We said we'd watch a film together but haven't done it yet.</font>

600
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,480
<font color="yellow">It's too scary.</font>

601
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,480
<font color="yellow">That was the first film I've ever watched.</font>

602
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,550
<font color="yellow">Hey, what was that about?</font>

603
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,380
<font color="yellow">Well, I brought you because it was free.</font>

604
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,250
<font color="yellow">Let's watch a non-scary one next time.</font>

605
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, something that's not scary.</font>

606
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,050
<font color="yellow">I'm going to say no to a horror film.</font>

607
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,750
<font color="yellow">It's a touching one.</font>

608
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,620
<font color="yellow">Why is it empty?</font>

609
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,380
<font color="yellow">We're the only ones here.</font>

610
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,420
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

611
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,150
<font color="yellow">I rented the entire cinema.</font>

612
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,190
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

613
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,250
<font color="yellow">I wanted to watch it with just you.</font>

614
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,650
<font color="yellow">What is the film about?</font>
