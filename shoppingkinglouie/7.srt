<font color="yellow">I went out because...</font>

154
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,830
<font color="yellow">some girls said they would tell me where Bok Nam is if I pay them.</font>

155
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,100
<font color="yellow">So? Did you meet Bok Nam?</font>

156
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,330
<font color="yellow">He wasn't there.</font>

157
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,430
<font color="yellow">- How much did you pay them?
- 1,000 dollars.</font>

158
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,400
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What?</font>

159
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,070
<font color="yellow">Is it your job to get conned?</font>

160
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you all so dumb?</font>

161
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,400
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. You should've told me about this first.</font>

162
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,730
<font color="yellow">- I'm the smart one, you know.
- Are you kidding right now?</font>

163
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,900
<font color="yellow">- You're no better.
- I know.</font>

164
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,430
<font color="yellow">Thinking that I have to take care of all of you...</font>

165
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,330
<font color="yellow">makes me feel so hopeless.</font>

166
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,460
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear me. What a fate.</font>

167
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,500
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

168
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,530
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. I'll get that money back for you.</font>

169
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,330
<font color="yellow">- Just trust me.
- Okay.</font>

170
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,830
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is so frustrating.</font>

171
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,500
<font color="yellow">Do you really trust him?</font>

172
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,130
<font color="yellow">Why would you trust the things someone so dumb like him says?</font>

173
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,430
<font color="yellow">Leave them be.</font>

174
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,430
<font color="yellow">They have some kind of...</font>

175
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,360
<font color="yellow">a belief system that you'd never understand. Just go to sleep.</font>

176
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,730
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I'll get sick just by looking at you.</font>

177
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,200
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

178
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,500
<font color="yellow">was the man on the ambulance the burglar?</font>

179
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,460
<font color="yellow">Why would someone burgle someone so poor like you?</font>

180
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,130
<font color="yellow">Who is the person who attacked the burglar?</font>

181
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,500
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,660
<font color="yellow">It can't be the same criminal who hasn't been caught yet, can it?</font>

183
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,160
<font color="yellow">Maybe a serial killer does live in our neighbourhood.</font>

184
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,330
<font color="yellow">This is the third incident.</font>

185
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,460
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it gives me the chills.</font>

186
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,930
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Why did the policeman...</font>

187
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,400
<font color="yellow">ask me so many questions?</font>

188
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,760
<font color="yellow">I know. That didn't feel good.</font>

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,260
<font color="yellow">Hey. What if...</font>

190
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,200
<font color="yellow">- they're suspecting you?
- What?</font>

191
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,560
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

192
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,760
<font color="yellow">- Go to sleep!
- Yes, Ma'am.</font>

193
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,030
<font color="yellow">I'm at the crime scene in Eunsung-dong.</font>

194
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I've never seen such a mess.</font>

195
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,160
<font color="yellow">It's full of reporters and cameras outside.</font>

196
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,360
<font color="yellow">This alley is already so small.</font>

197
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,760
<font color="yellow">It'll be full of people now.</font>

198
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,460
<font color="yellow">The fact that I'm at the heart of the scene...</font>

199
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,400
<font color="yellow">which everyone is talking about excites me so much.</font>

200
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
<font color="yellow">It's so overwhelming.</font>

201
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,460
<font color="yellow">What's so exciting about that?</font>

202
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,060
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, I want some ham.</font>

203
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,800
<font color="yellow">Ms Hwang.</font>

204
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,360
<font color="yellow">Do you have any ham?</font>

205
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,500
<font color="yellow">I want some Maxim Gold coffee before that.</font>

206
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,200
<font color="yellow">Where's the coffee?</font>

207
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,330
<font color="yellow">Gosh, will you look at him?</font>

208
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,300
<font color="yellow">- Look how picky he is.
- Pardon me?</font>

209
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,230
<font color="yellow">You aren't the only one eating.</font>

210
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,800
<font color="yellow">It's so delicious.</font>

211
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,430
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, I want some water.</font>

212
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,700
<font color="yellow">I want some more ham.</font>

213
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,330
<font color="yellow">- Do you have cold water?
- Cold water?</font>

214
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,660
<font color="yellow">I want to have some fish for dinner.</font>

215
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,460
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

216
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,800
<font color="yellow">You do all kinds of things, don't you?</font>

217
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,900
<font color="yellow">(MAID 1, 2, 3)</font>

218
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,930
<font color="yellow">Goodness, bring the rag. I have to clean up now.</font>

219
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,330
<font color="yellow">- I want fish.
- Gosh, why you...</font>

220
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,660
<font color="yellow">Regarding the Eunsung-dong attack,</font>

221
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,700
<font color="yellow">the police think it could be a serial murder...</font>

222
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,530
<font color="yellow">since two similar incidents happened in the area 3 and 6 months ago...</font>

223
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,260
<font color="yellow">and are carrying out the investigation.</font>

224
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,330
<font color="yellow">However, it was found that the victim who was injured...</font>

225
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,760
<font color="yellow">and underwent a surgery yesterday...</font>

226
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,960
<font color="yellow">was not the resident at the scene of the crime.</font>

227
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,400
<font color="yellow">It's expected to cause confusion in the police investigation.</font>

228
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,560
<font color="yellow">As soon as we receive updates...</font>

229
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,430
<font color="yellow">- The police said...
- That place...</font>

230
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,830
<font color="yellow">seems familiar for some reason.</font>

231
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,260
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. You're scaring me.</font>

232
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,760
<font color="yellow">What a scary world.</font>

233
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,960
<font color="yellow">- Always be careful, Ma Ri.
- Sure.</font>

234
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,700
<font color="yellow">The police assume that the culprit...</font>

235
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,230
<font color="yellow">- could be a serial killer.
- Our neighbourhood should be okay.</font>

236
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,430
<font color="yellow">- It should be.
- Right.</font>

237
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,160
<font color="yellow">- It's so scary.
- Currently, the police are...</font>

238
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,160
<font color="yellow">Dad, are you okay?</font>

239
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,730
<font color="yellow">You don't look well.</font>

240
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,830
<font color="yellow">Honey, go to Busan for a while.</font>

241
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,830
<font color="yellow">To Mother's?</font>

242
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,030
<font color="yellow">Make sure Mother doesn't watch the news.</font>

243
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,030
<font color="yellow">If she's about to watch the news, switch the channel.</font>

244
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,030
<font color="yellow">Why? Why shouldn't she watch the news?</font>

245
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,460
<font color="yellow">Just do as I say.</font>

246
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,560
<font color="yellow">- Don't ask why.
- What's the problem now?</font>

247
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,530
<font color="yellow">On the way to Busan. It's a lonely journey.</font>

248
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,200
<font color="yellow">She travels by herself.</font>

249
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,130
<font color="yellow">What does she do?</font>

250
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,030
<font color="yellow">- Honey, look at this photo.
- What?</font>

251
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,830
<font color="yellow">- Is it a selfie taken in the car?
- Yes.</font>

252
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,460
<font color="yellow">Is a chauffeur driving? The seat looks high-quality, too.</font>

253
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,360
<font color="yellow">- Look at it.
- It's a nice car.</font>

254
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,830
<font color="yellow">She's a VVIP at a department store.</font>

255
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,600
<font color="yellow">She must be very rich. What might her husband do?</font>

256
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,360
<font color="yellow">I'll dig into it next time we meet.</font>

257
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,660
<font color="yellow">Is it going well? Do you want some help?</font>

258
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,760
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine. I'll do all the cooking.</font>

259
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,460
<font color="yellow">You just focus on your phone.</font>

260
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,500
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

261
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,030
<font color="yellow">All the numbers on the call history are registered under someone else.</font>

262
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,100
<font color="yellow">What if the person in the hospital is a hitman?</font>

263
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,200
<font color="yellow">- Is he awake yet?
- No, he's still unconscious.</font>

264
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,030
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

265
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,660
<font color="yellow">We received the fingerprint results from National Forensic Service.</font>

266
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,160
<font color="yellow">- The fingerprints belong to one.
- Whose?</font>

267
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,530
<font color="yellow">Louis, the tenant of the rooftop. He's had a memory loss.</font>

268
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,430
<font color="yellow">A memory loss?</font>

269
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,560
<font color="yellow">He was at the scene of the crime yesterday.</font>

270
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,130
<font color="yellow">I got his fingerprints because I couldn't check his identification.</font>

271
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,330
<font color="yellow">- These are the results.
- Since when did he live there?</font>

272
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,600
<font color="yellow">- He...
- It hasn't been long.</font>

273
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,160
<font color="yellow">Just a little over a month.</font>

274
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,430
<font color="yellow">- How do you know that?
- I know him.</font>

275
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,300
<font color="yellow">He's not the culprit.</font>

276
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,360
<font color="yellow">He's not daring enough to do such thing.</font>

277
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,270
<font color="yellow">I don't care. Bring Louis here.</font>

278
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,030
<font color="yellow">Let's get this over with.</font>

279
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,270
<font color="yellow">You don't know your name. You don't know your age.</font>

280
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,130
<font color="yellow">You have no occupation.</font>

281
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,000
<font color="yellow">Your address is the scene of the crime.</font>

282
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,830
<font color="yellow">At the time of the crime,</font>

283
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
<font color="yellow">you went to the bus stop,</font>

284
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,660
<font color="yellow">but you have no alibi.</font>

285
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,000
<font color="yellow">You left your cell phone at home, right?</font>

286
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,900
<font color="yellow">I absolutely didn't do it.</font>

287
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,000
<font color="yellow">The hammer was covered with your fingerprints.</font>

288
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,530
<font color="yellow">How will you explain that?</font>

289
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,770
<font color="yellow">I used it to peel garlic.</font>

290
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,800
<font color="yellow">How do you peel garlic with a hammer?</font>

291
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,900
<font color="yellow">I thought it'd work. It was my first time peeling a garlic.</font>

292
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not a bad person.</font>

293
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,300
<font color="yellow">Detective.</font>

294
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,730
<font color="yellow">He can't even kill an insect.</font>

295
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,800
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

296
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,270
<font color="yellow">You should rest at home on your day off.</font>

297
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,660
<font color="yellow">Why would you go and exercise?</font>

298
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,030
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat. I added some ice.</font>

299
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,430
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

300
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,530
<font color="yellow">- You must have made it.
- It's delicious, isn't it?</font>

301
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,960
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- You didn't add plum extract?</font>

302
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,560
<font color="yellow">- I forgot.
- How could you forget that?</font>

303
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,830
<font color="yellow">- I'm done.
- I'm done, too.</font>

304
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,830
<font color="yellow">You're done already?</font>

305
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,600
<font color="yellow">Joong Won.</font>

306
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,730
<font color="yellow">Between you and the naked boy at yours...</font>

307
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,630
<font color="yellow">There is nothing going on, right?</font>

308
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,000
<font color="yellow">I told you many times. I just took him in out of pity.</font>

309
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,960
<font color="yellow">He moved out, so I don't live with him any more.</font>

310
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,300
<font color="yellow">Young Ae, let's stop bothering him...</font>

311
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,560
<font color="yellow">and watch television instead.</font>

312
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,130
<font color="yellow">- That sounds good.
- Okay.</font>

313
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,800
<font color="yellow">I wonder if the suspect is caught.</font>

314
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,030
<font color="yellow">- It's the talk of the town.
- As you can see, the crime scene...</font>

315
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,460
<font color="yellow">is crowded with investigators and reporters.</font>

316
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,530
<font color="yellow">The crime that took place in this rooftop room...</font>

317
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,930
<font color="yellow">- is the same place...
- That's Bok Sil's place.</font>

318
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,300
<font color="yellow">Where murder cases happened 3 and 6 months ago.</font>

319
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,600
<font color="yellow">The police assume the culprit...</font>

320
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,270
<font color="yellow">- could commit another crime soon, - Bok Sil, where are you right now?</font>

321
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,700
<font color="yellow">And are carrying out an investigation.</font>

322
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

323
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:32,724
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

324
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,460
<font color="yellow">Are you back again?</font>

325
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,630
<font color="yellow">How old am I?</font>

326
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,160
<font color="yellow">I'm 21 years old,</font>

327
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,500
<font color="yellow">so maybe 20?</font>

328
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,830
<font color="yellow">Am I younger than you?</font>

329
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,630
<font color="yellow">You behave like a little kid,</font>

330
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,330
<font color="yellow">but because of your face, I think you could be 20.</font>

331
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,000
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

332
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,560
<font color="yellow">Not knowing myself...</font>

333
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,270
<font color="yellow">is a really scary thing.</font>

334
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,800
<font color="yellow">Perhaps,</font>

335
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,530
<font color="yellow">I'm a bad criminal.</font>

336
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,030
<font color="yellow">You could've been a monk who doesn't know about this world.</font>

337
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,200
<font color="yellow">What if I was being chased by loan sharks?</font>

338
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,500
<font color="yellow">I bet you were someone rich who spent a lot of money.</font>

339
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,500
<font color="yellow">- I might be an orphan.
- I think...</font>

340
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,930
<font color="yellow">a good family took care of you.</font>

341
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,830
<font color="yellow">I could be married and have a wife.</font>

342
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,530
<font color="yellow">I hope that isn't the case.</font>

343
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,430
<font color="yellow">Someone with all possibilities and impossibilities.</font>

344
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,430
<font color="yellow">That's me.</font>

345
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,100
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

346
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,560
<font color="yellow">You're kind, beautiful and lovely.</font>

347
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
<font color="yellow">I can just tell.</font>

348
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,260
<font color="yellow">Everyone shows...</font>

349
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,660
<font color="yellow">his past self in the present.</font>

350
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,100
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

351
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing?</font>

352
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

353
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,200
<font color="yellow">Look, everyone. Isn't it good to be young?</font>

354
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

355
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,830
<font color="yellow">Wow, that's great.</font>

356
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,830
<font color="yellow">- Be quiet.
- Look at them.</font>

357
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,360
<font color="yellow">Stay away from her!</font>

358
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,130
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Mr Cha.</font>

359
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,260
<font color="yellow">His fingerprints were found on the weapon,</font>

360
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,800
<font color="yellow">and he can't prove his alibi.</font>

361
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,100
<font color="yellow">Can't you check the location of his mobile phone then?</font>

362
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,300
<font color="yellow">He left his phone at home that night.</font>

363
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,700
<font color="yellow">We thought maybe it was an excessive self-defence,</font>

364
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,260
<font color="yellow">but the means of the crime is the same as for the last two incidents.</font>

365
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,660
<font color="yellow">More importantly, we can't be sure of his past.</font>

366
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,230
<font color="yellow">- Do you know he had a memory loss?
- Of course.</font>

367
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,530
<font color="yellow">I'll be his personal reference.</font>

368
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,030
<font color="yellow">I said I'll be his personal reference as well.</font>

369
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,400
<font color="yellow">- I told you. It's not them.
- Detective.</font>

370
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,500
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. You'll be fine. Don't worry. You, too, Louis.</font>

371
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,900
<font color="yellow">We can't find the criminal's footprints on our database.</font>

372
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,430
<font color="yellow">What kind of shoes was he wearing?</font>

373
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,330
<font color="yellow">Bont Riot's custom thermoformed shoes.</font>

374
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,760
<font color="yellow">They're cycling shoes.</font>

375
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,460
<font color="yellow">They thermoform the shoes with carbon fibre according to...</font>

376
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,400
<font color="yellow">the rider's foot. You won't find the same pattern anywhere.</font>

377
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,630
<font color="yellow">It's customised.</font>

378
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
<font color="yellow">These.</font>

379
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,460
<font color="yellow">Those shoes look like these.</font>

380
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,600
<font color="yellow">Not a lot of place sells those kind of shoes. You can start from there.</font>

381
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,160
<font color="yellow">Maybe the criminal is someone who is good at cycling.</font>

382
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,900
<font color="yellow">How did you know all that?</font>

383
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,660
<font color="yellow">Maybe you were a cyclist.</font>

384
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,300
<font color="yellow">- Can he try riding your bicycle?
- Can I?</font>

385
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,830
<font color="yellow">Sure. Go ahead.</font>

386
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,900
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't do this.</font>

387
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,400
<font color="yellow">You can't even ride a bicycle. How did you know about the shoes?</font>

388
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,260
<font color="yellow">- Were you into shoes then?
- Was I?</font>

389
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,260
<font color="yellow">You two will stay in my place for a while.</font>

390
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,000
<font color="yellow">It's annoying and troublesome, but I'm being generous.</font>

391
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

392
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,300
<font color="yellow">There is something wrong with his personality.</font>

393
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,900
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- He's looking at us.</font>

394
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,030
<font color="yellow">Let's go with him for now.</font>

395
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,600
<font color="yellow">I should be carrying them.</font>

396
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,330
<font color="yellow">My body still aches. I'm sorry, Bok Sil.</font>

397
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,230
<font color="yellow">You still have pain relief patches all over you. I'm fine.</font>

398
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,030
<font color="yellow">That punk.</font>

399
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,930
<font color="yellow">I'm not so sure about this.</font>

400
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,230
<font color="yellow">His place is very nice.</font>

401
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,230
<font color="yellow">He has a huge fridge and plenty of space.</font>

402
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,130
<font color="yellow">- He also has a lot of furniture.
- I must be out of my mind.</font>

403
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,360
<font color="yellow">What am I doing here?</font>

404
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,760
<font color="yellow">He and I must've been enemies in our past lives.</font>

405
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,800
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

406
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,600
<font color="yellow">It's all fixed. You'll like it.</font>

407
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,460
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Thank you.</font>

408
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,900
<font color="yellow">Surprise! This is a pink hat. It's your favourite colour.</font>

409
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,830
<font color="yellow">I love it.</font>

410
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
<font color="yellow">- Do I look good?
- You look great.</font>

411
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,930
<font color="yellow">Excuse me for interrupting, Ms Hong.</font>

412
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,800
<font color="yellow">- Can I ask you something privately?
- Me?</font>

413
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,630
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- It won't take long.</font>

414
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,130
<font color="yellow">Why did you touch the box I keep Mr Louis' teeth in?</font>

415
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,360
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

416
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,930
<font color="yellow">It was pretty obvious.</font>

417
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,230
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

418
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,630
<font color="yellow">You said you'll have his watch fixed. Why did you take his tooth?</font>

419
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,130
<font color="yellow">One of his upper teeth is missing.</font>

420
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,100
<font color="yellow">That's... Well...</font>

421
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,760
<font color="yellow">It's something...</font>

422
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,900
<font color="yellow">my husband asked me to do.</font>

423
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,660
<font color="yellow">I asked him why,</font>

424
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,060
<font color="yellow">but he didn't tell me.</font>

425
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,260
<font color="yellow">Maybe he wanted to keep it as some kind of a charm.</font>

426
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,530
<font color="yellow">He said it's nothing important.</font>

427
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,530
<font color="yellow">Why would he do that?</font>

428
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,830
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

429
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,430
<font color="yellow">I heard you asked your wife to bring you Mr Louis' watch and tooth.</font>

430
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,000
<font color="yellow">She told Mr Kim all about it.</font>

431
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,430
<font color="yellow">- Hello? Mr Baek?
- Dad. Is everything okay?</font>

432
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,960
<font color="yellow">Call your mum now.</font>

433
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,800
<font color="yellow">- Are you listening, Sir?
- Okay.</font>

434
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,430
<font color="yellow">It's nothing important. Thank you, Ms Heo.</font>

435
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,630
<font color="yellow">She's not answering.</font>

436
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,800
<font color="yellow">You have such a great sense of humour.</font>

437
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,330
<font color="yellow">You laugh at everything, don't you?</font>

438
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,800
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

439
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,930
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim. Turn on the TV.</font>

440
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,060
<font color="yellow">- I should watch the news.
- Yes, Ma'am.</font>

441
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh. It's been a while.</font>

442
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,030
<font color="yellow">Are you tired? Man up.</font>

443
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,800
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Can you draw me a bath? That's the bathroom.</font>

444
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,960
<font color="yellow">You should do it. I'll take a bath.</font>

445
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,730
<font color="yellow">Do it.</font>

446
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,500
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

447
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,630
<font color="yellow">Would you like a cold bath?</font>

448
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,660
<font color="yellow">- Make it 36.5℃ hot.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

449
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

450
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,700
<font color="yellow">You must know this already. He's a bit slow-witted.</font>

451
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,030
<font color="yellow">Why are you sorry?</font>

452
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,730
<font color="yellow">- Stop saying you're sorry.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll make breakfast, so you don't need to do anything.</font>

605
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,760
<font color="yellow">I don't want you touching my stuff.</font>

606
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,530
<font color="yellow">- I'll do it.
- I said I'll do it.</font>

607
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,930
<font color="yellow">- I'll just do it.
- I'm going to do it.</font>

608
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,200
<font color="yellow">- Please let me do it.
- I said I'm going to do it.</font>

609
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,260
<font color="yellow">- I want to...
- Gosh!</font>

610
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
<font color="yellow">What a waste.</font>

611
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,500
<font color="yellow">I'll clean it up. You should go to bed.</font>

612
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,830
<font color="yellow">It's fine. You go to bed.</font>

613
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,430
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha, may I give you a nickname?</font>

614
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,060
<font color="yellow">Sweet Churl.</font>

615
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,670
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

616
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,260
<font color="yellow">You sound so mean and harsh,</font>

617
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,670
<font color="yellow">but your actions are actually the opposite.</font>

618
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,670
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn to be like that?</font>

619
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,360
<font color="yellow">When was I ever sweet to you? Clean up this mess and make sure...</font>

620
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,730
<font color="yellow">you don't leave a grain of rice on the floor. Got it?</font>

621
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,260
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it. Please don't worry and get a good sleep.</font>

622
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,030
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'll make breakfast for you tomorrow.</font>

623
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,960
<font color="yellow">I'm freeloading here, so I should do that at least.</font>

624
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,730
<font color="yellow">I feel weird.</font>

625
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,730
<font color="yellow">What is this feeling?</font>

626
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,800
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep.</font>

627
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,100
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

628
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,170
<font color="yellow">Why are you already awake?</font>

629
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,730
<font color="yellow">- I couldn't sleep a wink.
- What?</font>

630
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,600
<font color="yellow">- Why? Was the bed uncomfortable?
- I felt uneasy in my heart.</font>

631
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,460
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

632
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,500
<font color="yellow">Shall I give you a hand?</font>

633
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,060
<font color="yellow">Don't cause trouble if you want to help me. Don't do anything.</font>

634
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,900
<font color="yellow">I'll just watch you, then.</font>

635
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:23,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, go and watch television or something. You're bothering me.</font>

636
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,830
<font color="yellow">No, I should at least do this.</font>

<font color="yellow">(YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER.)</font>

639
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,900
<font color="yellow">Yes! I had to get my hands on it.</font>

640
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,700
<font color="yellow">Is breakfast ready?</font>

641
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,360
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

642
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,200
<font color="yellow">Do all men own that jacket?</font>

643
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,160
<font color="yellow">I know you see this everywhere, but mine is different.</font>

644
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,760
<font color="yellow">This is that authentic limited-edition jacket,</font>

645
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,000
<font color="yellow">and his is obviously a counterfeit.</font>

646
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,400
<font color="yellow">Take a closer look. Mine is...</font>

647
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,660
<font color="yellow">a work of art where every stitch was hand-sewn by a craftsman,</font>

648
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,260
<font color="yellow">whereas this was cheaply made by digital printing.</font>

649
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,630
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm looking at them...</font>

650
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,830
<font color="yellow">You're right. They look very different.</font>

651
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,700
<font color="yellow">My gut is telling me that I probably used to wear Number One.</font>

652
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,230
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

653
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,960
<font color="yellow">Thanks for making breakfast, Bok Sil.</font>

654
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,300
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's eat, guys.</font>

655
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,460
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

656
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,500
<font color="yellow">Only I can eat what Bok Sil makes.</font>

657
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,800
<font color="yellow">- Hey, what is wrong with you?
- What?</font>

658
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,400
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

659
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,500
<font color="yellow">Only I am allowed to eat the food you make.</font>

660
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,760
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

661
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,260
<font color="yellow">- Buy whatever you want to eat.
- I don't want it.</font>

662
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,460
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling sick? You didn't eat much at breakfast,</font>

663
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,960
<font color="yellow">and you don't even want your allowance.</font>

664
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,230
<font color="yellow">- Bok Sil, let's go.
- Okay.</font>

665
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,060
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- I'll take you to work.</font>

666
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,930
<font color="yellow">- I'm taking my car.
- That's good.</font>

667
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,960
<font color="yellow">I have to stop by somewhere anyway.</font>

668
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,360
<font color="yellow">Isn't his car so cool?</font>

669
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,760
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Something is telling me that I used to own a cooler car.</font>

670
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,400
<font color="yellow">Also, I think I used to have about 100 pairs of shoes...</font>

671
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,060
<font color="yellow">and used to live in a castle-like mansion.</font>

672
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,400
<font color="yellow">- I see that you like to bluff.
- What did you just say?</font>

673
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,260
<font color="yellow">Keep it up if you think it's helpful for your mental health. I get it.</font>

674
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,530
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

675
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,730
<font color="yellow">You look more stressed out than yesterday. What is bothering you?</font>

676
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,600
<font color="yellow">Is it because of the inaugural ceremony?</font>

677
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:21,200
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri, that's not important right now.</font>

678
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,500
<font color="yellow">- I'm Kim Ho Joon.
- Yes, hello.</font>

679
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,830
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to visit you this early, but it's about an urgent matter.</font>

680
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,900
<font color="yellow">I heard from Mr Kim.</font>

681
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,100
<font color="yellow">He already met up with the director of the show.</font>

682
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,300
<font color="yellow">They'll share comments on all social media channels...</font>

683
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,630
<font color="yellow">and look for that young man together.</font>

684
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,760
<font color="yellow">The show's production team hasn't received any information yet.</font>

685
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,030
<font color="yellow">Jung Ran, you should also go to Seoul...</font>

686
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,960
<font color="yellow">- and help Mr Kim find him.
- Pardon me?</font>

687
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,500
<font color="yellow">You want me to accompany him?</font>

688
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,560
<font color="yellow">I don't want to. I'm going to have to say no.</font>

689
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,060
<font color="yellow">- Do you hate Mr Kim that much?
- Yes, I do.</font>

690
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,830
<font color="yellow">It's probably because you don't know him well yet. He's a good guy.</font>

691
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,630
<font color="yellow">He's so smart, too.</font>

692
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,230
<font color="yellow">He's also very responsible and reliable.</font>

693
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,100
<font color="yellow">Why is he still single, then?</font>

694
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,960
<font color="yellow">I guess he hasn't met the right person yet.</font>

695
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,600
<font color="yellow">Judging from his looks, I think I know the reason.</font>

696
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,030
<font color="yellow">If you really don't want to go, I can try to persuade Mother...</font>

697
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,830
<font color="yellow">not to make you go to Seoul.</font>

698
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,960
<font color="yellow">I must follow Ms Choi's order.</font>

699
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,030
<font color="yellow">I'll see you soon.</font>

700
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,660
<font color="yellow">Ms Hwang, I'll do it.</font>

701
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,730
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

702
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,700
<font color="yellow">You do important work now. Don't dirty your hands.</font>

703
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,700
<font color="yellow">You get backaches, though.</font>

704
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,260
<font color="yellow">You're so clueless.</font>

705
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,060
<font color="yellow">If you office workers clean too, I'll lose my job.</font>

706
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,160
<font color="yellow">Don't creep on my turf...</font>

707
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,830
<font color="yellow">and just focus on your work.</font>

708
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,760
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

709
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,500
<font color="yellow">Is living at the director's place going all right?</font>

710
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,030
<font color="yellow">Does he pick on the two of you by any chance?</font>

711
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

712
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,230
<font color="yellow">I'm not worried about you, but Louis worries me a lot.</font>

713
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,900
<font color="yellow">He's absolutely clueless, you know.</font>

714
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,100
<font color="yellow">He's like a little kid. He's such a handful.</font>

715
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,500
<font color="yellow">- He annoys you, right?
- Yes.</font>

716
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,400
<font color="yellow">- Give us our money back.
- What is this?</font>

717
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,100
<font color="yellow">- Who's this prankster?
- What's going on?</font>

718
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,830
<font color="yellow">What? What does he mean by that?</font>

719
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,330
<font color="yellow">Don't you know? It's the name of the King from Joseon Dynasty.</font>

720
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,360
<font color="yellow">Yeongjo, Jeongjo and Donjo. You girls don't know?</font>

721
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,930
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. You're certainly the smartest one out of us.</font>

722
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,100
<font color="yellow">I'm so impressed.</font>

723
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,300
<font color="yellow">Give us our money back. Give us our money back.</font>

724
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,060
<font color="yellow">- It keeps coming.
- Give us our money back.</font>

725
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,400
<font color="yellow">- Give us our money back.
- Block the number.</font>

726
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,100
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

727
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you really have to bombard them with text messages?</font>

728
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,830
<font color="yellow">That's why they blocked your number.</font>

729
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:34,060
<font color="yellow">You didn't even spell correctly.</font>

730
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,930
<font color="yellow">You frustrate me so much.</font>

731
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,130
<font color="yellow">You obviously need help from this smart guy here.</font>

732
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,600
<font color="yellow">Watch this, okay?</font>

733
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,630
<font color="yellow">Call them again and say this.</font>

734
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,260
<font color="yellow">"This is Officer Jo In Sung from Financial Supervisory Service."</font>

735
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,130
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember the phone scam?</font>

736
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:01,460
<font color="yellow">This is Officer Jo In Sung from Financial Supervisory Service.</font>

737
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,300
<font color="yellow">We received a report about a phone scam you recently experienced.</font>

738
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,760
<font color="yellow">Get lost, you stupid jerk!</font>

739
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,260
<font color="yellow">Hey, it won't be easy to deal with those girls.</font>

740
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,330
<font color="yellow">I know, right? I told you. They're scary.</font>

741
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,300
<font color="yellow">For this upcoming Black Friday,</font>

742
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,260
<font color="yellow">we'd like to run a big sales event.</font>

743
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,630
<font color="yellow">Then we should negotiate...</font>

744
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,730
<font color="yellow">- with the brands we carry.
- That's right.</font>

745
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,830
<font color="yellow">We need an event to encourage customers to join Goldpay.</font>

746
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,730
<font color="yellow">Also, think about how we're going to promote the event online.</font>

747
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,500
<font color="yellow">How about we create a separate tab for the event on the main page?</font>

748
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,730
<font color="yellow">We'll consider it if many brands confirm their participation.</font>

749
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,360
<font color="yellow">I sense a serious increase in our workload.</font>

750

763

<font color="yellow">No, he's fine.</font>

764
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,230
<font color="yellow">The injured victim is someone else, so don't worry.</font>

765
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,030
<font color="yellow">First and foremost,</font>

766

767
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,800

768
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,730
<font color="yellow">Bring it up as naturally as possible.</font>

773
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,430

774
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,900
