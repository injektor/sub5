<font color="yellow">Why are you shopping in the morning? It's tiring.</font>

3
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,700
<font color="yellow">I feel a little depressed.</font>

4
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,500
<font color="yellow">Why? Is Mr Cha bothering you?</font>

5
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,470
<font color="yellow">Is he giving you a hard time?</font>

6
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,410
<font color="yellow">No, he wouldn't.</font>

7
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,800
<font color="yellow">I bet he was surprised...</font>

8
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,610
<font color="yellow">to see himself doing the work that he assigned to others.</font>

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,800
<font color="yellow">You have a talent for making people surprised.</font>

10
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,970
<font color="yellow">I wonder when I'll get my memory back.</font>

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,770
<font color="yellow">I wonder what my job was.</font>

12
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,670
<font color="yellow">All of a sudden, I wanted to go to work today.</font>

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,000
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel out of the loop...</font>

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,770
<font color="yellow">in this busy world?</font>

15
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,270
<font color="yellow">Among so many offices in those tall buildings,</font>

16
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,600
<font color="yellow">don't you wonder why you aren't working in one of them?</font>

17
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,070
<font color="yellow">You want to participate no matter what.</font>

18
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,240
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel a strong desire to join the workforce?</font>

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,070
<font color="yellow">Have you read my mind?</font>

20
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,570
<font color="yellow">- Who am I again?
- A job seeker.</font>

21
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,040
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- A job seeker.</font>

22
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,040
<font color="yellow">This is what job seekers do.</font>

23
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,770
<font color="yellow">Not only do they study, but they also contemplate.</font>

24
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,500
<font color="yellow">The more you study,</font>

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,040
<font color="yellow">the deeper your thoughts get.</font>

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,270
<font color="yellow">You're starting to mature.</font>

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,340
<font color="yellow">You still have a long way to go to be as mature as I am.</font>

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,740
<font color="yellow">Let's finish shopping.</font>

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,940
<font color="yellow">Then look for Bok Nam.</font>

30
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,600
<font color="yellow">- All right.
- Good.</font>

31
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,640
<font color="yellow">Awesome.</font>

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,970
<font color="yellow">I want to become a better person.</font>

33
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,810
<font color="yellow">After that, I'll tell her.</font>

35
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,400
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,770
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil moved in with Mr Cha.</font>

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,970
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,770
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

39
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Mr Cha has a crush on Bok Sil.</font>

40
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,070
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, why would he take her to his place...</font>

41
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,000
<font color="yellow">when she's burdened by someone?</font>

42
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,770
<font color="yellow">There's a boy named Louis that Bok Sil is taking care of.</font>

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,270
<font color="yellow">He's very friendly,</font>

44
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,070
<font color="yellow">but he is...</font>

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,240
<font color="yellow">He's very strange like an alien. He's a burden on her.</font>

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,070
<font color="yellow">- I see.
- Yes.</font>

47
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,700
<font color="yellow">It's a pity that you didn't get to see Bok Sil.</font>

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,900
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

49
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,700
<font color="yellow">I only came by as her boss because I was worried about her.</font>

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,300
<font color="yellow">I know I shouldn't say this when we've just met.</font>

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,770
<font color="yellow">Your face, your body... I mean, you have...</font>

52
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,370
<font color="yellow">such a kind heart.</font>

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,870
<font color="yellow">I'm flattered.</font>

54
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,100
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

55
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,900
<font color="yellow">On top of that, you're modest.</font>

56
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's hot.</font>

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,070
<font color="yellow">Dad, Louis is living with Mr Cha.</font>

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,740
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- It's so annoying!</font>

59
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,370
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil is also living with him.</font>

60
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,840
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make her move out.</font>

61
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,540
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri, calm down.</font>

62
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,200
<font color="yellow">Leave it up to me.</font>

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,270
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

64
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,970
<font color="yellow">Who's here at this late hour?</font>

65
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,800
<font color="yellow">It's past 11pm.</font>

66
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,900
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek?</font>

67
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,900
<font color="yellow">What? Mr Baek?</font>

68
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,340
<font color="yellow">Why is Mr Baek here?</font>

69
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,400
<font color="yellow">Hide in the study for now. Hurry.</font>

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
<font color="yellow">My shoes.</font>

71
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,900
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

72
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,800
<font color="yellow">- Hold these.
- Mr Baek.</font>

73
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,640
<font color="yellow">Why brings you here?</font>

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for coming so late.</font>

75
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,940
<font color="yellow">I have something urgent to tell you, so I stopped by.</font>

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
<font color="yellow">- Let's talk inside.
- Wait.</font>

77
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,570
<font color="yellow">Is Mr Cha at a high position in the company for Mr Baek to...</font>

78
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,800
<font color="yellow">Be quiet!</font>

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,100
<font color="yellow">Is someone there inside?</font>

80
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,300
<font color="yellow">No way. You know I live alone.</font>

81
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,940
<font color="yellow">I think there's someone in the room.</font>

82
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,000
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek.</font>

83
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,870
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek!</font>

84
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,840
<font color="yellow">I know you're the president,</font>

85
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,670
<font color="yellow">but I don't think it's appropriate for you to act like this.</font>

86
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

87
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,770
<font color="yellow">I guess I became sensitive after hearing some rumours.</font>

88
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,970
<font color="yellow">Do you sleep in the study?</font>

89
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,600
<font color="yellow">Yes, I work and sleep here sometimes.</font>

90
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,070
<font color="yellow">I see. Let's talk here.</font>

91
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,540
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

92
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,070
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

93
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,770
<font color="yellow">I heard something strange about you today.</font>

94
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,500
<font color="yellow">About me?</font>

95
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,700
<font color="yellow">I heard you're living with a female employee from your department.</font>

96
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

97
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,700
<font color="yellow">On top of that,</font>

98
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,870
<font color="yellow">I heard she's the cleaner whom you hired...</font>

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,070
<font color="yellow">a month ago.</font>

100
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,840
<font color="yellow">I couldn't believe what they were saying, so I threw a fit.</font>

101
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,770
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't do something like that.</font>

102
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,940
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't do that because of a girl.</font>

103
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,470
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't hire people for ulterior motives.</font>

104
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,200
<font color="yellow">Would you, Mr Cha?</font>

105
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,800
<font color="yellow">I've mentioned this before.</font>

106
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,200
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil will make a great merchandiser.</font>

107
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,700
<font color="yellow">That's why I gave her a chance.</font>

108
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,500
<font color="yellow">She took the chance and was hired as a temporary worker.</font>

109
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,570
<font color="yellow">She earned it with her effort.</font>

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,740
<font color="yellow">Don't criticise me and say that I had ulterior motives.</font>

111
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,900
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

112
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,640
<font color="yellow">You're the most trustworthy person in the world.</font>

113
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,170
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

114
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,500
<font color="yellow">such rumours won't benefit you at all.</font>

115
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,100
<font color="yellow">It will be bad for your upright and proud image.</font>

116
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,270
<font color="yellow">I don't want that.</font>

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,470
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your concern.</font>

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,940
<font color="yellow">What do you think about...</font>

119
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,540
<font color="yellow">sending Bok Sil to our branch in Shanghai?</font>

120
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

121
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
<font color="yellow">Give it some thought.</font>

122
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,740
<font color="yellow">It can be a good opportunity for her.</font>

123
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,870
<font color="yellow">Forgive me for intruding at this hour.</font>

124
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
<font color="yellow">- Stay here. I'll go.
- Goodbye, Sir.</font>

125
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,100
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha. I'm sorry.</font>

126
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
<font color="yellow">I was selfish to only look out for ourselves.</font>

127
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,370
<font color="yellow">I didn't know it would cause you trouble.</font>

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,640
<font color="yellow">If Bok Sil is sorry, I'm sorry as well.</font>

129
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,170
<font color="yellow">- Go and pack your things.
- Okay.</font>

130
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,210
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

131
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,570
<font color="yellow">I don't know who spread a ridiculous rumour,</font>

132
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,870
<font color="yellow">but I'm fine.</font>

133
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,570
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with living with you two.</font>

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,000
<font color="yellow">I'm the owner and I say it's fine.</font>

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,340
<font color="yellow">Don't be dramatic and go to sleep.</font>

136
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,370
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha. I still think...</font>

137
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,970
<font color="yellow">- we should...
- Thank you for letting us stay.</font>

138
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,970
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

139
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,100
<font color="yellow">You should gladly accept someone's kindness.</font>

140
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,240
<font color="yellow">That's the courtesy.</font>

141
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,600
<font color="yellow">Am I right, Mr Cha?</font>

142
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,500
<font color="yellow">It's not like you to say something right.</font>

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,570
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha.</font>

144
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,370
<font color="yellow">You don't like Bok Sil as a woman, do you?</font>

145
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,440
<font color="yellow">That's ridiculous.</font>

146
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,370
<font color="yellow">It's what the president said.</font>

147
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,210
<font color="yellow">It's not true, is it?</font>

148
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,070
<font color="yellow">- Of course not.
- Thank goodness.</font>

149
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,940
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

150
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,670
<font color="yellow">really going to send Bok Sil to the Shanghai branch?</font>

151
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,270
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

152
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,100
<font color="yellow">Don't worry yourselves needlessly and just go to sleep.</font>

153
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,170
<font color="yellow">Go upstairs.</font>

154
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,840
<font color="yellow">Should I spread the word that I live here as well?</font>

155
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,800
<font color="yellow">Just go upstairs.</font>

156
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,440
<font color="yellow">If Bok Sil is sent to the Shanghai branch, Louis will go with her.</font>

157
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,770
<font color="yellow">All we have to do is make sure Louis doesn't show up...</font>

158
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,470
<font color="yellow">until the company shares are settled.</font>

159
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,770
<font color="yellow">Louis doesn't even have an ID. How will you send him to China?</font>

160
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,640
<font color="yellow">I will take care of that matter.</font>

161
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,940
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil wouldn't want to go, either.</font>

162
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,170
<font color="yellow">She's pulling out all the stops to find her brother.</font>

163
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,940
<font color="yellow">You said he already died.</font>

164
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,570
<font color="yellow">You should tell Bok Sil that her brother is dead.</font>

165
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,240
<font color="yellow">When she hears it, she'd want to go somewhere far.</font>

166
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,840
<font color="yellow">That will be the perfect motive for her to leave.</font>

167
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,270
<font color="yellow">You should hurry.</font>

168
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,000
<font color="yellow">Are you sure he bought a flower here?</font>

169
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,540
<font color="yellow">Yes. He was so picky about choosing the flower.</font>

170
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,140
<font color="yellow">- So, which one did he pick?
- An orange-coloured rose.</font>

171
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,170
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim. Do you know well about the flower language?</font>

172
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,900
<font color="yellow">Red means passion, yellow means jealousy and pink means happiness.</font>

173
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,740
<font color="yellow">- Do you know what orange means?
- I don't know.</font>

174
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,140
<font color="yellow">It means first love.</font>

175
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,870
<font color="yellow">Have you ever been in love?</font>

176
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,640
<font color="yellow">Mr Louis. You shouldn't ask that kind of a question so bluntly.</font>

177
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,200
<font color="yellow">That can be rude.</font>

178
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,570
<font color="yellow">We're close enough to talk about it.</font>

179
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,040
<font color="yellow">Would I be in love someday?</font>

180
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
<font color="yellow">You'll have to see.</font>

181
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,970
<font color="yellow">If I fall in love with someone,</font>

182
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,040
<font color="yellow">I'll give her this orange rose. Just a single rose.</font>

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,970
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with you?
- It must be Mr Louis.</font>

184
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,240
<font color="yellow">Did he say anything else?</font>

185
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,600
<font color="yellow">He said he will give that flower to the woman he lives with.</font>

186
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,640
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

187
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,500
<font color="yellow">I don't think they were married, but just living together.</font>

188
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,370
<font color="yellow">- That's how he sounded like.
- He can't be living with someone.</font>

189
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,740
<font color="yellow">I remember him distinctly because he paid with coins only.</font>

190
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,370
<font color="yellow">That doesn't sound like Mr Louis, either. It can't be him.</font>

191
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Sure.</font>

192
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,840
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it's him.</font>

193
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,100
<font color="yellow">Here, 1 for a dollar, 2 for 2 dollars.</font>

194
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,940
<font color="yellow">Grab anything you want.</font>

195
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,500
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

196
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,300
<font color="yellow">In Sung. What do you think?</font>

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,570
<font color="yellow">You have such a good taste.</font>

198
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,870
<font color="yellow">I'm just so curious.</font>

199
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,040
<font color="yellow">- Did it talk to you again?
- Yes.</font>

200
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,300
<font color="yellow">- What did it say?
- "Louis". It calls my name.</font>

201
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,840
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

202
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,100
<font color="yellow">I think you're mentally ill.</font>

203
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,540
<font color="yellow">You're a long way off becoming as good as me.</font>

204
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,000
<font color="yellow">- I'll take this.
- Okay.</font>

205
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Please come again.</font>

206
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,140
<font color="yellow">- Could you put this in a bag?
- Sure.</font>

207
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,170
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

208
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,340
<font color="yellow">Please come again.</font>

209
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,800
<font color="yellow">- Is the criminal caught yet?
- No.</font>

210
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,170
<font color="yellow">That's strange. I gave them a big hint. He should be caught by now.</font>

211
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,600
<font color="yellow">I wrote a letter to the United Nation.</font>

212
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,200
<font color="yellow">Korea will be reunified soon. You'll see.</font>

213
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,600
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- It sounds absurd, right?</font>

214
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,440
<font color="yellow">You sound absurd, too.</font>

215
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,100
<font color="yellow">Okay. I got it.</font>

216
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,340
<font color="yellow">Sir. We have the address of Jung Gil Do, the suspect.</font>

217
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,040
<font color="yellow">Good. Let's go then.</font>

218
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,100
<font color="yellow">He might run away,</font>

219
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,040
<font color="yellow">- so guard his house well.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

220
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Hurry up.</font>

221
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,400
<font color="yellow">You punks! Move it fast. Let's go.</font>

222
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,770
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil.</font>

223
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ms Baek.</font>

224
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,300
<font color="yellow">- Can I talk to you after work?
- Okay.</font>

225
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,370
<font color="yellow">Have you got the list of the stores for Korea Black Friday?</font>

226
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,300
<font color="yellow">Is it going well for each category?</font>

227
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,740
<font color="yellow">Of course. A lot of enterprises are willing to sell their products.</font>

228
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,840
<font color="yellow">See? There is an enormous amount of sample products.</font>

229
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,100
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see that.</font>

230
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,070
<font color="yellow">- Tidy them up now.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

231
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,000
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee. Did you hire a temporary part-time worker?</font>

232
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,440
<font color="yellow">He will start working from today.</font>

233
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,070
<font color="yellow">- Bok Sil went to pick him up.
- I see.</font>

234
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,070
<font color="yellow">- Why are you alone?
- The part-timer had an emergency.</font>

235
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,940
<font color="yellow">- He's sorry, but he can't come.
- What?</font>

236
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,570
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee, you're so great at recruitment.</font>

237
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,740
<font color="yellow">How can you be so great at everything?</font>

238
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,570
<font color="yellow">- I'll find another...
- Forget it.</font>

239
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,970
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,170
<font color="yellow">I'll get someone.</font>

241
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,440
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Let's move them.</font>

242
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,570
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I said I'm sure.</font>

243
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,200
<font color="yellow">He's a regular customer here.</font>

244
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,340
<font color="yellow">He pays with 50 cent coins only. It's hard not to remember him.</font>

245
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,500
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't he be some kind of a beggar?</font>

246
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,640
<font color="yellow">He must beg for coins and spend them.</font>

247
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,070
<font color="yellow">He came here a while ago and bought a t-shirt.</font>

248
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,800
<font color="yellow">That's why I left a comment on your post.</font>

249
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,600
<font color="yellow">A while ago? When?</font>

250
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,800
<font color="yellow">It was about 20 minutes ago.</font>

251
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,370
<font color="yellow">- 20 minutes?
- Yes.</font>

252
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,070
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Please call me if he comes again.</font>

253
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,870
<font color="yellow">- Please.
- Please.</font>

254
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,470
<font color="yellow">- Look at that.
- Hurry up.</font>

255
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,300
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Oh, dear.</font>

256
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,040
<font color="yellow">- Let's take a look at that.
- Sure.</font>

257
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,670
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Gosh.</font>

258
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,700
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my. Are you okay?
- Sorry.</font>

259
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,400
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Mister!</font>

260
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,040
<font color="yellow">You should watch where you're going.</font>

261
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,870
<font color="yellow">He could've gotten hurt.</font>

262
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,440
<font color="yellow">Give me your phone number.</font>

263
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,840
<font color="yellow">- Mister!
- Ms Heo.</font>

264
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,370
<font color="yellow">- I'm fine, so stop.
- But I'm not fine.</font>

265
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,240
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't hurt your back.</font>

266
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,600
<font color="yellow">Her pupils are shaking and her lips are sticking out.</font>

267
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,900
<font color="yellow">She's truly worried about me.</font>

268
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,370
<font color="yellow">- Are you really okay?
- Why?</font>

269
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,900
<font color="yellow">Why would she be?</font>

270
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,440
<font color="yellow">It's really delicious.</font>

271
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,340
<font color="yellow">Hello? Gosh, really?</font>

272
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,240
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

273
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,800
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- I got a job.</font>

274
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,200
<font color="yellow">- I'll get 50 dollars per day.
- Great!</font>

275
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,410
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- At Goldline.</font>

276
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,910
<font color="yellow">50 dollars?</font>

277
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

278
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,910
<font color="yellow">Goldline is that way.</font>

279
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,340
<font color="yellow">I need to get something. See you later.</font>

280
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,700
<font color="yellow">What is he going to buy again?</font>

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,240
<font color="yellow">Why can't he start work without his things?</font>

282
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,940
<font color="yellow">Wow, 50 dollars is a lot.</font>

283
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,270
<font color="yellow">Perfect.</font>

284
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,700
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

285
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,800
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

286
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,600
<font color="yellow">Where is Mr Cha?</font>

287
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,740
<font color="yellow">He's out for lunch.</font>

288
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,800
<font color="yellow">How about Bok Sil?</font>

289
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,170
<font color="yellow">- Do you know her?
- Yes, I'm close to her.</font>

290
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,340
<font color="yellow">Did they go out for lunch together?</font>

291
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,410
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure about that.</font>

292
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's annoying.</font>

293
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,800
<font color="yellow">I'd like a cup of Maxim Gold.</font>

294
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

295
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,540
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

296
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,670
<font color="yellow">He seems so familiar.</font>

297
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,940
<font color="yellow">All of his clothes, shoes and scarf belong to Mr Cha.</font>

298
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,040
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

299
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,070
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha, someone is here for you.</font>

300
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,170
<font color="yellow">That rascal.</font>

301
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind? Who told you to wear my clothes?</font>

302
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,570
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

303
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,340
<font color="yellow">He'll be working part-time today to help out with the chores.</font>

304
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,970
<font color="yellow">- Say hello.
- Hello.</font>

305
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,300
<font color="yellow">- His name is...
- Louis.</font>

306
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,270
<font color="yellow">Do you mean Louis from Louis XIV?</font>

307
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,700
<font color="yellow">You don't have a last name?</font>

308
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,700
<font color="yellow">Well, it's...</font>

309
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,410
<font color="yellow">King.</font>

310
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,370
<font color="yellow">- King Louis.
- King?</font>

311
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,770
<font color="yellow">- Bok Sil.
- Ms Park.</font>

312
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,870
<font color="yellow">- Who is this?
- I'm her guardian.</font>

313
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,870
<font color="yellow">Right, he's Bok Sil's boyfriend.</font>

314
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,440
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Louis?</font>

315
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,270
<font color="yellow">No, he's not.</font>

316
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,470
<font color="yellow">I'm more than her boyfriend.</font>

317
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,670
<font color="yellow">We live...</font>

318
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,800
<font color="yellow">We're looking for someone.</font>

319
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,140
<font color="yellow">He's helping me find my brother.</font>

320
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,870
<font color="yellow">Why are you wearing Mr Cha's clothes?</font>

321
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,910
<font color="yellow">We live...</font>

322
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,970
<font color="yellow">We met while being on a diet.</font>

323
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,540
<font color="yellow">You lost a lot of weight.</font>

324
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,540
<font color="yellow">Get to work now.</font>

325
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,170
<font color="yellow">There's so much piled up in front of the storeroom!</font>

326
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,470
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

327
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,570
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- Goodness.</font>

328
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,910
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

329
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you. What's your name?</font>

330
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,410
<font color="yellow">Lee Kyung Kook.</font>

331
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,100
<font color="yellow">I'll remember that name.</font>

332
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

333
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,440
<font color="yellow">He's a part-timer.</font>

334
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,840
<font color="yellow">(A PART-TIMER)</font>

335
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,600
<font color="yellow">He made coffee for a part-timer. Good job, Mr Lee.</font>

336
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,070
<font color="yellow">How did you meet Bok Sil?</font>

337
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,500
<font color="yellow">How did you find this job?</font>

338
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,800
<font color="yellow">What do you do?</font>

339
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,400
<font color="yellow">Which gym does Mr Cha go to?</font>

340
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,870
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about the part-timer. Get to work.</font>

341
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,700
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Mr Lee?</font>

342
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,740
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

343
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,540
<font color="yellow">Open the boxes and check the items.</font>

344
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,340
<font color="yellow">Separate the items...</font>

345
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,570
<font color="yellow">per category and bring them to each person in charge.</font>

346
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,570
<font color="yellow">That's not so hard.</font>

349
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,170
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

350
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,940
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

351
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,170
<font color="yellow">Dad, we're in trouble.</font>

352
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,300
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri.</font>

353
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,500
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

354
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,470
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

355
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,670
<font color="yellow">Let's discuss it later.</font>

356
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,070
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

357
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,600
<font color="yellow">Dad, Dad.</font>

358
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,970
<font color="yellow">Louis came to the office.</font>

359
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,870
<font color="yellow">He's at merchandising department right now.</font>

360
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,900
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

361
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,740
<font color="yellow">Why did he come to merchandising department?</font>

362
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,040
<font color="yellow">Did you find out why he came?</font>

363
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,470
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a chance to find out. I ran here as soon as I saw him.</font>

364
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,070
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

365
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,470
<font color="yellow">Is he here for the part-time job?</font>

366
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,370
<font color="yellow">Part-time job?</font>

367
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,070
<font color="yellow">We have so much work because of the Black Friday event.</font>

368
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,800
<font color="yellow">We hired a part-timer.</font>

369
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,400
<font color="yellow">Since Bok Sil is working here,</font>

370
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,170
<font color="yellow">Louis keeps getting involved.</font>

371
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,270
<font color="yellow">We need to get rid of her now.</font>

372
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,470
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

373
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,900
<font color="yellow">- This is missing, right?
- Yes.</font>

374
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,940
<font color="yellow">What happened here?</font>

375
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,040
<font color="yellow">Louis.</font>

376
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,200
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

377
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

378
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,370
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

379
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,200
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

380
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,240
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm not okay.</font>

381
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,270
<font color="yellow">Some woman attacked me.</font>

382
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,870
<font color="yellow">She's not here.</font>

383
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,940
<font color="yellow">That woman...</font>

384
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,770
<font color="yellow">pushed all these boxes on me as soon as she saw me.</font>

385
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,570
<font color="yellow">Mi Young?</font>

386
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,640
<font color="yellow">If it's not Hae Joo either...</font>

387
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,540
<font color="yellow">Is it Ms Baek?</font>

388
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,100
<font color="yellow">Come on, that's nonsense.</font>

389
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,040
<font color="yellow">Who do you think she is?</font>

390
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,240
<font color="yellow">I know, I've seen her somewhere.</font>

391
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,400
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

392
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,700
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

393
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,700
<font color="yellow">I was run over by her car.</font>

394
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,670
<font color="yellow">After running me over,</font>

395
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,570
<font color="yellow">she gave me money and called me.</font>

396
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,470
<font color="yellow">Are you saying the woman who pushed the boxes on you...</font>

397
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,800
<font color="yellow">is the same woman who hit you with her car?</font>

398
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,700
<font color="yellow">That's so strange.</font>

399
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,900
<font color="yellow">He looks normal, but he's a bit strange.</font>

400
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,470
<font color="yellow">- He's delusional.
- Right.</font>

401
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,070
<font color="yellow">I was jealous of Bok Sil for having a handsome boyfriend.</font>

402
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,040
<font color="yellow">It turns out he's a little iffy.</font>

403
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,870
<font color="yellow">But he's so familiar.</font>

404
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,540
<font color="yellow">King Louis. Have I seen him somewhere?</font>

405
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,540
<font color="yellow">- Have you seen me before?
- Goodness.</font>

406
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,300
<font color="yellow">When? Where?</font>

407
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,870
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

408
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,100
<font color="yellow">- Hurry.
- Hurry what?</font>

409
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,470
<font color="yellow">- What's that smell?
- Something smells bad.</font>

410
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,840
<font color="yellow">- That homeless man?
- That pervert?</font>

411
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,000
<font color="yellow">- That hurt.
- Is he a homeless?</font>

412
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

413
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,600
<font color="yellow">Did Bok Sil meet him in the lobby when she used to be a cleaner?</font>

414
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,100
<font color="yellow">It's a meeting of a cleaner and a homeless man...</font>

415
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,470
<font color="yellow">by fate.</font>

416
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,070
<font color="yellow">What a tragic story.</font>

417
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,370
<font color="yellow">Poor Bok Sil.</font>

418
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,040
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

419
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,540
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

420
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,570
<font color="yellow">What happened here?</font>

421
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,970
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, I got hit in the face.</font>

422
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,200
<font color="yellow">Who hit you?</font>

423
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,740
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

424
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,040
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you should have been more careful.</font>

425
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,500
<font color="yellow">That must hurt.</font>

426
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,300
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. Isn't it strange?</font>

427
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,470
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who believes what I say.</font>

428
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,170
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha also says I'm a big liar.</font>

429
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,840
<font color="yellow">You only need one person who will believe...</font>

430
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,700
<font color="yellow">what you say.</font>

431
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,340
<font color="yellow">- Is that person you?
- Of course.</font>

432
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,840
<font color="yellow">Ms Baek. Did you...</font>

433
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,170
<font color="yellow">hit Louis with your car?</font>

434
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,300
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

435
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,940
<font color="yellow">Did you say Louis?</font>

436
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,270
<font color="yellow">Haven't you seen the new part-timer?</font>

437
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,170
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't.</font>

438
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,640
<font color="yellow">I knew it. He's just crazy.</font>

439
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,570
<font color="yellow">Hae Joo said he is Bok Sil's boyfriend.</font>

440
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,740
<font color="yellow">- Is Bok Sil into appearances?
- She's more like a philanthropist.</font>

441
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,970
<font color="yellow">- We'll go into a meeting now.
- Okay.</font>

442
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,870
<font color="yellow">Put it over there. Good.</font>

443
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,500
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

444
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,170
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to avoid someone?</font>

445
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,640
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

446
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,170
<font color="yellow">The suspect got caught. Let's go to the police office.</font>

447
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,700
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Let's go.</font>

448
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,540
<font color="yellow">- How did it happen?
- Let's hurry.</font>

449
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,000
<font color="yellow">- Did they catch the suspect?
- They did.</font>

450
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,540
<font color="yellow">That's strange. I gave them a big hint. He should be caught by now.</font>

451
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh. He's good at taking guesses.</font>

452
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,700
<font color="yellow">It gives me the chills.</font>

453
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,600
<font color="yellow">Jung Gil Do, the suspect of the serial murder case...</font>

454
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,470
<font color="yellow">- in Eunsung-dong got caught.
- What was your...</font>

455
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,740
<font color="yellow">- motive for your murder?
- He had never left any evidence,</font>

456
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,070
<font color="yellow">but he failed to see the unidentified powder...</font>

457
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,400
<font color="yellow">on the floor of the house he committed the third murder.</font>

458
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,300
<font color="yellow">Why was there powder on the floor? Bok Sil keeps it very neat.</font>

459
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,340
<font color="yellow">His footprints became...</font>

- I wonder who he is.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why isn't Bok Sil home yet?</font>

463
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,670

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,170

467
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,140
<font color="yellow">It's so hard to have a cup of coffee.</font>

468
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,700

<font color="yellow">(5 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT)</font>

470
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,000
<font color="yellow">What is all this?</font>

471
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,540
<font color="yellow">Sir. Shouldn't we give Louis a reward?</font>

472
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,140
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a report on the suspect.</font>

473
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,440
<font color="yellow">Still.</font>

474
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,200
<font color="yellow">We caught the suspect faster because he told us about the footprints.</font>

475
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,840
<font color="yellow">He's right. If we hadn't looked into on the cycling shoes stores,</font>

476
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,170
<font color="yellow">- we wouldn't have caught him.
- You little...</font>

477
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,140
<font color="yellow">He will smack you.</font>

478
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,470
<font color="yellow">We can't give him 100 percent of the reward.</font>

479
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,800
<font color="yellow">Check if we can give him a part of it.</font>

480
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,940
<font color="yellow">When the inspection is over,</font>

481
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,170
<font color="yellow">- take off the police line.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

482
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,800
<font color="yellow">Is the victim at the hospital still unconscious?</font>

483
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,040
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's probably a burglar.</font>

484
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,740
<font color="yellow">- Should I continue investigating?
- You should.</font>

485
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,040
<font color="yellow">I told you I left that comment by mistake.</font>

486
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,640
<font color="yellow">I just took him for someone else.</font>

487
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,700
<font color="yellow">That's why I deleted the comment.</font>

488
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,540
<font color="yellow">Wait. Please take a look at this again.</font>

489
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,670
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. I'm busy.</font>

490
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,500
<font color="yellow">- But...
- Wait.</font>

491
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,340
<font color="yellow">You won't receive any more reports? Why?</font>

492
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,540
<font color="yellow">- I got a call from his guardian.
- His guardian?</font>

493
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,270
<font color="yellow">She said her son has a mental deficiency,</font>

494
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,370
<font color="yellow">and she doesn't want him to go on TV shows.</font>

495
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,540
<font color="yellow">I understand his parents feel that way.</font>

496
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,700
<font color="yellow">We took down the pictures and the video.</font>

497
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,100
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I know that man.</font>

498
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,740
<font color="yellow">Stop it. He just said that man has parents.</font>

499
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's just someone who looks a lot like Mr Louis.</font>

500
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,040
<font color="yellow">Besides, how can a dead person come back to life?</font>

501
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,100
<font color="yellow">Can I get his contact number?</font>

502
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,070
<font color="yellow">- We don't know that. Excuse me.
- Wait.</font>

503
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,270
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek. It's me.</font>

504
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,640
<font color="yellow">We went to the hospital and the broadcasting station.</font>

505
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,940
<font color="yellow">That man is not Mr Louis.</font>

506
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,000
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir.</font>

507
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,070
<font color="yellow">Who were you talking to?</font>

508
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,310
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't want to see me. What changed your mind?</font>

509
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,040
<font color="yellow">- How is Mother?
- Mother?</font>

510
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,400
<font color="yellow">She's asleep now. Why?</font>

511
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,240
<font color="yellow">Bring her to Seoul.</font>

512
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,640
<font color="yellow">Is it... Is it because you found Louis?</font>

513
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,070
<font color="yellow">No. It's not that.</font>

514
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything silly to Mother.</font>

515
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,700
<font color="yellow">Just bring her here.</font>

516
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
<font color="yellow">I won't forgive you if you say something silly again.</font>

517
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,570
<font color="yellow">Who is the person you keep talking to?</font>

518
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,070
<font color="yellow">It's just my friend.</font>

519
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,700
<font color="yellow">You're lying.</font>

520
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,870
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you again. Is there anyone you have to make reports to?</font>

521
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,840
<font color="yellow">Why do you care whom I talk to?</font>

522
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,870
<font color="yellow">Why are you ordering me around? I can't believe this.</font>

523
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,700
<font color="yellow">Why is she lying to me?</font>

524
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,370
<font color="yellow">Was she talking to her boyfriend?</font>

525
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what am I thinking? Wait for me.</font>

526
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that restaurant makes the best pasta.</font>

527
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,940
<font color="yellow">I was so happy when I was eating their pasta,</font>

528
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,400
<font color="yellow">but now I'm sad to work overtime.</font>

529
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,200
<font color="yellow">Is Ms Baek working outside the office today? I haven't seen her.</font>

530
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,040
<font color="yellow">She is not avoiding Louis, is she?</font>

531
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,940
<font color="yellow">You're driving me crazy, Mr Lee.</font>

532
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,740
<font color="yellow">Why do you always say crazy things?</font>

533
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,500
<font color="yellow">You do it all the time. It's annoying.</font>

534
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,170
<font color="yellow">- Did Bok Sil and Louis leave?
- What?</font>

535
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,740
<font color="yellow">Two stars for Park Hae Joo.</font>

536
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,340
<font color="yellow">You talk too much. You're so noisy. From Louis.</font>

537
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,700
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

538
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,500
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he's making me laugh.</font>

539
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,700
<font color="yellow">How many stars did you get?</font>

540
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,240
<font color="yellow">One star for Kwon Mi Young.</font>

541
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,310
<font color="yellow">You look down on me. From Louis.</font>

542
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,070
<font color="yellow">Just 1? I got 3 stars.</font>

543
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,640
<font color="yellow">Three stars for Byun Do Jin.</font>

544
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,240
<font color="yellow">I only like your style. From Louis.</font>

545
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,270
<font color="yellow">I got five.</font>

546
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,240
<font color="yellow">Five stars for Lee Kyung Kook. You're kind.</font>

547
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,100
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the coffee. From Louis.</font>

548
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you making a fuss about this? He's only a part-timer.</font>

549
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,170
<font color="yellow">I know, but isn't this annoying?</font>

550
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,600
<font color="yellow">His spelling is all wrong. How dare he judge us?</font>

551
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,240
<font color="yellow">He's a good judge of character.</font>

552
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,970
<font color="yellow">He wants us to put up the products he stuck post-its on.</font>

553
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,540
<font color="yellow">He says they have a competitive quality.</font>

554
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,640
<font color="yellow">Who does he think he is to evaluate the products?</font>

555
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,740
<font color="yellow">What a joke.</font>

556
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,440
<font color="yellow">He may actually be an expert in this field.</font>

557
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,740
<font color="yellow">There's something special about him.</font>

558
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,370
<font color="yellow">Where is Louis?</font>

559
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,070
<font color="yellow">Did he finish all of his tasks?</font>

560
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,340
<font color="yellow">Yes, he completed everything.</font>

561
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,670
<font color="yellow">Get back to your work!</font>

562
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,900
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, why did you lie to me?</font>

563
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,200
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me?
- Is Mr Cha your neighbour?</font>

564
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,470
<font color="yellow">How can you fool me like that?</font>

565
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,370
<font color="yellow">You're acting suspiciously.</font>

566
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I lied.</font>

567
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,040
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to put Mr Cha in an awkward position.</font>

568
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,840
<font color="yellow">Right, so why did you start it to begin with?</font>

569
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,310
<font color="yellow">I heard that you moved into his place with a guy.</font>

570
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,840
<font color="yellow">You don't need to hide it from me. I already know everything.</font>

571
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,040
<font color="yellow">Could you please not tell other people?</font>

572
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,700
<font color="yellow">I was actually going to move out today anyway.</font>

573
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,270
<font color="yellow">You have to move out.</font>

574
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,600
<font color="yellow">Stop inconveniencing other people.</font>

575
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,940
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

576
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

577
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,470
<font color="yellow">I actually asked you to meet me today to talk about something else.</font>

578
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,140
<font color="yellow">What is it? Is it something important?</font>

579
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,370
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil. I'm going to tell you something, but don't be surprised.</font>

580
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,540
<font color="yellow">Actually...</font>

581
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,770
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil!</font>

582
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,240
<font color="yellow">Louis?</font>

583
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,140
<font color="yellow">Go. Yes, just go.</font>

584
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,940
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, let's talk some other time.</font>

585
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,970
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

586
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,840
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

587
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,940
<font color="yellow">Ms Baek.</font>

588
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,240
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms Baek.</font>

589
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,270
<font color="yellow">- Do you need a hand?
- No! Don't come near me.</font>

590
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,570
<font color="yellow">You two should just leave.</font>

591
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,870
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

592
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,500
<font color="yellow">Your voice sounds familiar.</font>

593
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,340
<font color="yellow">My gosh!</font>

594
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,870
<font color="yellow">She's taking the tray with her.</font>

595
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,500
<font color="yellow">Miss! You can't take the tray!</font>

596
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,940
<font color="yellow">It's not really a covetable item, don't you think?</font>

597
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,440
<font color="yellow">Miss! Stop, you thief!</font>

598
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,470
<font color="yellow">How dare you accuse me of stealing this tray!</font>

599
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,870
<font color="yellow">You'll be so surprised if you find out who I am,</font>

600
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,270
<font color="yellow">so just take this and go.</font>

601
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,500
<font color="yellow">Why do I keep seeing Louis everywhere I go?</font>

602
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what should I do?</font>

603
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,000
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, I am so sorry.</font>

604
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,000
<font color="yellow">I was convinced that he was Mr Louis.</font>

605
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,870
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, I apologise.</font>

606
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,740
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

607
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,270
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim and Ms Heo, thank you very much for trying.</font>

608
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mother.</font>

609
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,670
<font color="yellow">I caused a fuss and turned it into a big deal.</font>

610
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,940
<font color="yellow">No, don't worry.</font>

611
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,040
<font color="yellow">Thanks for looking after me.</font>

612
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,100
<font color="yellow">Where is Seon Goo? Why isn't he here yet?</font>

613
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,540
<font color="yellow">And what's taking Ma Ri so long?</font>

614
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,570
<font color="yellow">They're coming together now.</font>

615
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,240
<font color="yellow">Why do we have to go to Grandma's house?</font>

616
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,900
<font color="yellow">Grandma is in Seoul now. Let's go say hello.</font>

617
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,810
<font color="yellow">- Is something going on?
- The shares need to be finalised.</font>

618
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,040
<font color="yellow">We're meeting the attorney, Mr Hwang, tomorrow.</font>

619
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,900
<font color="yellow">Dad, can we really leave Louis like that?</font>

620
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,400
<font color="yellow">How many times have I told you? I'll take care of everything.</font>

621
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,500
<font color="yellow">Pretend not to know anything in front of Grandma.</font>

622
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,200
<font color="yellow">- Got it?
- Okay.</font>

623
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,310
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy to get the reward?</font>

624
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,600
<font color="yellow">Of course! I have money rolling in from various sources today.</font>

625
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,570
<font color="yellow">Buy Bok Sil delicious food with this money.</font>

626
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,040
<font color="yellow">I'm going to spend it all for her.</font>

627
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,970
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

628
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,040
<font color="yellow">Detective Nam called me and told me that the suspect has been caught.</font>

629
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,070
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

630
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,540
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

631
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,540
<font color="yellow">I'll move back home. Thank you for letting me stay here.</font>

632
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,000
<font color="yellow">You can stay here if you find that rooftop room uncomfortable.</font>

633
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,940
<font color="yellow">I have extra rooms anyway.</font>

634
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,140
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much, but it's all right.</font>

635
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,810
<font color="yellow">Also, I won't go to the branch in Shanghai.</font>

636
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,970
<font color="yellow">I have to find my brother and help Louis get his memory back,</font>

637
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,270
<font color="yellow">so I must stay in Seoul.</font>

638
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,770

<font color="yellow">send you there, either.</font>

640
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,700
<font color="yellow">You still have a lot to learn.</font>

641
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,500
<font color="yellow">You cannot escape my training programme.</font>

642
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,040
<font color="yellow">Never, never, never.</font>

643
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,340
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

644
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,540
<font color="yellow">Don't get distracted and focus on work. Understood?</font>

645

- Hey, Bok Sil.</font>

656
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,440
<font color="yellow">- Oh my gosh!
- You're here, too.</font>

657
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,740
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. You must be exhausted.</font>

658
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,740
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to clean my place for me.</font>

659
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:08,140
<font color="yellow">I'm an expert in this, you know. You two should wait outside.</font>

660
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,270
<font color="yellow">I just have to wipe this spot here.</font>

661
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,200
<font color="yellow">Nothing feels nicer...</font>

663

667
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,970

668
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,400

670
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,170

- You come here.</font>

671
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,740

675
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,600
<font color="yellow">What food?</font>

676
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,000
<font color="yellow">I hope you enjoy it, Sir.</font>

677
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,900
<font color="yellow">See you again, Mr Cha Joong On.</font>

678
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,470

<font color="yellow">Mum, come join us. Sit here.</font>

686
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,300
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's eat.</font>

687
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,840
<font color="yellow">Bok Sil, tell me if there's anything else you crave. I'll buy it for you.</font>

688
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,570
<font color="yellow">This is more than enough. Stop ordering food.</font>

689
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,100
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

690
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,300
<font color="yellow">That clueless guy is slowly starting to grow up.</font>

691
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,140
<font color="yellow">I really can't believe this.</font>

692
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,470
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm a competent person.</font>

693
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,840
<font color="yellow">I can't be called the clueless guy forever.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm King of Shopping, Louis.</font>

695
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,570
<font color="yellow">Only those who are incompetent brag about themselves like that.</font>

696
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, eat before it gets cold.</font>

697
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,300
<font color="yellow">I hope you all enjoy the food!</font>

698
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,470
<font color="yellow">- We will!
- Thanks!</font>

699

<font color="yellow">Jo In Sung, don't eat too much.</font>

700
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:34,640
<font color="yellow">Really, Song Joong Ki?</font>

701
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,800
<font color="yellow">Don't do that!</font>

702
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,540
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

703
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,500
<font color="yellow">Louis, you shouldn't splurge like this. You have to save money.</font>

704
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,540
<font color="yellow">Do you actually think that I'd eat...</font>

705
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,970
<font color="yellow">something this greasy in the middle of the night?</font>

706
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,740
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

707
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,670
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't eat all of this. How many calories does this have?</font>

708
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:16,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's fine. I'll just go for a run after.</font>

709
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,270
<font color="yellow">So we're back here now.</font>

710
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,400
<font color="yellow">Yes. Our place is the best, don't you think?</font>

711
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,370
<font color="yellow">Whatever. You enjoyed staying at Mr Cha's place.</font>

712
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,070
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is, I'm happy to be just with you.</font>

713
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,170
<font color="yellow">I'm happy that you'll cook only for me now.</font>

715
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,270
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking hard since last night.</font>

716
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,370
<font color="yellow">Seeing how even the president of the company picks on you...</font>

717
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,940
<font color="yellow">made me so upset.</font>

718
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,870
<font color="yellow">Quit your job. We can start an online shopping mall together.</font>

719
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,340
<font color="yellow">For some reason, I get the feeling that I'll be great at it.</font>

720
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,540
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

721
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,300
<font color="yellow">You don't trust me? I'm King of Shopping, Louis.</font>

722
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,040
<font color="yellow">I trust you, of course. I'm the only person who believes in you.</font>

723
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,340
<font color="yellow">I should learn more, though. Mr Cha told me to do so.</font>

724
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,740
<font color="yellow">Whatever. You're choosing Mr Cha over me.</font>

725
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,000
<font color="yellow">You're sulking over nothing again.</font>

727
