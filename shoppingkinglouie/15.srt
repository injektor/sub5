00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,660
<font color="yellow">You got it on your face.</font>

312
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,660
<font color="yellow">- You still have some food here.
- No, I'll do it.</font>

313
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,160
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- I'll do it.</font>

314
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,660
<font color="yellow">- But you injured your hand.
- I still can do it.</font>

315
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,100
<font color="yellow">- It will hurt.
- It won't.</font>

316
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,190
<font color="yellow">Bok Nam.</font>

317
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,100
<font color="yellow">- Bok Nam.
- They're here.</font>

318
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,290
<font color="yellow">- In Sung. Get the blankets.
- Okay.</font>

319
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,890
<font color="yellow">Move it.</font>

320
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,530
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, Bok Sil. Are you okay?
- Yes.</font>

321
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,460
<font color="yellow">- Oh my goodness. Lie down.
- Lie down.</font>

322
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,560
<font color="yellow">(BOK SIL'S MAIDS)</font>

323
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,930
<font color="yellow">My dear Bok Sil. You must've been so scared.</font>

324
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,290
<font color="yellow">You're hurt. Gosh.</font>

325
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,460
<font color="yellow">(BOK SIL'S MAIDS)</font>

326
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

327
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,290
<font color="yellow">It must've been hard.</font>

328
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,860
<font color="yellow">I said I'm fine. Don't treat me like a patient.</font>

329
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,460
<font color="yellow">No. You should take a rest. Get some sleep.</font>

330
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,090
<font color="yellow">Why did he kidnap Bok Sil and put her through all this?</font>

331
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,360
<font color="yellow">That jerk. He better watch out because I'm going to break his legs.</font>

332
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,190
<font color="yellow">Did the police catch the suspect?</font>

333
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,360
<font color="yellow">He's injured and unconscious.</font>

334
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,930
<font color="yellow">The guy at the hospital.</font>

335
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,660
<font color="yellow">There's a big chance that he's a hitman who is in Korea illegally.</font>

336
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,290
<font color="yellow">That's why we've been keeping a watchful eye on him.</font>

337
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,060
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me?
- How can he be Mr Baek's friend?</font>

338
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,330
<font color="yellow">Isn't it fishy?</font>

339
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,030
<font color="yellow">This is just my speculation,</font>

340
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,130
<font color="yellow">but I think Mr Baek could have hired him.</font>

341
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,060
<font color="yellow">If Mr Baek actually hired a hitman...</font>

342
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,990
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- That guy is so weird.</font>

343
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,830
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Yes, hello.</font>

344
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,060
<font color="yellow">Where is the guy who was just here?</font>

345
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,330
<font color="yellow">He just left.</font>

346
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,130
<font color="yellow">Do you know him?</font>

347
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,630
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

348
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,360
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

349
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,590
<font color="yellow">Never mind. It's nothing.</font>

350
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,330
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek could have known...</font>

351
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,890
<font color="yellow">about Louis being alive.</font>

352
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,230
<font color="yellow">But why did he keep it to himself?</font>

353
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,190
<font color="yellow">(LOUIS)</font>

354
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,660
<font color="yellow">I wanted a minor accident.</font>

355
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,860
<font color="yellow">I didn't want him to get into such a big accident.</font>

356
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,930
<font color="yellow">What will you do now? How will you take responsibility for it?</font>

357
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,630
<font color="yellow">He died!</font>

358
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,990
<font color="yellow">It's not like we wanted it to happen.</font>

359
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,960
<font color="yellow">We just followed the plan,</font>

360
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,560
<font color="yellow">but the driver sped up suddenly. That's why it became a big deal.</font>

361
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,160
<font color="yellow">That time,</font>

362
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,930
<font color="yellow">if the situation had not gotten out of hand like that,</font>

363
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,330
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have had to scheme...</font>

364
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,760
<font color="yellow">in order to cover up what happened.</font>

365
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,490
<font color="yellow">There's no point in regretting now.</font>

366
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,530
<font color="yellow">Detective, is Mr Goo still unconscious?</font>

367
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,730
<font color="yellow">If he wakes up, you have to ask him why he kidnapped Bok Sil.</font>

368
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,390
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of everything here. You should get some sleep.</font>

369
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,530
<font color="yellow">You've been running around so much since yesterday.</font>

370
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,930
<font color="yellow">The same goes to you.</font>

371
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,990
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you for everything.</font>

372
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,660
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

373
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,630
<font color="yellow">I brought a glass of warm milk.</font>

374
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,060
<font color="yellow">Please drink it and get some sleep.</font>

375
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,430
<font color="yellow">- Mr Kim.
- Yes, Master.</font>

376
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,630
<font color="yellow">Am I...</font>

377
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,630
<font color="yellow">allowed to drive?</font>

378
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,160
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking all of a sudden?</font>

379
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,760
<font color="yellow">I want to drive for Bok Sil.</font>

380
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,660
<font color="yellow">You used to go on about wanting to drive even when we lived in France.</font>

381
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,790
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

382
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,390
<font color="yellow">But when you arrived in Korea,</font>

383
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,730
<font color="yellow">you drove off in Mr Baek's car and caused a huge mess.</font>

384
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,960
<font color="yellow">Hence, Ms Choi might not allow you to drive.</font>

385
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,660
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

386
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,330
<font color="yellow">I drove off in his car?</font>

387
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,590
<font color="yellow">I heard you ran away in Mr Baek's car while he was in the washroom.</font>

388
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,030
<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

389
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,560
<font color="yellow">Something came up, so I have to stop by the office.</font>

390
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,230
<font color="yellow">You can drive, right?</font>

391
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,730
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

392
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,190
<font color="yellow">I never did such a thing.</font>

393
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,490
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

394
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,190
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

395
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,190
<font color="yellow">I have been suspicious of Mr Baek.</font>

396
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,560
<font color="yellow">He took your baby tooth as well as your watch from the house in Busan.</font>

397
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,290
<font color="yellow">I also ran into him when I went to look for you.</font>

398
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,730
<font color="yellow">But he's the one who brought you back,</font>

399
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,230
<font color="yellow">so I had no choice but to trust him.</font>

400
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,230
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

401
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,090
<font color="yellow">He did seem very surprised to see me that day.</font>

402
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,830
<font color="yellow">My memory came back.</font>

403
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,230
<font color="yellow">- He looked surprised then, too.
- What?</font>

404
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,660
<font color="yellow">The reason I shouldn't come back alive.</font>

405
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,390
<font color="yellow">The reason my memory shouldn't come back.</font>

406
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,590
<font color="yellow">What could it be?</font>

409
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,290
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to visit you so late.</font>

410
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,790
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

411
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,890
<font color="yellow">I was going to go see you tomorrow.</font>

412
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,630
<font color="yellow">Does that mean...</font>

413
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,130
<font color="yellow">you know why I'm here?</font>

414
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,630
<font color="yellow">Ji Sung,</font>

415
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,060
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

416
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,630
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

417
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek.</font>

418
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,060
<font color="yellow">I didn't...</font>

419
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,730
<font color="yellow">plan such a big accident from the beginning.</font>

420
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,960
<font color="yellow">I want Louis...</font>

421
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,290
<font color="yellow">to inherit Gold Group.</font>

422
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,130
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi didn't discuss it with me at all.</font>

423
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,060
<font color="yellow">She suddenly announced that she wants you to have Gold Group.</font>

424
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,260
<font color="yellow">I was livid when I heard that.</font>

425
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,990
<font color="yellow">I mean,</font>

426
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,630
<font color="yellow">I have devoted my life to growing Gold Group.</font>

427
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,090
<font color="yellow">Ever since your father passed away,</font>

428
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,090
<font color="yellow">I've been treating Ms Choi like my own mother.</font>

429
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,430
<font color="yellow">However, it was so easy for her to nudge me away.</font>

430
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,290
<font color="yellow">You were in a faraway land,</font>

431
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,130
<font color="yellow">but she decided to give you everything.</font>

432
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,560
<font color="yellow">Her decision hurt me so badly.</font>

433
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

434
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,530
<font color="yellow">that getting you injured a little through a car accident...</font>

435
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,890
<font color="yellow">would terrify her...</font>

436
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,460
<font color="yellow">and make her send you back to France.</font>

437
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,160
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

438
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,230
<font color="yellow">it got out of my hand.</font>

439
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,760
<font color="yellow">It turned into a huge accident, and I couldn't control it any more.</font>

440
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,560
<font color="yellow">Believe me, Ji Sung.</font>

441
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,560
<font color="yellow">I thought you were dead. Since the day you came back,</font>

442
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,190
<font color="yellow">I've been living every single day in anxiety.</font>

443
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,790
<font color="yellow">I've been so nervous...</font>

444
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,060
<font color="yellow">about people finding out what I did.</font>

445
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,290
<font color="yellow">I've been feeling as if I'm a fugitive on the run.</font>

446
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,230
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek.</font>

447
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,090
<font color="yellow">I know that you've been looking after my grandma by her side...</font>

448
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,660
<font color="yellow">instead of me and my deceased parents,</font>

449
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,230
<font color="yellow">and I really appreciate it.</font>

450
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,590
<font color="yellow">Louis...</font>

451
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,260
<font color="yellow">That alone should be enough for me to forgive you,</font>

452
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,130
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

453
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,160
<font color="yellow">someone died because of the accident.</font>

454
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,590
<font color="yellow">I will accept punishment...</font>

455
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
<font color="yellow">for what I did.</font>

456
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,730
<font color="yellow">I have actually been...</font>

457
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,290
<font color="yellow">sorting things out in order to turn myself in.</font>

458
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,290
<font color="yellow">The company shares Ms Choi gave me.</font>

459
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,430
<font color="yellow">I told Attorney Hwang...</font>

460
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,290
<font color="yellow">that I want to transfer them all to you.</font>

461
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,660
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek.</font>

462
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,960
<font color="yellow">I guess it's human nature.</font>

<font color="yellow">- A stalker?
- Yes.</font>

521

522

524
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,530

526
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,000

527
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,190
<font color="yellow">Isn't this enough for evidence?</font>

528
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,890
<font color="yellow">You should become a detective. You're so observant.</font>

529
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,160
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

530
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,000
<font color="yellow">why were you at the bookstore?</font>

531
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,460
<font color="yellow">You seem quite close to her.</font>

532
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,190
<font color="yellow">It's difficult for a woman to run a bookstore alone.</font>

533
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,430
<font color="yellow">Besides, she helped us a lot in finding Louis.</font>

534
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,500
<font color="yellow">To express my gratitude, I often helped her with...</font>

535
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,430
<font color="yellow">- carrying heavy books.
- You like to pry, don't you?</font>

536
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,160
<font color="yellow">You should mind your own business.</font>

537
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,330
<font color="yellow">Why did you take...</font>

538
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,590
<font color="yellow">the risk of kidnapping Ma Ri?</font>

539
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,830
<font color="yellow">What about the money you received at first?</font>

540
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,090
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a choice because the money got stolen.</font>

541
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,030
<font color="yellow">That old lady had amazing pickpocketing skills.</font>

542
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,760
<font color="yellow">She's a professional pickpocket?</font>

543
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,960
<font color="yellow">Detective Nam, what are you doing?</font>

544
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,030
<font color="yellow">- Did you get the camera recordings?
- And her identity as well.</font>

545
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,560
<font color="yellow">She's Cho Ha Ni with nine prior pickpocketing convictions.</font>

546
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,660
<font color="yellow">I caught her in the past.</font>

547
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,790
<font color="yellow">Can you find out where she is now?</font>

548
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,090
<font color="yellow">This is my area of expertise.</font>

549
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,330
<font color="yellow">I sent some people already.</font>

550
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,160
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

551
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,760
<font color="yellow">Please stop denying it. You were caught on the surveillance camera.</font>

552
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,360
<font color="yellow">That wasn't me.</font>

553
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,660
<font color="yellow">It was someone who looks like me.</font>

554
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,530
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

555
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,130
<font color="yellow">I'm glad that you got better.</font>

556
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,360
<font color="yellow">- You should still be careful, okay?
- Okay.</font>

557
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,630
<font color="yellow">Let's stop by the police station.</font>

558
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,000
<font color="yellow">I told Mr Baek to apologise to you in person.</font>

559
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,560
<font color="yellow">But he didn't kidnap me.</font>

560
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,160
<font color="yellow">- Let's pay him a visit anyway.
- Okay.</font>

561
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,390
<font color="yellow">Ms Cho, let's get it over with.</font>

562
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,260
<font color="yellow">Where is the money?</font>

563
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,430
<font color="yellow">You really don't believe me, do you?</font>

564
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,090
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what time is it?</font>

565
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,890
<font color="yellow">Detective,</font>

566
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,390
<font color="yellow">how can you keep me here without any evidence?</font>

567
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,660
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

568
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,190

577
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,660
<font color="yellow">you'll return the money because it belongs to someone I know.</font>

578
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,290
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what you're talking about.</font>

579
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,930
<font color="yellow">Detective must be waiting.</font>

580
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,630

00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,830

583
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,960
<font color="yellow">They look so cheap.</font>

584
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,230
<font color="yellow">I don't want this.</font>

585
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,830
<font color="yellow">Then why don't you go only with your underwear on?</font>

586
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,760
<font color="yellow">I've never met anyone so obsessed...</font>

588
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,460

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

590
