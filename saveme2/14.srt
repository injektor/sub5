00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,486
I'm hungry! Something delicious!

3
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:23,804
Why I ought to...!

4
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:25,993
Don't treat him that way.

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,540
Goodness, okay.

6
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:32,999
Of course, I'll do as you say.

7
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:35,101
Good job today.

8
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,982
Please keep up the good work.

9
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,217
You're building the religious community, right?

10
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,977
Of course.

11
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:43,490
Don't get foolish ideas now.

12
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:45,639
Just think of the townspeople.

13
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:48,984
It must be great that you're so popular.

14
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:51,907
My Ji-sun must be so happy in heaven.

15
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,174
Hallelujah.

16
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,411
Yes.

17
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:56,466
Hallelujah.

18
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,649
How could you ask me to be with Satan?

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,840
How could you ask me to work with the devil?

20
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:26,244
Just what... is your plan?

21
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:28,076
Father...

22
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:35,692
Pastor, don't cry.

23
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,755
If you cry, you're a baby.

24
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,034
I'm not crying.

25
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:44,003
If you laugh while crying, you get hairy down here.

26
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,428
Poor Sung-ho....

27
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,352
I'll protect you.

28
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:57,735
I trust you.

29
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:58,961
I do.

30
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:06,584
I will send you to heaven.

31
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:09,531
That feels refreshing.

32
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,087
It's good!

33
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:37,278
It's the best!

34
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,730
I'll buy you more.

35
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:41,691
If you want more, I'll buy you more.

36
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,034
You're the best, pastor.

37
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:44,176
You're an angel!

38
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:48,526
Sung-ho.

39
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:50,881
You can become an angel too.

40
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:53,411
Really?

41
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:02,870
Why are you doing this?

42
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:04,852
Get up!

43
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,409
Why are you doing this?

44
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:14,455
I told you I'll kill you if you come back here, you bastard!

45
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,359
That reckless bastard.

46
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:49,053
Bastard, stop right there!

47
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:36,805
I heard he stabbed him in the stomach.

48
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:37,819
Goodness!

49
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,209
How scary!

50
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:45,454
(Save Me 2)

51
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,564
(Episode 14)

52
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:00,587
What's this "T"?

53
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,357
Why is it so chaotic here?

54
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:23,729
Why isn't the scene being preserved?

55
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,766
This is a mess.

56
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:30,704
Who allowed them in?

57
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,079
I'm the chief here and he's...

58
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:35,326
I understand.

59
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:36,893
I'll contact you if we need you.

60
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,459
What do you mean?

61
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,520
Do you know this neighborhood?

62
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:47,220
You can't treat us like this if you're going to question people.

63
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,540
Okay.

64
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,051
Don't disturb the crime scene.

65
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,539
Let's go outside and talk.

66
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:00,059
You call yourself a police officer and yet...

67
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,947
Be thorough.

68
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,424
He's not from around here and he doesn't have his wallet or cellphone...

69
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:12,303
I think it will take some time to figure out who he is.

70
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,223
Are you sure he's an outsider?

71
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:15,244
I'm sure.

72
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:17,758
He came to our station to ask for directions.

73
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:22,852
Chief, all the security cameras in the motel corridors are all fake.

74
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:26,094
They say the one at the entrance was broken early in the morning.

75
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:27,216
Just one?

76
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:28,809
Jeez.

77
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:31,749
It's because the neighborhood's a dump.

78
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,622
A dump?

79
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:37,359
A dump? It's not because it's a dump!

80
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:39,987
It's because it's a crime-free neighborhood!

81
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:43,529
- Why did...
- Hey!

82
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,219
- Did someone really die in there?
- Yes.

83
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:47,687
It was very vicious.

84
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:49,659
He was stabbed multiple times here.

85
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,318
Is this a horror movie or what?

86
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,799
Reality's scarier than movies these days.

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,326
Anyways, who died?

88
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,048
Go away!

89
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,685
You can't stay here.

90
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:02,949
You can't stay here!

91
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,220
Please go away! Don't spread rumors! Go!

92
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:08,719
Sir.

93
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,295
Did someone really die?

94
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:11,403
Who was it?

95
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,878
I need to talk to you for a second.

96
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,857
Please go back to your houses now.

97
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,106
He's an outsider.

98
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,584
Did an outsider recently come to your cafe?

99
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:29,924
Goodness! That bastard...!

100
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,787
A crazy bastard came to my place.

101
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,046
Tell me more.

102
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:38,424
I never saw him before but he made a mess at my cafe and he hit me.

103
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:42,333
But Min-cheol showed up and saved me.

104
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,201
He made a mess at your cafe and Min-cheol stopped him?

105
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,890
Sir.

106
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:51,264
If it wasn't for Min-cheol, I would've been beaten to death that day.

107
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,110
Okay....

108
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:56,173
Jeez.

109
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,566
Hey!

110
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,660
You!

111
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:04,464
Hello!

112
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:07,885
Fasten that!

113
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:09,018
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:11,546
You...

115
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,573
You were here on a delivery last night here, right?

116
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,265
You brat.

117
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,260
Look carefully.

118
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,724
You delivered that, right?

119
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:26,719
Yes.

120
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:28,016
What time was that?

121
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,051
I think it was past 2 a.m.

122
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:32,202
2 a.m.?

123
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:33,580
Are you sure?

124
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:36,352
I left work right after making the delivery here.

125
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:40,703
Anyways, did he really die?

126
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:28,940
You said you had a headache.

127
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,230
Are you okay?

128
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,728
I took some medication so I should be fine.

129
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:37,902
I'm going to get some air and head over to the bus stop.

130
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,028
Okay.

131
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,982
It's time to pop open this!

132
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,560
Young-sun!

133
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,412
It's me! Young-sun!

134
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,199
Pastor?

135
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:33,904
We're going to go somewhere nice at night.

136
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:39,108
It's a welfare foundation in Seoul.

137
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:43,765
I brought you 2 months' worth of pay in advance.

138
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:45,825
Ma'am.

139
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,250
You need to return to school.

140
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,928
Will you just stop here?

141
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:27,727
It must be great that you're so popular.

142
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:29,936
Hallelujah.

143
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,770
Pastor.

144
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:44,817
Young-sun.

145
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:49,725
What's wrong?

146
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:56,300
I remembered.

147
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,459
I remembered.

148
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:06,398
Elder Choi... sold me there.

149
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:11,402
He gave me some strange drug too.

150
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:16,993
Elder Choi...

151
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,617
He used me.

152
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:25,184
Don't worry. Nothing happened.

153
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,077
I had hoped that you wouldn't know.

154
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:52,194
I thought it would make things hard for you.

155
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,441
So I didn't tell you.

156
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,348
(Wanted for Fraud - Choi Kyung-seok (55))

157
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,143
Choi Kyung-seok.

158
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:27,872
That's right.

159
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,712
He's not an elder.

160
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:34,041
He's a scam artist with 12 priors.

161
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:35,623
We need to report this.

162
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,629
Why haven't you reported him yet?

163
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,718
As you already know,

164
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:45,906
most of the townspeople gave their entire fortunes for the religious community.

165
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,419
If he's arrested now,

166
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:49,750
then the religious community won't be made.

167
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:52,949
I couldn't let that happen.

168
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,040
Because of the townspeople.

169
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,023
Because of the religious community,

170
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:03,044
Ms. Lee was saved and she was able to go to heaven.

171
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,127
She didn't have to worry about Sung-ho or the baby.

172
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:09,953
She passed away in peace.

173
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:16,965
The task that the Heavenly Father gave me...

174
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,621
I will finish it, no matter what.

175
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,052
Please join me.

176
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,146
If you want,

177
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,499
I'll do anything to help...

178
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,019
Thank you, Young-sun.

179
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,180
Min-cheol!

180
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:55,297
Min-cheol!

181
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:56,506
Min-cheol! Min-cheol!

182
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:57,816
Min-cheol! Get up!

183
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:59,140
Hey, wake up!

184
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,880
- Min-cheol!
- What?

185
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:02,205
That man died.

186
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,225
Who?

187
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:04,616
The guy who hit me!

188
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,708
You know that thug!

189
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:08,792
He died at the motel!

190
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,048
- The motel?
- Yes.

191
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:14,178
I heard he was stabbed.

192
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,072
- Jeez!
- No way.

193
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:17,307
He really died?

194
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:19,717
You know...

195
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:23,004
I guess people really shouldn't do anything bad.

196
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:24,884
You'll be punished for them someday.

197
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,272
He was killed at a strange place.

198
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:29,732
He was killed like an animal.

199
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:32,112
My goodness.

200
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:33,571
How scary.

201
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:46,863
We're almost there.

202
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,290
You scared me!

203
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:51,736
Don't scare me like that!

204
00:15:51,895 --> 00:15:52,915
I'm sorry, sir.

205
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,546
The bus is here.

206
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:58,057
I brought the money we collected in cash yesterday.

207
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:00,365
Okay.

208
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,246
Why do you keep collecting it in cash when it's so inconvenient?

209
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,797
It would be easier to wire transfer.

210
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,525
You fool.

211
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:13,536
Do you know why I haven't been caught when I have been wanted for 4 years?

212
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:17,182
Don't leave any evidence behind.

213
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:19,359
I see.

214
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:20,596
Goodness.

215
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:22,776
Let's go work.

216
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,436
Welcome!

217
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,075
- Hello!
- Hello!

218
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,635
Thank you!

219
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,040
Welcome!

220
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,588
Is there something wrong?

221
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:50,981
I want to go to heaven.

222
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:54,073
I gave you all of my compensation money.

223
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,569
Good job!

224
00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:58,734
That's fine.

225
00:16:58,735 --> 00:16:59,755
But...

226
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,674
These two don't have anything.

227
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:07,445
I want to get on that bus and go to heaven too.

228
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:10,472
Elder Choi, is there a way for us?

229
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:12,884
Please wait a little, ma'am.

230
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,202
(Ji-woong)

231
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:19,068
Yes, bring me a document and hurry over here.

232
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,089
Yes.

233
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:26,590
Heavenly Father makes the impossible possible.

234
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:27,611
Oh, my!

235
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,604
- Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

236
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:33,764
(Promissory Note)

237
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:35,163
Did you read it all?

238
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:38,594
You just need to stamp it right there.

239
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,759
Hurry up and stamp it so we can all go to heaven.

240
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,469
(Creditor, debtor)

241
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:55,084
I can go to heaven now too!

242
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:56,871
Good job!

243
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,272
You're not going to do it?

244
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,910
If you don't feel comfortable,

245
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:06,650
then it's fine.

246
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:09,823
- I...
- Stamp it so we can go together!

247
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,632
I need to ask my kids.

248
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:15,097
I'll do it next time.

249
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:17,776
Yes, go ahead. It's fine.

250
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,898
Then let's get on the bus now.

251
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:23,858
Let's go.

252
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:24,883
Follow me.

253
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:29,891
Let's go.

254
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,516
What happened to this bastard?

255
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:44,076
The phone you are currently calling is turned off right now. Please leave a...

256
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:45,729
Sir.

257
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,535
I think he ran away.

258
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,618
No, this bastard wouldn't just leave without getting his money.

259
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:52,552
Then should I go check the motel?

260
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:56,175
Go to the city and find out where that bastard ran away to.

261
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,278
Tell Ji-woong to take care of the rest.

262
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,299
Yes, sir.

263
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:01,996
This bastard.

264
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:04,286
The phone you...

265
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:13,992
Ma'am!

266
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:16,590
Please tell me more!

267
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:19,476
I told everything to the detective already!

268
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,129
A person died!

269
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,430
You should answer when the police asks you a question!

270
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:26,172
Fine!

271
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,131
What do you want to know?

272
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:32,456
When did that man come here?

273
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,193
It's been about 3-4 days.

274
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:39,014
He told me he was staying here for a week.

275
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,598
So I even got paid in advance.

276
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,339
Then exactly when did he come back last night?

277
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:47,926
Do you remember?

278
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:51,732
I remember.

279
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,699
He came back past 1 a.m.

280
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,624
He ran to the second floor.

281
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,100
And then Kim Min-cheol followed him right after that.

282
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,811
Goodness!

283
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:03,645
How scary!

284
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,939
Kim Min-cheol?

285
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,527
Are you sure it was him?

286
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:09,523
Yes!

287
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:13,004
Kim Min-cheol, that bastard!

288
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,267
Hey.

289
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,800
Make sure no one enters here.

290
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,120
Stop! Stop!

291
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,248
Sir, we have a suspect.

292
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,487
They say they found Kim Min-cheol on the footage.

293
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:26,657
He's wanted right now.

294
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,831
We need to find him first. Let's go!

295
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,094
Hurry! Hurry!

296
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,010
Here comes the makgeolli!

297
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:45,273
Makgeolli's here!

298
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:47,592
This is very cold right now.

299
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:52,018
- Chil-sung, are you really not going to go with us?
- Yes.

300
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:56,468
I guess Mi-sun's very tired after yesterday's congratulatory service.

301
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,597
So I'm going to let her rest today.

302
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,718
I'm going to get her favorite food too.

303
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:04,227
Goodness! We have a great husband in Wolchoo-ri!

304
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:06,891
Goodness, here comes our savior!

305
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,781
- Pastor!
- Pastor!

306
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:09,802
Pastor!

307
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:13,676
Believing in you is like believing in God.

308
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,935
You know you're the only one we trust, right?

309
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:19,451
Yes.

310
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:21,253
Young-sun, you're going too, right?

311
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:23,724
Yes, my mom and I are going.

312
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:25,787
Good, good.

313
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:26,973
Hey, Chil-sung.

314
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:28,964
You should go with us too.

315
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:33,536
We already know where we're going.

316
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:36,981
Please just take a picture for us.

317
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:39,155
Okay. Don't worry.

318
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:40,653
- I'll send you one.
- Yes!

319
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:43,497
Shall we all take pictures on our cellphones?

320
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,142
You'll miss your hometown when the town is submerged.

321
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:50,110
You should take pictures so you can look at it whenever you miss it.

322
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:51,538
Wow!

323
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,386
We didn't even think of that!

324
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:55,640
- You're the best!
- Yes!

325
00:21:55,784 --> 00:21:57,529
- I'll take it.
- Let's take it!

326
00:21:57,557 --> 00:21:58,577
Hey, hey.

327
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:00,387
- Be in the middle.
- Goodness.

328
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:01,747
Okay.

329
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:03,857
1, 2, 3!

330
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:06,917
I'll take one more.

331
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:09,950
Okay! 1, 2, 3!

332
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:15,014
You should join them too.

333
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,035
I'll take it.

334
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:17,284
Shall I?

335
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:20,414
Hurry up and join us!

336
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:22,618
- Let's take a picture!
- Hurry up!

337
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,670
Goodness, the sun is going to set at this rate!

338
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:26,772
Goodness!

339
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:28,954
- Hurry over!
- Okay!

340
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:30,595
- Let's do it.
- Here I go.

341
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:32,834
1, 2, 3!

342
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:37,431
One more time. Smile! 1, 2, 3!

343
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:44,192
Let's go.

344
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,505
Where's Elder Choi?

345
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:53,073
He's been on his cellphone over there for a while.

346
00:22:56,736 --> 00:22:57,756
I see.

347
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:05,131
What is going on with this bastard?

348
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:13,896
Elder Choi.

349
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:15,732
I think everybody's here.

350
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:16,763
Let's go now.

351
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:18,512
Not everybody's here.

352
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:21,318
We shouldn't make the elders wait.

353
00:23:29,322 --> 00:23:31,575
What's wrong with that bastard?

354
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,459
This is pissing me off.

355
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:41,540
Min-cheol, where are you going?

356
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:44,645
This won't do. I need to find out what's going on.

357
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:49,976
I have a bad feeling about this. Shouldn't you just stay in hiding?

358
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:51,023
No, no.

359
00:23:53,457 --> 00:24:53,331
(Ads 00:23:53 --> 00:24:53)

360
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,914
Min-cheol, where are you going?

361
00:24:57,355 --> 00:25:00,131
This won't do. I need to find out what's going on.

362
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:05,388
I have a bad feeling about this. Shouldn't you just stay in hiding?

363
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,430
No, no.

364
00:25:11,574 --> 00:25:12,972
Yes, who is it?

365
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:15,259
We're the police.

366
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:17,009
I have a few questions to ask.

367
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:18,370
What should I do?

368
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:20,332
Yes, give me a second.

369
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:34,375
Yes?

370
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,992
You know Mr. Kim Min-cheol, right?

371
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:42,429
Kim Min-cheol?

372
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,853
Why?

373
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,118
He's a suspect for the motel murder.

374
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,827
It's been a while since I saw him.

375
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:56,064
I see.

376
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:57,609
Excuse me!

377
00:25:57,685 --> 00:25:59,389
Excuse me! What are you doing?

378
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,408
You can't do this!

379
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:04,723
What are you doing?

380
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,118
Stay still.

381
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,083
A detective can't just do this!

382
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:12,399
You're being ridiculous!

383
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:17,121
What are you doing at a single woman's house!

384
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,533
Kim Min-cheol! Stop right there!

385
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:26,021
You bastard!

386
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:50,806
Hey!

387
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,356
Stop the car! Stop the car!

388
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:01,472
It's Kim Min-cheol.

389
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:09,222
That rat.

390
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,743
Where did he hide?

391
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:12,810
- Go this way.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:39,905
This is driving me insane.

393
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,989
Kim Min-cheol!

394
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:48,473
I didn't do it!

395
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:50,953
I didn't do it!

396
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,091
You bastard.

397
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,686
He's not around here.

398
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,907
Jeez! Just where did he go?

399
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:06,308
I'm sure he didn't get far.

400
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:10,370
He's not over there too.

401
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:14,197
Kim Min-cheol had a history of murder and assault.

402
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,008
I'm sure he's the killer.

403
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,554
- So call me right away when you see him.
- Yes.

404
00:28:18,555 --> 00:28:21,431
We'll patrol this area.

405
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:22,624
Okay.

406
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:24,654
Ask for backup.

407
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:25,692
Yes.

408
00:28:56,244 --> 00:28:58,825
It feels like we're going on a trip, right?

409
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:08,365
Pastor, Dane!

410
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:10,789
- Dance!
- Get up! Get up!

411
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:25,249
Please sit. Please sit.

412
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,444
You shouldn't do this inside the bus!

413
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:36,043
Pastor!

414
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:44,462
They say that man's dead.

415
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:46,218
I think he was murdered.

416
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:47,830
The police are here too.

417
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:28,162
What's wrong with me again?

418
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:06,380
We have a baby. Our baby.

419
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,432
Let's go home.

420
00:31:10,405 --> 00:31:12,179
Hurry up and run away! Hurry!

421
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:43,264
(Wolchoo-ri Religious Community Construction)

422
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,188
You can get off now!

423
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:55,697
Watch the steps!

424
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,240
Please follow me.

425
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,750
Please follow me.

426
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:07,973
Is it here?

427
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,501
Oh, my!

428
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:16,302
It's so nice!

429
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,330
Like this?

430
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:21,475
Oh, there it is.

431
00:32:22,113 --> 00:32:25,872
So that's going to be Sung-ho's house.

432
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,743
- You're right.
- Sung-ho's house.

433
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:29,416
You see your house there, right?

434
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:31,747
The place where they dug up the dirt. Go play there!

435
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:32,911
My house's the best!

436
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:34,168
We're in heaven!

437
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,800
My goodness!

438
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:42,872
- That's Chil-sung's house, right?
- There?

439
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:44,162
Yes, over there.

440
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,281
You're right.

441
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:48,013
That's my house next to it.

442
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,257
Chil-sung.

443
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:53,986
This is heaven.

444
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:56,010
This is your place.

445
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,928
It feels like God's gift.

446
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,439
Choi Kyung-seok.

447
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:06,171
You think he'll back down?

448
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,839
Just trust me.

449
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:12,350
God won't forgive him.

450
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:28,437
I was going to cook for you.

451
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:30,105
This is your job.

452
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,883
I'm going to start swearing.

453
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,405
It's so good!

454
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:43,072
I'm glad.

455
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,777
Here we go.

456
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:49,223
Be careful! It's hot!

457
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,336
It looks so good!

458
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:56,332
Here. This, this.

459
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,729
Cheers.

460
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:21,997
Honey, let me roll this up for you.

461
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:23,418
Try this.

462
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,620
How is it?

463
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:29,290
It's nice and savory, right?

464
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:30,715
Yes.

465
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:31,769
Oh, right!

466
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:35,962
I forgot to show you this.

467
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:37,945
This.

468
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:40,137
This.

469
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:46,323
This is our place in heaven where we're going to live.

471
00:35:08,762 --> 00:35:10,369
Okay, gather around now!

472
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:11,532
Gather around!

473
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,256
Sir!

474
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:14,691
Thanks for your hard work.

475
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:16,628
He's the construction manager.

476
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:17,974
Hello!

477
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:19,919
Welcome!

478
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:24,960
As you all know, everything's made of the best quality and it's Eco-friendly.

479
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:26,650
So we're being very careful.

480
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:29,664
We're using Hinoki cypress for the interior.

481
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:31,265
So it smells great!

482
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:35,170
As you can see here, in the middle of the religious community,

483
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,506
the church will be here.

484
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:40,021
It's a place to communicate with heaven.

485
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,190
Yes.

486
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:42,682
And in the surrounding areas,

487
00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:45,388
we'll have a gym, library, and a pool.

488
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:48,487
We'll even have a medical center!

489
00:35:49,636 --> 00:35:51,436
Yes, that's right.

490
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:54,462
The areas around the religious community are truly great.

491
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:58,614
And each house is a single family house, of course.

492
00:35:58,943 --> 00:36:05,717
It will be easy to think of it as a townhouse which is considered the best in Gangnam.

493
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:08,261
It sounds great!

494
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:12,696
Yes, yes.

495
00:36:13,322 --> 00:36:15,836
And we'll have big windows.

496
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,235
So the sunlight will be...

497
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:18,256
Okay.

498
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:24,221
It seems like we went through most of it.

499
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:34,712
I'll make sure to make your house completely broke so just wait and see.

500
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,499
You.

501
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:21,752
I heard you got into a fight with that man from the motel.

502
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:25,896
Yes, that's right. We got into a fight and I followed him.

503
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:36,399
You crazy bastard, stop following me!

504
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:39,220
You're dead meat, you bastard!

505
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:59,999
You bastard, I told you I'll kill you if you come back.

506
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:15,862
Do you know what room that bastard who just went up is staying in?

507
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:17,469
I don't know!

508
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:20,119
What's wrong with you?

509
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,959
That's ti.

510
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:40,022
I know.

511
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:44,912
The motel owner said you went outside in 5-10 minutes.

512
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:45,933
I know.

513
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:48,981
So there's no reason for me to be chased by the detectives right now.

514
00:38:48,982 --> 00:38:50,002
You're wrong.

515
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:53,831
You were the last one seen in the motel security camera.

516
00:38:54,155 --> 00:38:57,662
And based on your criminal history....

517
00:38:58,444 --> 00:39:00,820
Everybody will think it's you.

518
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,124
This is crap.

519
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,010
Go.

520
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,515
Just leave!

521
00:39:15,607 --> 00:39:16,718
Where would I go?

522
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:20,915
You know I'm not the killer! Do something!

523
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:21,936
You idiot!

524
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:25,461
You know I'm older than you but you still talk to me with no respect!

525
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:26,686
That's why you...!

526
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,219
Let's go.

527
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:39,408
Why did you help Kim Min-cheol?

528
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,148
Because he's not the killer.

529
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:45,351
Since when was that important?

530
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:48,715
You tried to send him jail by making up crimes before.

531
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:54,704
I wonder who the real killer is.

532
00:40:59,939 --> 00:41:00,959
Delivery.

533
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:03,292
Hey.

534
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:04,741
Why did it take so long?

535
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:06,007
Hurry up!

536
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,028
Yes.

537
00:41:15,185 --> 00:41:16,715
Hey, where are the free dumplings?

538
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:18,020
There's no such thing.

539
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:20,748
Hey, that's a given when you order sweet and sour pork.

540
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:22,850
The countryside people are so stingy.

541
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:23,871
What?

542
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,390
Hey, are you going to bring me the fried dumplings?

543
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:27,411
Fine.

544
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:28,921
- Bring it, okay?
- Okay.

545
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:30,639
Hurry up and go!

546
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,740
Yes.

547
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:38,129
It's past 2 again.

548
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,824
I need to get paid more.

549
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:23,980
Who's doing that?

550
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,949
What's wrong with you?

551
00:42:30,938 --> 00:42:32,126
What the hell!

552
00:42:38,735 --> 00:42:41,438
Who's doing that! I ought to kill you!

553
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:45,006
Damn it!

554
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:54,379
(Ads 00:42:54 --> 00:43:54)

555
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:10,430
It's open! Come in!

556
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,804
You should've brought it earlier.

557
00:44:15,191 --> 00:44:16,211
Leave it there.

558
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:21,063
What the hell!

559
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:30,092
Satan!

560
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,087
You sinned because you didn't repent when you were given a chance!

561
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,955
You sinned because you went against God's will!

562
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:39,437
You dirty Satan!

563
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:45,437
I am punishing you for also taking advantage of our Heavenly Father!

564
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:35,106
Evil soul.

565
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,503
You were judged by God's will.

566
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,317
And executed.

567
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:06,239
We're going to heaven soon.

568
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,440
Chil-sung.

569
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:17,178
Chil-sung, you were home?

570
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:26,969
Chil-sung!

571
00:47:40,643 --> 00:47:41,663
Mi-sun.

572
00:48:00,852 --> 00:48:02,613
Chil-sung, Mi-sun's cold...

573
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,701
Chil-sung!

574
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:09,280
Look.

575
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,295
My Mi-sun...

576
00:48:13,907 --> 00:48:15,909
Come look.

577
00:48:17,654 --> 00:48:18,924
She looks pretty, right?

578
00:48:20,112 --> 00:48:26,405
She has a million dollar smile.

579
00:48:27,901 --> 00:48:29,368
Mi-sun's dead.

580
00:48:31,835 --> 00:48:35,290
I guess she was very happy after she gave her testimony yesterday.

581
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:39,024
She was in a hurry to go to heaven.

582
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,999
So she left first.

583
00:48:44,326 --> 00:48:49,770
I've never seen Mi-sun so happy before.

584
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:53,212
This is all thanks to this.

585
00:48:53,938 --> 00:48:55,738
It's all thanks to the water of life.

586
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:00,889
What happened?

587
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:06,735
Stop.

588
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:08,252
Chil-sung, stop.

589
00:49:08,284 --> 00:49:09,362
Chil-sung, please stop.

590
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,118
Let's go out. Let's go to the hospital.

591
00:49:11,404 --> 00:49:12,707
Let's go to the hospital.

592
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:14,719
Okay, okay.

593
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:20,025
My Mi-sun's the happiest right now.

594
00:49:21,747 --> 00:49:22,767
Mi-sun.

595
00:49:22,828 --> 00:49:25,410
I'll join you soon, okay?

596
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:27,481
Get a hold of yourself.

597
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:29,782
Chil-sung, what's wrong with you. Please stop.

598
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:32,292
Chil-sung, look at me. Look at me.

599
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:33,808
They're all frauds.

600
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:35,754
They're a cult and they're scam artists.

601
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:37,630
They fooled you and you were fooled.

602
00:49:37,753 --> 00:49:39,591
Get a hold of yourself! They're scam artists.

603
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:42,818
What's wrong with that?

604
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:49,081
I'm so happy and at peace right now.

605
00:49:49,082 --> 00:49:52,495
Who care if they're a cult or a group of scam artists?

606
00:49:52,712 --> 00:49:55,144
Why is that important?

607
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:58,265
Here I have...

608
00:50:05,148 --> 00:50:06,168
I...

609
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:08,677
Chil-sung!

610
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:10,141
Chil-sung, what's wrong with you?

611
00:50:10,142 --> 00:50:11,670
What's wrong with you? Chil-sung!

612
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:13,663
Chil-sung, what's wrong with you?

613
00:50:15,374 --> 00:50:16,394
Chil-sung!

614
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:19,567
Chil-sung!

615
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:23,385
Hello?

616
00:50:23,528 --> 00:50:27,040
This is Wolchoo-ri Chil-sung Supermarket...

617
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:30,483
I did it for fun.

618
00:50:30,484 --> 00:50:31,504
Be quiet.

619
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,288
Kim Min-cheol is the suspect.

620
00:50:41,726 --> 00:50:43,051
The police are after him.

621
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,679
This is good for us, right?

622
00:50:47,038 --> 00:50:48,058
Of course.

623
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,613
Of course!

624
00:50:50,911 --> 00:50:52,516
This is helpful.

625
00:50:58,654 --> 00:50:59,674
Okay, everybody.

626
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:04,754
How do you feel now that you saw the religious community construction today?

627
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:06,506
We feel great!

628
00:51:06,883 --> 00:51:08,525
Yes, that's right.

629
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:11,353
A place to connect with heaven.

630
00:51:11,742 --> 00:51:13,345
Today's your last chance!

631
00:51:13,412 --> 00:51:16,610
Time does not wait for us!

632
00:51:16,818 --> 00:51:18,890
You will miss your chance if you don't grab it.

633
00:51:19,222 --> 00:51:22,563
They said life is a continuous cycle of choices.

634
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:29,245
Your life depends on what kind of choices you make!

635
00:51:29,246 --> 00:51:34,472
Today, heaven gave us one last chance!

636
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:36,592
I want to live there too!

637
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:38,081
Hallelujah!

638
00:51:38,499 --> 00:51:39,927
Hallelujah!

639
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:43,110
(Admission Application)
- Everybody else, please make a decision soon!

640
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:45,304
- Who needs an application?
- Give me one too!

641
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:46,918
Over there! Hallelujah!

642
00:51:46,919 --> 00:51:48,182
- Yes!
- Give me one too!

643
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:49,937
Yes! Hallelujah!

644
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:53,526
God bless you all!

645
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,829
The pastor will take care of us.

646
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:23,031
Everybody.

647
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:25,329
I have some urgent business to take care of.

648
00:52:25,464 --> 00:52:26,785
So I'm getting off first.

649
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:29,623
I hope you have a safe trip home!

650
00:52:29,624 --> 00:52:32,197
- Thank you!
- Good work!

651
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:02,649
Ms. Kim Mi-sun died on June 20th at 21:37.

652
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:05,189
She was dead when she arrive here

653
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:08,009
so the current time is her time of death.

654
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:16,058
Why did she die, doctor? I thought she just had a cold.

655
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:19,741
I saw her medical records

656
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,871
and she was in the last stage of lung cancer.

657
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:25,275
Her cause of death was lung cancer.

658
00:53:25,481 --> 00:53:27,521
I don't know what else to say.

659
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:33,344
Doctor, what's wrong with Chil-sung then?

660
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,255
It seems like seizures from shock.

661
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:40,165
But I think we'll know more after we get his CT results and other test results.

662
00:53:42,188 --> 00:53:43,763
Let's wait a little more.

663
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:45,068
Thank you.

664
00:54:02,203 --> 00:54:03,388
Chil-sung, are you okay?

665
00:54:05,365 --> 00:54:06,385
Chil-sung.

666
00:54:12,384 --> 00:54:15,958
Give... me some water.

667
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:20,056
Okay, wait a little.

668
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,410
Heavenly Father.

669
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:51,254
I believe that my Mi-sun is in heaven.

670
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:59,095
Thank you for allowing my Mi-sun to step foot into heaven.

671
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:04,439
The happiness Mi-sun didn't have here on Earth...

672
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:13,149
Please take care of her so she can have that happiness in heaven.

673
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,260
Chil-sung.

674
00:55:14,443 --> 00:55:15,530
I brought water.

675
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:17,165
Stop and drink some water.

676
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:21,321
Why...

677
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:29,568
Do you not want me to be happy?

678
00:55:32,985 --> 00:55:34,618
I want to pray.

679
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:36,423
Please don't bother me.

680
00:55:41,693 --> 00:55:44,062
Please...

681
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:52,748
...allow me to live as your servant all my life, God.

682
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:26,247
Goodness, hello!

683
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:27,406
Hello!

684
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:33,710
Goodness, what brings you here?

685
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:38,114
Yes, I was in the neighborhood so I dropped by to see you.

686
00:56:38,115 --> 00:56:39,135
I see.

687
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,772
Please have a seat here.

688
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:41,793
Yes.

689
00:56:44,142 --> 00:56:45,523
Would you like a cup of coffee?

690
00:56:45,524 --> 00:56:47,294
A cup of water is fine.

691
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:48,315
Yes.

692
00:56:52,072 --> 00:56:56,699
Something happened in the city.

693
00:56:58,238 --> 00:56:59,656
It's a mess right now.

694
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:05,039
Thank you.

695
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:14,733
I heard there was a murder.

696
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:15,819
Yes.

697
00:57:16,585 --> 00:57:18,826
An outsider died at the motel.

698
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:23,380
I don't know why an outsider came to the countryside.

699
00:57:24,564 --> 00:57:27,485
Goodness, that's unfortunate.

700
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,909
You should catch the killer soon.

701
00:57:32,128 --> 00:57:36,038
The suspect is Kim Min-cheol.

702
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,400
Goodness!

703
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:42,604
Is that so?

704
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,418
Jeez.

705
00:57:48,978 --> 00:57:49,998
Hey!

706
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,573
That's crooked!

707
00:57:52,574 --> 00:57:53,594
That!

708
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:56,079
Bring me the wanted poster! Hurry!

709
00:57:56,165 --> 00:57:58,125
- Yes.
- You should put that up well.

710
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,009
See! It's wrinkled!

711
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:04,075
Jeez.

712
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,247
(Wanted for Fraud - Choi Kyung-seok (55))

713
00:58:12,854 --> 00:58:16,086
We would get a special promotion if we arrest even one guy here.

714
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,716
You should put this up well. It's wrinkled.

715
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,593
Sir, I'm sorry but I have some urgent business to take care of.

716
00:58:22,813 --> 00:58:23,833
I...

717
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:27,558
Something urgent came up.

718
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:28,989
I'll see you next time.

719
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:30,601
- I see.
- Goodbye.

720
00:58:30,602 --> 00:58:31,622
Yes, yes.

721
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:33,599
Yes.

722
00:58:34,157 --> 00:58:35,177
Take care!

723
00:58:44,623 --> 00:58:45,643
Hey.

724
00:58:45,668 --> 00:58:46,999
Bring me the evidence bag.

725
00:58:47,098 --> 00:58:48,118
Why?

726
00:58:48,123 --> 00:58:50,331
So I can send the fingerprint to forensics.

727
00:58:54,863 --> 00:58:56,637
Bring me the documents.

728
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,440
We're leaving here tonight.

729
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:05,535
Don't worry, Young-sun.

730
00:59:07,734 --> 00:59:09,512
I'll make Choi Kyung-seok back down.

731
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:13,570
He already took the religious community donations.

732
00:59:14,473 --> 00:59:16,429
There's no reason to keep him around.

733
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:18,970
Young-sun.

734
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:20,877
Just trust me.

735
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:24,489
Yes.

736
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:28,023
Things won't be hard for you from now on.

737
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:37,444
You can't forgive him, right?

738
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,226
I'm talking about Mr. Kim Min-cheol.

739
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:48,440
Kim Min-cheol...

740
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,859
For all of my life...

741
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:55,714
I won't forgive my dad.

742
00:59:57,947 --> 00:59:59,150
But you know what?

743
01:00:01,733 --> 01:00:03,833
Kim Min-cheol's a lot like my dad.

744
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,290
I think of my father when I see Kim Min-cheol.

745
01:00:11,902 --> 01:00:13,619
I really hate that.

746
01:00:18,725 --> 01:00:20,715
Once the religious community's built,

747
01:00:23,573 --> 01:00:24,839
you won't have to see him.

748
01:00:25,465 --> 01:00:26,485
Don't worry.

749
01:01:29,497 --> 01:01:30,584
Heavenly Father.

750
01:01:31,308 --> 01:01:33,181
It was once a hard path.

751
01:01:34,574 --> 01:01:37,137
But thank you for letting me go down that path with Young-sun.

752
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:44,561
Thank you once again for giving us the vision of the religious community.

753
01:01:48,232 --> 01:01:50,031
Thank you, Heavenly Father.

754
01:01:51,677 --> 01:01:55,169
Thank you for letting me meet you and the pastor to be reborn.

755
01:01:56,968 --> 01:01:59,781
The pastor saved me.

756
01:02:01,603 --> 01:02:04,561
The pastor showed up when I felt I was alone.

757
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:08,238
Even when I was fooled by a man who's like the devil,

758
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:09,570
he saved me.

759
01:02:11,135 --> 01:02:13,814
From now on, I will live only for you and the pastor.

760
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:18,801
Thank you for saving me through your disciple, the pastor.

761
01:02:21,889 --> 01:02:22,909
I love you.

762
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:39,747
Sleep well.

763
01:02:40,938 --> 01:02:41,958
Yes.

764
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,751
- You should go in too.
- Yes.

765
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:45,697
Young-sun.

766
01:02:55,218 --> 01:02:57,098
Don't leave my side, okay?

767
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:02,303
Yes.

768
01:03:04,729 --> 01:03:05,891
I'll stick next to you.

769
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:24,450
Don't do this.

770
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,898
Please don't do this for Young-sun's sake.

771
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:29,833
You shouldn't commit any more sins!

772
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:36,233
Hey.

773
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:37,282
I mean, pastor.

774
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:39,236
I have a favor to ask you.

775
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:40,719
Okay?

776
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,847
Please just leave Young-sun alone.

777
01:04:46,995 --> 01:04:48,015
I beg you.

778
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,410
Sir.

779
01:04:59,297 --> 01:05:03,119
We're all children of God.

780
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:06,963
You were briefly seduced by Satan.

781
01:05:08,273 --> 01:05:10,674
But you can come back as God's child again.

782
01:05:15,736 --> 01:05:16,756
Sir.

783
01:05:19,786 --> 01:05:22,692
I know how you lived your life.

784
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,338
The world is tough.

785
01:05:25,965 --> 01:05:28,214
You had to fight and overcome it.

786
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:32,074
That was probably the world you had to live in to survive.

787
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:35,733
I understand. I really do.

788
01:05:37,704 --> 01:05:39,988
I'm not the only one who understands you.

789
01:05:40,299 --> 01:05:42,678
Our Heavenly Father already understands too.

790
01:05:43,229 --> 01:05:46,434
You can rely on me and trust me from now on!

791
01:05:46,435 --> 01:05:47,790
You can live a happy life!

792
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,084
Leave Young-sun to me.

793
01:05:52,495 --> 01:05:54,727
That's the only way everybody can become happy.

794
01:05:55,465 --> 01:05:57,196
That's what Young-sun wants too!

795
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:04,165
Do you know that Young-sun tried to commit suicide because of you?

796
01:06:06,201 --> 01:06:10,334
There's something Young-sun confessed to me.

797
01:06:12,365 --> 01:06:16,741
"Our Heavenly Father helped me realize that I was born to be loved."

798
01:06:17,722 --> 01:06:25,845
"Could you help my brother have this hope like I did?"

799
01:06:28,303 --> 01:06:31,447
"My brother had a harder life than me."

800
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:35,596
"At one point, I resented him but now I want to give him hope."

801
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:38,188
"Even if everybody says he's a bad guy,"

802
01:06:39,297 --> 01:06:42,910
"there are still two people in this world who love him."

803
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,431
"Heavenly Father and me."

804
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:49,754
"Pastor."

805
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:54,853
"Please help my brother come into God's embrace."

806
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:08,444
Sir.

807
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:11,139
Please get up.

808
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:18,094
Just like God forgave you, I also forgive you.

809
01:07:19,773 --> 01:07:21,466
You're not a bad person, Min-cheol.

810
01:07:27,689 --> 01:07:29,526
She never said that.

811
01:07:30,558 --> 01:07:31,835
It's okay, Min-cheol.

812
01:07:32,224 --> 01:07:33,244
Please get up.

813
01:07:34,778 --> 01:07:36,059
No, that's not it.

814
01:07:39,028 --> 01:07:41,058
She never called me brother.

815
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:42,950
Pardon?

816
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:57,082
Young-sun never called me her brother in her life, you bastard.

817
01:07:58,378 --> 01:07:59,602
Do you get it now?

818
01:08:00,074 --> 01:08:02,255
How dare you make up such lies?

819
01:08:07,794 --> 01:08:09,162
Who are you, you bastard?

820
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:18,824
She called me that before.

821
01:08:19,648 --> 01:08:20,668
Damn it.

822
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:24,173
I went overboard, right?

823
01:08:25,154 --> 01:08:26,584
You found out.

824
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:28,362
You bastard.

825
01:08:28,717 --> 01:08:30,111
Have you lost your mind?

826
01:08:31,123 --> 01:08:32,223
You rat!

827
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,522
You scumbag!

828
01:08:37,682 --> 01:08:40,654
You crazy bastard! You're worse than the scam artist!

829
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:41,819
Come here!

830
01:08:41,971 --> 01:08:43,688
- Come here!
- I'm different!

831
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:58,998
Don't compare me to that scumbag, Choi Kyung-seok.

832
01:08:59,466 --> 01:09:01,142
I'm not like that man.

833

01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,284
What did you ever do for Young-sun?

836
01:09:54,355 --> 01:09:56,036
Young-sun doesn't need you!

837
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,310
What's the cause of death?

838
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:03,195
It looks like wounds from taking meth.

839
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:06,689
People show signs of hearing and seeing things.

840
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:09,991
Kim Min-cheol's in town! Hurry up and find him!

841
01:10:10,215 --> 01:10:12,434
Choi Kyung-seok might come before Kim Min-cheol.

842
01:10:12,435 --> 01:10:14,370
We will catch him tonight, no matter what.

843
01:10:16,519 --> 01:10:17,539
Was it you?

844
01:10:17,644 --> 01:10:19,051
It's the price of your sins.
