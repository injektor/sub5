1
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:12,743
(All characters, places, companies, and incidents...)

2
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:15,265
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:17,478
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:18,607
(August 30, 2018, The first encounter)

5
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:19,848
"Bring Coach Kim!"

6
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:21,191
"Shall I rip your lips off?"

7
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:23,147
"Get on a wheelchair."

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,517
I can relate to the storyline.

9
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:26,548
I'm very excited and nervous at the same time.

10
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:27,787
I'll give my all for this.

11
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:28,848
I'll do my best.

12
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,737
I think it'll all be fine as long as I do well.

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:32,170
I hope you love our drama.

14
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:34,133
(They started off by showing how determined they were.)

15
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:35,628
(November 23, 2018, The first episode)

16
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:36,710
Action.

17
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:39,955
(Sky Castle became a bigger issue every time a new episode aired.)

18
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:42,792
(The drama caused a huge sensation.)

19
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:47,550
(It recorded the highest rating among the history of cable shows.)

20
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:49,408
(Why was Sky Castle so popular?)

21
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:50,853
You're the best. I love you.

22
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:52,747
(It criticizes the reality of our country's education system.)

23
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:55,234
The only goal of education is to get the kids into university.

24
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:57,518
He got into SNU's Med School with extracurricular activities.

25
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:58,977
I'm the top student!

26
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:00,418
What's the secret behind getting good grades?

27
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,757
I'm not the one who destroys their families.

28
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:03,930
It's the parents.

29
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,227
What is the happiness and success...

30
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:11,753
that parents want for their children?

31
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:15,503
And do the children want the same?

32
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,915
(Enthusiastic veteran actors)

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,708
Don't trust yourself.

34
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,021
Kwak Mi Hyang!

35
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,491
I'll take everything.

36
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,477
(The acting was gripping and captivating.)

37
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:26,908
You just study.

38
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,222
This is a crisis.

39
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:29,531
Please.

40
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,193
Mother!

41
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,302
Mom.

42
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:38,458
Love him loads and loads.

43
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,387
Let's escape the fiery pit!

44
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:42,057
(It'll be remembered for a long time.)

45
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:43,057
Cheers.

46
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:44,442
- Cheers. - Cheers.

47
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:48,395
(Shall we go behind the scenes?)

48
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,367
Open.

49
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:51,985
(Welcome to Kwak Mi Hyang's home.)

50
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,677
Do you recognize this place?

51
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:01,334
Do you know why we're here dressed like this?

52
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:04,048
You must trust us completely.

53
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,048
Do you?

54
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,647
- Yes, I do. - Good.

55
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,118
Some have not watched it at all,

56
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,118
but no one can watch just one episode.

57
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,857
Sky Castle is the talk of the town.

58
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:14,688
That is why we prepared a very special program.

59
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,476
That's right. We go behind the scenes.

60
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,957
Will you take the risk?

61
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,068
Ms. Kim, I can take the risk.

62
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:22,167
You'd better.

63
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:23,381
I said I can.

64
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,924
(Lee Sang Min)

65
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:29,597
(Jang Seong Kyu)

66
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:33,003
(Behind the Scenes at Sky Castle. Can you take the risk?)

67
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:34,547
I just loved the drama.

68
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:36,477
I watched the premiere,

69
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:38,977
the rerun, and the second rerun. It was always on my TV.

70
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:40,718
- It is so fun. - It is.

71
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,487
For those who need something to...

72
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,917
fill in the emptiness that the drama has ended,

73
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:47,658
we invited four of the main cast.

74
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,548
Please join us.

75
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:51,827
(Totally excited)

76
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:54,152
We got to meet these people at last.

77
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:57,198
Hello, Professor Cha. Come on in.

78
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:58,968
- Professor Cha Min Hyuk. - Hello.

79
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,585
- Hello. - Take a seat.

80
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:04,408
- It's so great to meet you. - That's right.

81
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,977
Could you please greet the viewers?

82
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,848
Hi, I'm Yoon Se A, and I played Noh Seung Hye.

83
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,118
It's nice to meet you.

84
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,778
(I'll show you my other side.)

85
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,132
(Awesome Seung Hye)

86
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:16,420
Hello, I'm Kim Byung Chul, and I played Cha Min Hyuk.

87
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,957
This looks so unfamiliar.

88
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,656
Hello, I'm Soo Han's mom, Jin Jin.

89
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:25,827
I played Woo Yang Woo, Jin Jin's husband.

90
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,628
I'm Jo Jae Yun, and it's nice to meet you.

91
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,227
(The introductions got us excited.)

92
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:30,568
Nice to meet you all.

93
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,368
As an avid viewer, I feel so nervous right now.

94
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:36,408
I just don't know how I'll manage to get through this.

95
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,678
First, I'll ask if you can tell how popular the drama was.

96
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:43,017
Of course. I got calls from a lot of people that I missed.

97
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:45,678
- I see. - This drama was a gift to me.

98
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:49,188
And when I'm out frolicking in the street...

99
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:50,400
You're "out frolicking"?

100
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:53,658
Gosh, Seung Hye got us started.

101
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,548
- Keep going. - I'm worried now.

102
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:59,628
"Give me an autograph. Let's take a selfie."

103
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,197
I haven't felt this fever in a while.

104
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,188
- Right? - That's right.

105
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:05,509
(Just like in the drama)

106
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:08,408
We'll dive into all things Sky Castle...

107
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,338
which we divided into a few subjects or classes.

108
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,447
The first subject is Korean.

109
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:17,717
Do you know the four-syllable nickname your fans gave you...

110
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:19,577
My nose is running. I'm so sorry.

111
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:21,248
- I'm sniffling. - Right?

112
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:23,418
It's cold in here. Colder than you think.

113
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:24,818
- Then... - There's no heating.

114
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:25,887
It's very cold.

115
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:27,587
I'll ask you, Professor Cha.

116
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,205
When you opened the door and said...

117
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:31,042
"Honey."

118
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:33,653
(He was left alone in the house in episode 18.)

119
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:35,767
When you said, "Honey."

120
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:36,767
You sound exactly like him.

121
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,668
- You shed tears and snot. - Yes.

122
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,407
Was it because you felt cold or...

123
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:42,707
I think I had a runny nose because of the tears.

124
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,354
- It's method acting. - Right here.

125
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,207
(Snot before tears)

126
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,048
What a mess.

127
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:50,977
- We used the second take. - I see.

128
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:53,048
After the first take,

129
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,411
I wondered whether or not to blow my nose.

130
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,257
- But I didn't. - I get it.

131
00:04:57,258 --> 00:04:59,541
So the snot appeared before the tears did.

132
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:02,228
The director said that if we have a runny nose,

133
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:03,757
they'll erase it in post-production,

134
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:06,228
so he always tells us to cry all we want.

135
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,349
You took that way too literally.

136
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,694
(I'll go on trusting you.)

137
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:13,868
Professor Cha, Byung Chul, we'll start with you.

138
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:15,467
Do you know your nickname?

139
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:17,308
- What is it? - "Pacul Min Hyuk".

140
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:18,520
(Pacul Min Hyuk?)

141
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:20,263
Mercul, Mercul.

142
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:22,007
You've never heard of it.

143
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:24,447
You mashed up two separate nicknames.

144
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:25,447
Oh, dear.

145
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,918
That's a new one. "Pacul".

146
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,887
You're "Mercul Min Hyuk".

147
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:32,457
- I'm "Starlight Seung Hye". - That's right, you know.

148
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,728
I'm "Line-crosser Jin Jin".

149
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,358
- "Line-crosser Jin Jin". - Yes, "line-crosser".

150
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,728
Professor Woo?

151
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,767
- "Spine Yang Woo." - "Spine Yang Woo."

152
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:42,293
I talked about a slipped disk for seven episodes.

153
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,798
- For seven episodes... - He was bedridden.

154
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:47,538
I was always in bed or getting beaten up by Jin Jin.

155
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,458
- I hit and scolded him. - It was so rough.

156
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:52,907
Let's watch the scenes with the fantastic dialogue that...

157
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,626
got the characters their nicknames.

158
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:56,418
(The Queens' Memorable Lines)

159
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,197
Shall I rip your lips off?

160
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:59,548
- The lips. - That's it.

161
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:00,947
- Gob Mi Hyang. - That's a hit.

162
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,211
Too bad your daughter's a brat.

163
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:06,387
How dare you. Shall I rip your lips off?

164
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:07,387
(Surprised)

165
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:10,128
I heard that even the actors repeated that line on set.

166
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,471
- Yes, yes. - Yes.

167
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,697
She's not like a monster who cares only for grades.

168
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:17,172
Shall I rip your lips off? Who are you calling a monster?

169
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:18,637
She says it so well.

170
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:19,637
Gosh, that's scary.

171
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,860
What are you doing? Hey, Kwak Mi Hyang!

172
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:25,577
- Let go! - That must've hurt.

173
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:26,678
I lost a clump of hair.

174
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,961
- Did you really? - Yes.

175
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,199
Am I base? Am I?

176
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:32,642
Shall I treat you how Kwak Mi Hyang would?

177
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:34,818
The scene after that.

178
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,809
- Jin Jin's so pretty. - Don't say that name again.

179
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:39,138
- I'll rip your lips off. - The next cut.

180
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:42,358
She's pretty. She's pretty even then.

181
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,728
It's as if rose petals should fall from the sky.

182
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,298
- Like in a commercial. - Yes.

183
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:47,440
She's pretty.

184
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:49,897
Oh, Ms. Kim.

185
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:53,807
(Ms. Kim)

186
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,454
(Is she calling me?)

187
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,607
To make my daughter successful.

188
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,372
That is more important to me than anything.

189
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:04,001
I just want Woo Joo to be happy.

190
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:05,863
Don't be such a hypocrite.

191
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,618
However successful your husband is,

192
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,578
however successful you may be,

193
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:14,056
if your child's a failure, so is your life.

194
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,453
Just what a terrible thing it is that I'm doing.

195
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:20,428
- Such unfortunate circumstances. - I know.

196
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:21,781
(Suh Jin will do anything for her daughter.)

197
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:23,767
But Yeh Suh.

198
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:24,778
That's it.

199
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:30,482
I just can't give up on your life.

200
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,636
- Many moms empathized with her. - Right.

201
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:36,548
(Teacher Joo Young)

202
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:38,700
- Ms. Kim the coach. - She's here.

203
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,270
- That's her. - You must leave it to me.

204
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:44,217
- You must trust me. - She lost a lot of hair.

205
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:45,757
After that scene?

206
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:46,928
She emphasizes trust a lot.

207
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:49,959
I asked if you mean you'll take the risk, ma'am.

208
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:52,379
Yeh Suh has a fragile mentality.

209
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:55,068
Doubt and question even the problems that you know.

210
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,210
Snub and ignore everything that inhibits your success.

211
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,868
- Even if that's your mom. - This scene.

212
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:04,738
Let Hye Na into your house.

213
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:07,072
I told you to let Hye Na in.

214
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:09,224
Only the result...

215
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:12,501
will prove your worth.

216
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,918
When your parents are at their happiest,

217
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,010
- you shatter everything. - The look in her eyes.

218
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:19,807
(Tempted)

219
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,498
That is true revenge.

220
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:24,670
(The intimidating glare)

221
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:29,628
Honk, honk. I jumped out of the way at the sound of the car horn.

222
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:30,798
- "Honk Honk"? - What?

223
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,757
She's "Honk Honk Sue Lim" because of that?

224
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:35,707
Power is a virtue.

225
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,153
(Sue Lim's first day at the book club.)

226
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,596
This is an utter comedy.

227
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:43,484
This book club. Is it really what the kids want?

228
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:45,968
Are you not giving them a hard time...

229
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,888
to satisfy your own greed?

230
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,447
What? My goodness.

231
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:53,058
We should look after our kids. We should protect them.

232
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:55,288
- She provides an ideal. - Yes.

233
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:56,572
We are moms.

234
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,955
Yes. Because we're moms.

235
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,586
You will be punished.

236
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,832
I will end your malice.

237
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:09,779
Wait and see.

238
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:11,577
(She doesn't waver.)

239
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,778
- She didn't even blink. - Don't worry about such nonsense.

240
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:14,859
Don't cross the line.

241
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,247
Is she the 38th parallel? Why can't I cross?

242
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:18,977
- The 38th parallel? - Did you make that up?

243
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:21,947
- You cross the line. - It was in the script.

244
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:24,617
(Jin Jin reacts so well, so what's her famous line?)

245
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:26,087
My gosh. What's that?

246
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,457
- My gosh. - My gosh.

247
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,658
(The interrogative exclamation)

248
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:29,688
(He's envious.)

249
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:31,597
What's this about blocking messages?

250
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,028
My point exactly.

251
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,398
- "My point exactly." - My point exactly.

252
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,528
My point exactly.

253
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,097
- They're all different. - My point exactly.

254
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:40,190
- There are so many. - Different nuances.

255
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,308
My point exactly. Four fried chickens.

256
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:44,508
I want chicken. Buy me chicken.

257
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:46,529
- I'd love to shoot a commercial. - Right?

258
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:51,048
She pulled my hair so tight that my eyes slanted up like this.

259
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,613
- I could even see behind me. - I made up that part.

260
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,148
- That was improvised? - Yes.

261
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:56,501
- No way. - This too.

262
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:59,578
I can't keep my eyeballs open.

263
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:01,857
You really couldn't, could you?

264
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,798
- I really couldn't. - How did you manage?

265
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,626
The director wouldn't yell "cut", so I said that out of anger.

266
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:08,708
(Spinning around)

267
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,668
Darn it, I almost winced.

268
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,184
It's become a habit.

269
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,207
You're my precious son.

270
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,638
(Even rash Jin Jin is a mom with strong maternal instinct.)

271
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,790
Mommy...

272
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:22,663
will die without you.

273
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,759
Okay?

274
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:26,593
(I won't forget that.)

275
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,717
(Starlight Seung Hye)

276
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:32,315
- How beautiful. - The stars are shining.

277
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,580
Don't study on a night like this.

278
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:36,811
This is amazing.

279
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:38,398
It's a different world.

280
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,867
See? Isn't it a winter wonderland?

281
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:43,127
Too much attention is a problem too.

282
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:45,298
Everyone here is rich and entitled.

283
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,638
That was the only way to erase your feeling of inferiority.

284
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,038
(That's nonsense.)

285
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,837
Everyone but yourself is an enemy!

286
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,908
If you don't kill, you will be killed!

287
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,333
Do you want to die? Do you?

288
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:59,278
- He lost his voice that day. - I bet he did.

289
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,572
He started trying to be funny after that.

290
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:03,388
We were the original funny couple.

291
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,429
No.

292
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,912
Do you realize you're being overly anxious about their grades?

293
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:09,058
As they say, what kills you in the desert...

294
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,997
isn't the heat or your thirst, but your anxiety.

295
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:15,533
You should believe in them and be supportive.

296
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:18,068
Since you have no respect for the housewife,

297
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,737
you need to know how tiresome it is to prepare each meal...

298
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:22,768
- and how thankful it is to be able - I really agree with that line.

299
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,052
to eat dinner that is made with heart.

300
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,925
I'll help you realize that first.

301
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:29,598
You should only compete with yourself.

302
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:32,877
Competing with others makes you lonely.

303
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,648
I believe true success is living a life...

304
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,001
where you're not lonely.

305
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,758
- I can relate to every situation. - Do you agree?

306
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,758
Agreed.

307
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,910
(Our mom is the best!)

308
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,898
Which part was the most memorable?

309
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,058
Nothing can beat that.

310
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,127
Nothing can beat "Shall I rip your lips off?"

311
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,867
It's such a vulgar way to curse at someone.

312
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,467
It was so shocking.

313
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:54,538
But once I kept saying it, it became quite addictive.

314
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,337
I've heard a lot of people say...

315
00:11:56,338 --> 00:11:57,837
"snout" or "trap".

316
00:11:57,838 --> 00:11:59,408
But I've never heard anyone say...

317
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:00,548
"Shall I rip your lips off?"

318
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,847
I heard you guys often used that expression on set.

319
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,677
I wanted to use that expression often,

320
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:08,418
but I couldn't dare say it to my senior actors and actresses.

321
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,018
So I'd suddenly say something and say...

322
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:13,158
"Should I rip my lips off?"

323
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,658
- That's what how I'd use it. - You used it on yourself?

324
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:15,788
She used it on herself.

325
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:18,697
We joked around like this and had a fun time.

326
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:20,568
We've seen a couple of flashbacks earlier.

327
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,097
Do you remember if there were any ad-libs...

328
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:24,917
that ended up becoming popular?

329
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:27,607
I always added ad-libs to my lines.

330
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:28,737
- Always? - Yes.

331
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,207
Later on, I had to voluntarily stop saying my lines...

332
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,895
because the director would keep the camera running.

333
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,390
"Cut."

334
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,048
(Jin Hee is the best.)

335
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,524
"This is the end. Cut."

336
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,888
Do you remember the huge fight we all had?

337
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:41,987
- Yes. - The really huge fight.

338
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:45,958
Half the curse words I said during that fight were ad-libs.

339
00:12:46,488 --> 00:12:48,688
I'd love to hook you up to a dogsled...

340
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,127
and drag you about...

341
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:52,148
so your eyes flip and lips rip off.

342
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:53,227
Yes!

343
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:55,327
My line was only written until "dogsled".

344
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:57,288
After that, it was all supposed to get bleeped out.

345
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,337
I changed the lines so that they didn't sound like curse words.

346
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,508
I was originally going to say "poke your eyes out".

347
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,196
But I felt like it might get censored.

348
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,824
So I said "so your eyes flip".

349
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,370
- That's so detailed. - What's the difference?

350
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,566
- It's very detailed. - So I ended up saying...

351
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:12,617
"so your eyes flip and lips rip off".

352
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:14,264
I refined it a little.

353
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:15,888
I heard "My goodness"...

354
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,987
was written differently on the script at first.

355
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:19,018
Oh, right.

356
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,564
On the script, it read, "My goodness, goodness, goodness".

357
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:23,997
But because my character...

358
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:27,227
is very impatient, I couldn't say all that so quickly.

359
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:28,497
- Right. - So...

360
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:31,832
that's why it ended up getting shortened into "My goodness."

361
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,308
She can use that for any kind of conversation.

362
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:35,908
You can probably use it abroad.

363
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,625
I can say "My goodness" when I'm hungry.

364
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:39,577
- I can use it when I'm happy, - She's so good.

365
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:41,195
and I can use it when I'm sleepy.

366
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:43,969
- Even when you pass away. - "My goodness."

367
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,165
- She's good. - Then Professor Woo would go...

368
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:48,301
(Shut that mouth.)

369
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,938
The script would say "tongue rolling sound".

370
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,788
(He adds a gesture to the sound.)

371
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:54,888
That was part of my ad-lib.

372
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,158
The biggest ad-lib was calling her "Jin Jin".

373
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,298
- Jin Jin. - Yes.

374
00:13:58,299 --> 00:13:59,558
Jin Jin.

375
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:02,827
(He called "Jin Jin" so many times throughout the drama.)

376
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:03,848
Jin Jin.

377
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:06,412
Gosh, my back.

378
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,237
What about you two?

379
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:11,107
He did a lot of physical ad-libs.

380
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:14,380
He'd extend 1 line into about 10 lines...

381
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:18,085
by showing his actions very meticulously.

382
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:19,835
He did a lot of ad-libs with his actions.

383
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:21,706
(She suddenly starts hosting the show.)

384
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,518
(Flustered)

385
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,388
- Are you sleeping? - She's like his spokesperson.

386
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:26,487
- Yes. - Spokesperson.

387
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:29,216
There's a scene where I get dragged out of the house by my sons.

388
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:32,892
And the script only said I'll be getting dragged out...

389
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:35,367
and that I had to struggle.

390
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:38,368
And it was my job to choose how I was going to struggle.

391
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:41,337
So I had to think about those little things.

392
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,737
He'd think about which arm or leg he's going to use at what point,

393
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:46,707
and what kind of sound he's going to make.

394
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,308
- You planned all that? - No, I wasn't that meticulous.

395
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:50,418
And because of that,

396
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:53,278
I couldn't even look at him because it was so funny.

397
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,587
- Did you have to hold it in? - Of course.

398
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:57,316
I had to do my best to stop myself from laughing.

399
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,104
I'm sorry.

400
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:01,244
(He has a lot of respect for the talented actress.)

401
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,627
There's a scene...

402
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,327
that I really tried my best to get a high rating.

403
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:05,368
What was it?

404
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,528
(There's a scene where the two actresses had to fight.)

405
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,286
My gosh, let me go.

406
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:11,155
What do you think you're doing? Stop being vulgar!

407
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:12,638
This is what Jung Ah said.

408
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,408
"Na Ra, I want to make your eyes rip like this."

409
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:18,077
"Can I do that?"

410
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:19,178
So I told her to go ahead.

411
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,508
I said I'm willing to do anything...

412
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,048
for the rating.

413
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:25,755
So she actually pulled on my hair very intensely.

414
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:27,717
According to Jung Ah,

415
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,188
she pulled Na Ra's hair...

416
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,815
just enough for her eyes to slant upwards.

417
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:34,127
But she got greedy...

418
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:36,658
and held Jung Ah's hands and pulled them higher.

419
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:37,758
You pulled her hands?

420
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,779
She's the one who made her eyes rip.

421
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:43,168
She made herself look like that.

422
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:45,938
Jung Ah told me that she looked really funny...

423
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,068
close-up.

424
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:49,908
She said she wanted to rip my eyes, but she kept pulling here.

425
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:51,438
But this part doesn't do anything to my eyes.

426
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:54,741
So I asked her to start pulling from right here.

427
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,304
But she wouldn't, so I pulled her hands...

428
00:15:57,618 --> 00:15:59,538
and did this.

429
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:01,947
You fought a little back when you were young, didn't you?

430
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:03,048
Were you a bully back in high school?

431
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,558
I told you that I'm refined.

432
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,084
It's just that it all came out so naturally.

433
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:09,957
Normally, people get flustered when someone pulls on their hair.

434
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,058
- But I knew how to react. - It seemed so natural.

435
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,627
So that's why I thought...

436
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:15,398
You guys actually talk similar...

437
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,068
to the way your characters talked...

438
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,497
on screen.

439
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:20,607
We're so used to it now.

440
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:21,881
- It must feel natural. - Yes.

441
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,302
I used to be very refined.

442
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,207
- Used to be? - Yes.

443
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,431
I used to be very calm and refined,

444
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:31,143
but I became very bright after I took on the role of Jin Jin.

445
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,318
(Laughing)

446
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:36,217
Byung Chul, do you talk like Cha Min Hyuk?

447
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:38,279
No, we're not very similar.

448
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:40,827
Min Hyuk tends...

449
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:42,587
to yell a lot.

450
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:44,428
But I'm very aware of my surroundings.

451
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:46,627
Yes, he's very gentle and calm.

452
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:48,768
- He's a yes-man. - That doesn't sound good.

453
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,658
- But... Why? - No, it's nothing.

454
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,568
This is how I am.

455
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:55,337
- They'll break up soon. - You're going to break up soon.

456
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:56,707
- It won't work out. - They'll break up soon.

457
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,138
He's still in character right now.

458
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:00,337
That's why he seems so rigid.

459
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:03,339
But he's normally very gentle, and he does everything for us.

460
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,441
Now, it's time for math class.

461
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,718
Now, let's take a look...

462
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:12,223
at the highlights of Sky Castle based on numbers.

463
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,012
(Mathematics)

464
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:17,327
(As popular as it was,)

465
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,176
(Sky Castle created a lot of highlight scenes.)

466
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:24,381
(The cast showed solid acting skills.)

467
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:28,374
(The storyline reflected the issues of today.)

468
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:31,868
(And the directing was near-perfection.)

469
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:36,778
(What are the best scenes of Sky Castle?)

470
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,404
(Best likes: 11,594 likes, Episode 15: The Battle)

471
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,988
I'll rip your lips off.

472
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,448
Who are you calling a monster?

473
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:44,687
Rip what off? That's so base.

474
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,537
You vulgar woman.

475
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,357
What? "Vulgar"?

476
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,958
(They assume Yeh Suh and Se Ri were involved in Hye Na's death.)

477
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,150
Hey. Come over here, you fool.

478
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:54,468
I need to rip off your lips first.

479
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:56,268
- My gosh. - Stop it.

480
00:17:56,269 --> 00:18:00,177
(They start with a quarrel but end up getting into a fight.)

481
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,285
I felt so upset back then.

482
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:05,604
You were so amazing, Byung Chul.

483
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:08,331
- It's like you're still married. - My gosh.

484
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:11,841
I was so scared back then.

485
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:17,090
(The scene of the battle was very frightening.)

486
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:19,518
This scene.

487
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,922
(The actors and actresses really put in their all.)

488
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,506
(You're not really fighting, right?)

489
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:30,392
(Stop)

490
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:32,214
That pillow made everyone quiet.

491
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:35,568
I think we should begin with this scene.

492
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:36,781
"The Battle".

493
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:40,137
Some people even call it a dogfight.

494
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:42,377
I feel like it would've been really funny to shoot that scene.

495
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:45,748
Let's say Byung Chul and Joon Ho...

496
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,547
- are shooting a scene right now. - Yes.

497
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:51,142
We'd be behind them reacting to the scene.

498
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:52,630
We'd be lying down and saying...

499
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:54,728
- "Look at them." - Yes.

500
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:55,857
We'd be like this.

501
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,298
- "This is so fun." - They're so mischievous.

502
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,077
- "This is so fun." - "This is the best."

503
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:02,762
(They're still in the middle of shooting "The Battle".)

504
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:04,855
(This is so fun.)

505
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:07,167
This is the behind-the-scenes.

506
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:09,532
(How was the shoot of "The Battle"?)

507
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,714
(They're all nervous before the huge incident.)

508
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:18,418
("The Battle" has finally begun.)

509
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:21,788
His pushing his head onto his chest was an ad-lib.

510
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,131
(Most of the scenes were improvised.)

511
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:25,371
That hurt, didn't it?

512
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,258
He really pinched his lips.

513
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:28,399
(He may be acting, but it really hurt.)

514
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:31,798
Joon Ho, doesn't fake it.

515
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,971
(Joon Ho, doesn't fake it.)

516
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:37,609
(You can already tell how terrifying it was.)

517
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:41,743
(This is what it actually looked like on TV.)

518
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,538
(Take it off.)

519
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,107
- "Take it off." - "Take off your glasses."

520
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:46,577
- "Take off your glasses." - That was an ad-lib as well.

521
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:47,708
(They stop the shoot because the nosebleed makeup got erased.)

522
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,264
- I remember. - The nosebleed.

523
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:51,238
(Nosebleed makeup)

524
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:52,478
Hey!

525
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,549
(They act very passionately and realistically.)

526
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:58,657
(And their chemistry was just as important.)

527
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,187
It must be essential to have good chemistry.

528
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:01,239
Yes.

529
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:04,528
My gosh, what's that? That's not fighting.

530
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:05,597
That's not fighting.

531
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:06,608
(Struggling)

532
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:10,897
Jung Ah is a lot taller than me.

533
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:11,998
My goodness.

534
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:15,107
So however much I tried to grab her hair, I couldn't.

535
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:18,038
The script said we should both pull on each other's hair.

536
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,107
- And... - They were doing this.

537
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:21,607
when I got up, her hair was a complete mess.

538
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:22,821
But I never even got to pull on it.

539
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:25,177
And it turns out she tossed and turned herself.

540
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:28,117
Because her hair was so fine, she made a mess of it herself.

541
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:29,563
I really liked this line.

542
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:32,718
"You jerk! Se Ri is..."

543
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,274
- "a club MD." - MD.

544
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:37,270
You jerk!

545
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:40,228
(Se Ri is a club MD. She's into planning, marketing,)

546
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,827
(and hosting customers. She's a professional.)

547
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:45,626
(This dialogue shows how much Min Hyuk loves his daughter.)

548
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:46,937
"She's a professional!"

549
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,167
- When he said "professional", - He spat.

550
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:49,437
he spat.

551
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,437
- And we were watching them fight. - "This is so fun."

552
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:54,812
We could see his spit flying across like this.

553
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,979
(This is where they sat to watch the fight.)

554
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:01,610
(Professional)

555
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:03,866
(Take my spit.)

556
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,087
She's working so hard.

557
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,087
That's right.

558
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,927
That's how he tried to step away,

559
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:12,397
and she had to improvise by wiping her face.

560
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:14,097
We didn't do just one take.

561
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:17,097
Later on, he started to collect spit so he could spray it.

562
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:18,311
(Feeling guilty)

563
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,268
- Did you see that? You saw that. - I did.

564
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:23,837
He had to do it again.

565
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:26,031
I'm collecting spit even as we speak.

566
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:28,248
It was a lot of fun.

567
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:31,218
We just have to mention this scene.

568
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:33,917
It's the scene that kick-started the rating rush.

569
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,617
The ratings started off at 1.7 percent,

570
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:41,458
but this scene shot it straight up to 8.7 percent.

571
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:43,953
(Memorable Scenes, Episode Four, Suh Jin Goes on Her Knees)

572
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:46,327

(How the scene was shot)

574
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,167
I believe we're done talking.

575
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:53,498
Just a moment, Ms. Kim. Five minutes.

576
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:54,952
No, just one.

577
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:57,397
She's down on her knees.

578
00:21:57,739 --> 00:22:00,779
I heard that the ratings spiked at this scene.

579
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:03,367
I'm so engrossed already.

580
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:05,978
I never got to meet Ms. Kim.

581
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,292
- Is that true? - Yes.

582
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:10,071
If that were ever to happen,

583
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,545
are you willing to take that risk?

584
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:15,958
(Suh Jin agrees to do anything to get Yeh Suh into SNU's Med School.)

585
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,463
Even if a tragedy befalls like it did to Young Jae's family,

586
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:23,422
will you still accept the risk?

587
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:30,301
- I asked if you'll take the risk. - She's good.

588
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:32,493
That glare.

589
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,401
Yes. I will.

590
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:40,544
I'll take the risk. I will.

We all lie.

596
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:02,708
I heard they shot this in one take.

597
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:05,177
Everyone was so emotional at the moment.

598
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:07,478
This scene made me jittery. "What would I have said?"

599
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:09,772
I kept wondering what I'd have said.

600
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:11,737
It was so engrossing.

601
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:14,518
As a viewer who watched from episode one onward,

602
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,087
Suh Jin goes to Ms. Kim and then slaps her.

603
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:20,087
Yes.

604
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:24,198
(Suh Jin blames Joo Young for Young Jae's mom's death.)

605
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:27,397
As a viewer, I thought the story was progressing too quickly.

606
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:30,568
I thought the story was moving on way too fast.

607
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:34,238
But when Suh Jin went back and went on her knees to beg,

608
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,708
- I realized how it all fit in. - That's right.

609
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:39,739
Our director's famous for his fabulous endings.

610
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,407
He's really good at that.

611
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,448
- I believe that scene was the end. - Yes, of that episode.

612
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:46,548
Seeing Suh Jin go on her knees convinced all the viewers.

613
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:49,318
You mentioned while we were watching that clip...

614
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,488
that you never got to see Ms. Kim.

615
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:53,488
- I never did. - Me neither.

616
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,657
- This is what we want to know. - That's right.

617
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:57,275
We only texted each other.

618
00:23:57,658 --> 00:24:00,498
I text to ask if her hair's okay.

619
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:04,028
She texts back to say she's losing a lot, and it's hard on her.

620
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:06,337
I wanted to meet her but never got to.

621
00:24:06,338 --> 00:24:08,167
You haven't texted her yet either?

622
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:09,568
We have a group chat room.

623
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:11,677
I'm always nice to her because I'm scared.

624
00:24:11,678 --> 00:24:12,920
(Acting cute to survive)

625
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:15,508
Is she cold and aloof even in the chat room?

626
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:16,708
- Her? - No.

627
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,769
Our chat room is hilarious.

628
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,018
We type like we're in character,

629
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,347
and you can almost hear us talk.

630
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:24,917
- That would be fun. - For example,

631
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:27,887

632

633
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:32,157
She did such a fantastic job that I said...

634
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:34,768
"My gosh, you should send her to SNU's Med School."

635
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:38,268

(Seung Hye prepared a special meal.)

641
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:52,993
It's extra spicy.

642
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:56,462
Extra spicy.

643
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:58,907
(I want mild flavor.)

644

But when I see you suffer,

If you look into Soo Han's eyes, he's just so adorable.

649
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:16,270
He's so sweet that you just want to hug him.

650
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:21,013
To be honest, even I don't know what's right.

00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:33,506
I really don't know.

655
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:37,058
I thought my priority was to raise the kids well.

656

(Seung Hye had given up her dream.)

657
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:41,025
So I gave up on my dreams.

00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:50,907
I was just overjoyed whenever they got good grades.

660
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:53,708
(Many parents empathized with her.)

661
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,667
I'm the one to blame.

662
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,448
I think that many parents sympathized with parts of the drama.

663
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:04,357
One special scene is the one with the spicy cup noodles.

664
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:05,834
Wasn't that improvised?

665
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:08,728
The director of photography gave me the idea.

666
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,028
- Director Oh. - Really?

667
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:12,322
The script mentioned a certain brand,

668
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:14,923
but we aren't allowed to say the name.

669
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,698
- It was a good idea. - We talk about being spicy.

670
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:19,698
I just loved the idea.

671
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:23,008
Other than you, Jae Yun,

672
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:25,059
the others are still single.

673
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:29,948
It can't have been easy acting moms and dads when you're single.

674
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:31,617
Because I'm still single...

675
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:33,177
and don't have a child,

676
00:26:33,178 --> 00:26:35,587
I had strong doubts about whether...

677
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:37,417
I could honestly portray a mom.

678
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:41,297
So I told myself I'd do what my mom did for me.

679
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:44,528
When I was a child, she would scold me,

680
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:47,458
and then at night, she'd hold me in my bed.

681
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:52,097
I thought of the times when she then apologized.

682
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:53,837
I was really afraid at first.

683
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:55,268
- You were afraid? - Yes.

684
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:58,437
I was a troublemaker like Se Ri growing up.

685
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:00,833
Although I didn't go to the lengths she did,

686
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:04,548
while I was shooting the scenes where I'm out looking for her,

687
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,278
I kept seeing my own mom.

688
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,278
That's right.

689
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,788

While portraying Cha Min Hyuk,

691
00:27:11,358 --> 00:27:14,528
I wondered if I could be a better dad than he.

692
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:16,887
I found myself thinking about that.

693
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:20,798
I could see myself feeling the urges that my character did.

694
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,268
Rather than approach the kids as a parent,

695
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:26,867
I thought I should treat them as a separate individual.

696
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:28,337
Someone who isn't too connected to me.

697
00:27:28,338 --> 00:27:31,708
I thought that if I were to approach it that way,

698
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:34,940
then maybe I could make up for my lack of actual experience.

705

She didn't say a single word,

00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:57,028
but her facial expressions and the sound of her crying...

707
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,238
was enough to portray exactly how she felt.

708
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,907
That was the most memorable scene for me.

709
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:04,677
After watching that on TV, I mentioned in our chat room...

710
00:28:04,678 --> 00:28:06,597
that Jung Ah was just amazing.

711
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:10,907
The scene where I argue with Yeh Suh...

712
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:15,030
in the corridor and say, "Your dad is my dad."

713
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:18,917
Your dad is my dad.

714
00:28:18,918 --> 00:28:22,695
Professor Kang who gave you those great genes is my dad!

715
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:27,604
After that I say, "Do what you want. The milk's been spilled."

716
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:32,572
Try putting that back in the cup.

717
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:35,808
The milk's been spilled.

718
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:37,837
- Even the kids... - Aren't they amazing?

719
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:38,888
They're the best.

720
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:43,883
I remember smashing the glass and china.

721
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,475
- I think he was traumatized. - He pulls that down. Oh, dear.

722
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:49,248
- Her treasures. - For that,

723
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:52,521
I had to pull it down and break everything in one go.

724
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:55,157
- That's my most memorable scene. - There's no second take.

725
00:28:55,158 --> 00:28:56,673
We had just one shot.

726
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,819
- It was dangerous. - Hey!

727
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:01,568
You 60-percent fool broke all these expensive plates!

728
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:03,167
How dare you when you're so dumb?

729
00:29:03,168 --> 00:29:04,380
He looks scared.

730
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:07,397
I lock horns a lot with my dad.

731
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:10,738
There's a scene where I cry and plead with him.

732
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:14,374
You made me think that only kids who get good grades are worthwhile!

733
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:17,536
There's a scene where Yoon Se A screams.

734
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,146
(Seung Hye's furious with Min Hyuk)

735
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:25,145
- Hey! - Wow.

736
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,887
It was like she was a real mom.

737
00:29:27,888 --> 00:29:30,488
I felt like we were a real family.

738
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:31,758
- That kid. - At that moment.

739
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,274
Don't touch my daughter.

740
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:37,468
It was the day I smashed the pyramid.

741
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:40,427
The pyramid scene we did with Dad.

742
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:43,008
We'll only film your torso.

743
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:45,361
Why is... Is this when I say my line?

744
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:47,094
Why is the world a pyramid?

745
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:48,448
Earth is round.

746
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:50,499
- I loved that line. - Me too.

747
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:54,268
(My precious pyramid)

748
00:29:55,688 --> 00:29:57,587
(Ki Joon rebels and smashes the pyramid.)

749
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,103
Why is the world a pyramid?

750
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:01,949
Earth is round. Why is the world a pyramid?

751
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:05,528
To us, that pyramid...

752
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:08,268
symbolized all sorts of pressure.

753
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:11,937
I was given a chance to break that.

754
00:30:11,938 --> 00:30:14,337
I was so grateful and I had fun shooting that scene.

755
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:17,398
I thought it was a very important scene.

756
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:21,037
Fortunately, our dad helped us through it.

757
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:22,808
We managed well.

758
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:24,577
What are you doing? Let go.

759
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:27,478
(The special scenes were full of fun and energy.)

760
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,932
That was great.

761
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:32,218
We watched it all before, but it's still amazing.

762
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:33,917
- I still get sucked in. - Right.

763
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:36,357
He got kicked out. What happened next?

764
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:37,958
I found out in the drama.

765
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,558
He went outside and opened the garage door.

766
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,927
He did everything he could to get back into the house.

767
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:47,080
(Min Hyuk desperately wants to get back indoors.)

768
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:49,437
The director gave me the idea.

769
00:30:49,438 --> 00:30:50,852
You want to be funny.

770
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:52,677
I can tell you now that...

771
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:55,577
over half of my character came from the editing...

772
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:58,218
and music that was added in post-production.

773
00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:00,147
- What? - Hang on.

774
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:02,512
Are you up to something right now?

775
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:03,748
What's going on?

776
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:04,869
Who is this cute person?

777
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:06,687
She just said "Who is this cute person?"

778
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:07,927
They're still like a married couple.

779
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:09,187
- My gosh. - Goodness.

780
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:10,327
I have so much to say.

781
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:13,127
I feel like we should shoot 12 episodes of this.

782
00:31:13,128 --> 00:31:14,597
(Laughing)

783
00:31:14,598 --> 00:31:16,798
The behind-the-scenes of Sky Castle.

784
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,337
- 12 episodes? - Should we do it?

785
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:19,498
Exactly.

786
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:20,937
Let's shoot 12 episodes of it.

787
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:23,208
- We can't end it with just one. - Exactly.

788
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:24,955
We should use the same background music.

789
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,478
The popularity of Sky Castle...

790
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:29,772
created a whole new kind of sensation...

791
00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:32,099
on the internet.

792
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,518
(Sky Castle)

793
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,609
It became the most searched word on the web.

794
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:40,083
It even made people come up with a new term called "Castlers".

795
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,706
And it even appeared on the news.

796
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:44,975
This is a very popular drama these days.

797
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:47,897
This popular drama shows the obsessiveness...

798
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:49,283
of private education among the upper class...

799
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:52,198
It brought about a lot of analyzations and controversies...

800
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,998
and caused a huge social issue.

801
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,137
(A lot of contents analyzed the drama in many different ways.)

802
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:56,268
- It even appeared on the news? - Really?

803
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:57,407
(Students from SNU made a video about it.)

804
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:59,560
(And even psychiatrists tried to analyze the characters.)

805
00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:02,200
SNU's Med School graduates made a lot of contents.

806
00:32:02,348 --> 00:32:04,107
It didn't end there. So many people even made parodies...

807
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:05,718
which shows how popular the drama was.

808
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:07,147
We will now share the videos...

809
00:32:07,148 --> 00:32:09,310
that stirred up the internet.

810
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:10,701
(Who are you?)

811
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:13,950
("Men on a Mission" also did a parody of Coach Kim.)

812
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,098
(Scared)

813
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:17,288
(I asked if you can handle it.)

814
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:18,397
He's so good.

815
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:19,857
(Coach Kim looks a lot different under the bright light.)

816
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:21,768
(Sky Castle was popular among many celebrities.)

817
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:22,768
He's good.

818
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:24,468
- I just got goosebumps. - The one on the right is Yoo Ah In.

819
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:25,498
- I got goosebumps. - What?

820
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:27,498
Ho Dong is dressed as Yoo Ah In from "Veteran".

821
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:29,185
(She's weak-minded.)

822
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:34,318
(Bada made a music video of "We All Lie".)

823
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:37,677
(She even reenacted Kim Joo Young's appearance.)

824
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:38,948
Bada, the singer,

825
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:41,318
even made a music video of "We All Lie".

826
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,561
(She even reenacted Kim Joo Young's appearance.)

827
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:46,591
(Don't I look similar?)

828
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:54,090
(Each celebrity made a parody video according to their individualities.)

829
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:57,167
(The comedian, Kim Ki Soo, did a makeup tutorial on Kim Joo Young.)

830
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:58,987
Can you fully trust me?

831
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,381
We all lie

832
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,690
(Makeup tutorials were as popular as the parody videos.)

833
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:06,011
I'm going to try putting makeup on like Kim Seo Hyung.

834
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:07,238
(Coach Kim's Grim Reaper Makeup)

835
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:08,662
These are Kim Seo Hyung's eyebrows.

836
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:10,778
Makeup youtubers were mainly focused...

837
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:13,202
on Coach Kim's Grim Reaper Makeup.

838
00:33:14,418 --> 00:33:15,617
Are you threatening me?

839
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,083
You must fully trust my makeup.

840
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:19,904
This part is important.

841
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:27,228
(Due to the popularity of the drama...)

842
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:29,867
A famous Youtuber, Korea Grandma, also transformed herself...

843
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:30,998
into Kim Joo Young.

844
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:34,332
Coach Kim, do you think my kid can become a mukbang youtuber?

845
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,808
She made a lot of people laugh by pretending to be...

846
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:37,937
a mukbang youtuber coach.

847
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:39,808
Eat a lot. Only think about yourself.

848
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,929
Just think about mukbangs. Eat up.

849
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:43,220
Keep eating.

850
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:44,995
Cut the nonsense, and shut your mouth.

851
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,347
Grandma, I can't eat anymore.

852
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:48,136
You punk, you already finished everything.

853
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:52,381
- I told you to order jokbal. - She's a very famous youtuber.

854
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:54,752
On top of that, people even created webcomics.

855
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,657
There are those who rule and those who are ruled over.

856
00:33:57,658 --> 00:33:59,897
Those who give orders and those who obey.

857
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:01,313
- They drew it really well. - That's good.

858
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:03,345
- My gosh. - She looks so similar.

859
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,758
- Shall I rip your lips off? - Goodness.

860
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,637
("What goes around, comes around.")

861
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:12,377
And the most popular kind of video that people created the most...

862
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:13,607
were impersonations.

863
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:15,668
Let's see how similar they sound.

864
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:19,050
Ma'am, you must put this tree in your house.

865
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,634
You want to bring that tree into our house?

866
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,087
Mom, do you think that makes any sense?

867
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:25,209
If my grades go down, it's all your fault.

868
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:28,419
You must fully trust Rudolph, ma'am.

869
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:31,057
Shall I rip your lips off?

870
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:32,876
Why hold a party?

871
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,528
What's the use of being the top student...

872
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:37,216
when she's as rude as anyone can be?

873
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,767
When do you want the surgery?

874
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:40,497
What do you think about...

875
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:43,134
asking Professor Cha, your neighbor?

876
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:45,107
(This is an impersonation of Woo Yang Woo dancing...)

877
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:46,623
(when he's suffering from a herniated disk.)

878
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:48,877
Jin Jin.

879
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,647
My goodness.

880
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,537
That's exactly my point.

881
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,087
If you want to climb to the top of the ladder...

882
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:57,613
How am I going to eat those green onions? They're not cooked.

883
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,172
It's green onion soup.

884
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,417
Green onion soup.

885
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:03,409
Since you have no respect for the housewife...

886
00:35:03,628 --> 00:35:05,158
I'll help you realize that first.

887
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,169
What?

888
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:08,167
Shall I rip your lips off?

889
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,298
(This is so funny.)

890
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:10,914
The drama may have ended,

891
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:14,095
but the parodies will continue...

892
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:15,651
forever.

893
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:18,738
- That was fun. - How nice.

894
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:20,837
Have you seen any of those videos?

895
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:21,908
I saw the one made by the dubbing artist.

896
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:23,508
- Yes, me too. - She did a lot of impersonations.

897
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:25,417
It was my first time seeing the other videos.

898
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:26,917
- Aren't they fun? - They really are.

899
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,787
- I only showed you a little. - They're incredible.

900
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:30,187
- There are so many. - There are a lot more.

901
00:35:30,188 --> 00:35:31,247
There are so many.

902
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,818
Byung Chul, can you impersonate any of the other...

903
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:35,546
actors or actresses on the show?

904
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:37,940
Well...

905
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,246
He needs to gather energy...

906
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:44,452
- starting from his joints. - Sorry for putting you on the spot.

907
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,809
(He can't wait to hear it.)

908
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:48,120
"Rip what off?"

909
00:35:48,308 --> 00:35:49,868
There's a scene where I say that.

910
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:51,437
I'll rip your lips off.

911
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:53,607
Rip what off? That's so base.

912
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:55,528
You vulgar woman.

913
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,093
He talks with a tune.

914
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,417
"Cha Suh Joon. Cha Ki Joon."

915
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,687
He talks with a tune like this.

916
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:02,948
I should've learned that.

917
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:04,301
You're very detailed.

918
00:36:04,518 --> 00:36:05,871
Cha Suh Joon.

919
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:09,740
Cha Ki Joon.

920
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:14,727
My character did a lot of impersonations in the drama.

921
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:17,068
And the director kept wanting more...

922
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:19,638
and eventually asked me to try impersonating Cha Min Hyuk.

923
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:23,207
But because he's a guy, it was really hard to sound similar.

924
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:25,834
- What was the line? - "You cannot escape the pyramid..."

925
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:28,178
"You cannot escape..."

926
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:29,707
No, this isn't right.

927
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:30,778
- It's hard. - It's hard.

928
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:32,017
He's shaking his head.

929
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:33,977
- As long as you live in this world. - Can you show us?

930
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:35,747
"As long as you live in this world."

931
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:36,848
That's how he talks.

932
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,605
"As long as you live in this world."

933
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:39,888
I can't say it like that.

934
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:41,118
That's why you did this.

935
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,280
Yes, that's why I just did this.

936
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:45,276
"You cannot escape the pyramid..."

937
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:48,399
"as long as you live in this world."

938
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:50,751
- Yes, this is what I did. - It was a great scene.

939
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,755
Why is that a great scene?

940
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:54,298
(Professor Cha gets worked up for the first time.)

941
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,738
A lot of people said I looked like you.

942
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,556
You guys keep talking nonsense.

943
00:36:57,668 --> 00:37:00,278
Is there anything special when it comes...

944
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:01,794
to impersonating Jin Jin Hee?

945
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:04,147
My character talks with a rhythm.

946
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:07,318
"That's exactly my point."

947
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,718
You need to flip the sound a little.

948
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,789
- "That's exactly my point." - "That's exactly my point."

949
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:14,237
- You're scary. - "That's exactly my point."

950
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:15,944
Four chickens.

951
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,198
- I can impersonate Sue Lim. - She's really good.

952
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,410
"I let Woo Joo..."

953
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:23,568
"take private math lessons because he wanted to."

954
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,285
"But I never made him do anything else."

955
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:26,868
(She sounds just like Lee Sue Lim.)

956
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,138
Now, it's time for Yeh Bin.

957
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,178
You're good.

958
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:33,675
"My mom doesn't even know why I ran away from home."

959
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:36,790
My gosh.

960
00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:39,147
You're so good.

961
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:41,846
- My goodness. - You're incredible.

962
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:43,747
The fans of Sky Castle...

963
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:46,041
made so many speculations.

964
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,658
And we're here to resolve all of your curiosities.

965
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:50,406
Yes, first of all,

966
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:53,627
I'm sure you all want to know how they are in real-life on set.

967
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:55,828
So we secretly received a report...

968
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:57,617
behind their backs.

969
00:37:57,898 --> 00:38:00,191
Here's the first question asked by one of the viewers.

970
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:04,204
"Is Seung Hye and Min Hyuk actually dating in real-life?"

971
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:05,707
- Don't be flustered. - Look at his face.

972
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,194
If your face turns red, that's a yes.

973
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,324
If your face turns red, that's a yes.

974
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:12,377
I really want to say something.

975
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:13,377
(What are you trying to say?)

976
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,448
(Zip your mouth.)

977
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:15,818
- I should keep my mouth shut. - Yes.

978
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:17,869
- Why? - You don't need to.

979
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:19,318
- Can I say it? - Sure.

980
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,517
- Really? - What is it?

981
00:38:20,518 --> 00:38:21,771
It's nothing much.

982
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:23,787
Byung Chul and I are friends.

983
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:26,528
And I could see that his heart was fluttering at times.

984
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:28,689
- We'd joke about it sometimes. - Don't get swayed.

985
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:30,428
They have such great chemistry.

986
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:32,698
- The way they look at each other... - They seem so loving.

987
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:33,837
is so cute.

988
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,201
So I went up to Byung Chul and asked "What do you think about Se Ah?"

989
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:39,178
I asked him what he thought about her.

990
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:40,678
And with that exact smile on his face...

991
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:43,332
- He smiled like that and said... - He always smiles like this.

992
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,424
- It's not something he does for me. - He smiles at you sometimes.

993
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:46,759
He smiled at me and said,

994
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:50,723
"I'd love to date her."

995
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:52,330
(Shocking news)

996
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:55,087
- We want you guys to date. - We really do.

997
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,528
(Now, all that's left is Se Ah's answer.)

998
00:38:56,529 --> 00:38:57,568
(What will she say?)

999
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:00,763
He said, "I'd love to date her."

1000
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:02,309
(Shocking news)

1001
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,809
- We want you guys to date. - We really do.

1002
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,949
(Now, all that's left is Se Ah's answer.)

1003
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,079
(What will she say?)

1004
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,749
But before she answers,

1005
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,325
let's take a look at video footage first.

1006
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,405
I guess something happened between them.

1007
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:16,958
(Awkward)

1008
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,898
- Hello. - Hello.

1009
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:19,999
(It was the first day of the table-read.)

1010
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,728
I'm Kim Byung Chul, and my character...

1011
00:39:21,729 --> 00:39:23,499
in Sky Castle is Cha Min Hyuk.

1012
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,186
I'm Yoon Se Ah, and my character is Noh Seung Hye.

1013
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:27,721
I hope you all love the drama.

1014
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,856
- I hope you love it. - Please watch our drama.

1015
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,924
Try being cuter.

1016
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,249
(He acts cute.)

1017
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,008
(They already seemed pretty close starting from this day.)

1018
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,767
You're very good.

1019
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:42,449
The making film?

1020
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,489
Min Hyuk's shoulders are so broad.

1021
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,619
It's different.

1022
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,758
(Min Hyuk is embarrassed.)

1023
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:48,870
Isn't he cute?

1024
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,848
(Isn't he cute?)

1025
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,059
This is a long time ago. It's when we first started shooting.

1026
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,829
- Yes, it's during the beginning. - She's following him.

1027
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,133
You normally follow someone's behavior when you're in love.

1028
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,186
Can I talk more casually with you?

1029
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,068
Haven't you already started doing that?

1030
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,989
I thought you did that a while ago.

1031
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,579
Your lips look like my dad's.

1032
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,648
- Really? - Yes.

1033
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:09,809
Was she making a joke?

1034
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,818
I think she really meant what she said.

1035
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:15,048
I did that?

1036
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:16,535
(She touches his lips.)

1037
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,918
(Are they really in love?)

1038
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,128
- People say you're so handsome. - Did I touch his lips?

1039
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,329
I think so.

1040
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,699
- Do you not think so? - No.

1041
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,699
- Do you want to take a photo? - A photo?

1042
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,892
- I'd be honored. - Let's do it.

1043
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,795
Those two are not there to work.

1044
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:34,699
(Lovey-dovey)

1045
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,628
They went there to play.

1046
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:39,302
(Love is in the air.)

1047
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,934
(Sky Castle, Cha Min Hyuk, Noh Seung Hye...)

1048
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,278
(Slapping)

1049
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:45,179
(He needs to hide his handsomeness.)

1050
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,679
Oh, is that what it meant?

1051
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,134
(He makes sure she's warm.)

1052
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,062
There's something going on.

1053
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:54,244
(Even when the entire cast is present,)

1054
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,915
(she doesn't hesitate to show him affection.)

1055
00:40:57,229 --> 00:40:58,329
Did you kiss him?

1056
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,528
- I did? - You did.

1057
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:00,843
I kissed him?

1058
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:03,869
What is going on?

1059
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,438
Do you call each other?

1060
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:09,105
We were filming on my birthday.

1061
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:13,349
He changed our vault password to my birthdate.

1062
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:14,722
What?

1063
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,249
Hold on.

1064
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,119
It was 0101.

1065
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,219
I guess he was feeling pressured.

1066
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,543
He called me to congratulate.

1067
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,918
So I said, "Sing a song for me."

1068
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,559
- And... - No way.

1069
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,829
He didn't hesitate for a second and sang for me.

1070
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,228
(Her heart's fluttering.)

1071
00:41:34,229 --> 00:41:35,269
At that time,

1072
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,539
- Look at him. - my friends were at my place.

1073
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,969
- So... - Did they hear him?

1074
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,848
Yes. And he asked, "Were you not alone?"

1075
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,179
Anyway, I loved it.

1076
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,338
- It's so romantic. - I know.

1077
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,338
Goodness.

1078
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,784
- Happy Birthday to you - It was heartwarming.

1079
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,849
I'm curious about his tone.

1080
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,849
Happy Birthday, dear Se A

1081
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,435
- Of course. - I said that.

1082
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:59,418
I think I said, "dear Yoon Se A".

1083
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:01,843
- How romantic. - Why my surname?

1084
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,188
- I can't remember. - We're not strangers.

1085
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:04,341
Anyway...

1086
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,929
(Someone please stop her.)

1087
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,298
As a fellow man in his 40s,

1088
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:12,099
being able to sing that song for someone right away...

1089
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,568
- is not easy at all. - Right.

1090
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:15,769
I feel like we could expect some good news...

1091
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,921
from them.

1092
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,230
(These two showed great chemistry as a married couple.)

1093
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:24,136
(We hope to receive some good news soon.)

1094
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:26,719
This one was given to us...

1095
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,249
by one of the cast members.

1096
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,159
Apparently, there is an alien among the cast.

1097
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,412
Let's find out.

1098
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:39,082
I think my mom is an alien.

1099
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,194
- I'm an alien? - She's an alien.

1100
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:47,084
She is strong and has a loud voice.

1101
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:50,208
And when she lifted her hair, her left ear was missing.

1102
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:52,478
That's why I think she's an alien.

1103
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:53,519
Oh, my.

1104
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,902
(Soo Han, take a better look at it.)

1105
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,667
(Do you see my ear?)

1106
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,318
I didn't see it.

1107
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,449
(Let us check.)

1108
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,560
Woo Soo Han!

1109
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:04,318
(Afraid)

1110
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,874
I had a nightmare!

1111
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:07,970
Just go to bed!

1112
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:09,573
It's important!

1113
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:11,003
(Laughing)

1114
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:12,329
Good!

1115
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,798
- I knew you'd be funny. - They're hilarious.

1116
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,819
Is that more important than me?

1117
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:17,628
It is!

1118
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:18,798
(She sure does have a loud voice.)

1119
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:19,910
She's so loud.

1120
00:43:19,939 --> 00:43:21,699
She's already checking how to enter.

1121
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,558
(She checks her position.)

1122
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:25,909
Your body...

1123
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,758
is our body.

1124
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,769
It hurts.

1125
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,349
(Now, we will reveal her charms.)

1126
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,239
I can actually hear the sounds.

1127
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,588
- This wasn't planned. - Goodness.

1128
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:38,818
Tell someone else to do it.

1129
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,758
It's not easy for a woman to hit like that.

1130
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:42,528
- She did this. - It hurts.

1131
00:43:42,529 --> 00:43:43,803
How dare you?

1132
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:46,528
I thought those sounds were edited in.

1133
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:47,798
She hits well.

1134
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,228
(You hit well.)

1135
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:51,228
- Maybe she learned boxing. - Right?

1136
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:54,703
You're really good. Did you learn boxing?

1137
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,108
Did you learn?

1138
00:43:56,109 --> 00:43:57,838
Tell us if you did.

1139
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,008
I didn't.

1140
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:00,393
(Embarrassed)

1141
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,579
She looks so frail. Oh, my.

1142
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,822
(That's a full swing.)

1143
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:06,278
Okay?

1144
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:08,249
I didn't know I hit you that much.

1145
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,548
You little...

1146
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:11,307
(She also harasses them with props.)

1147
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:14,758
(Laughing)

1148
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:16,929
- Goodness. - Does she always do that?

1149
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,188
(She runs well in her high heels.)

1150
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,329
(She runs like Usain Bolt...)

1151
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,958
(in her high heels.)

1152
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:23,354
- Wait for me. - You're very agile.

1153
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,139
Isn't it difficult to run that much in high heels?

1154
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,988
(She keeps running.)

1155
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,654
She could be an alien.

1156
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,500
I think she is an alien.

1157
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,755
(Worried)

1158
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:35,920
What should I do?

1159
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:39,108
(You will still adore me, right?)

1160
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:41,219
She looks so lovable.

1161
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,503
(She is an adorable alien.)

1162
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,219
No matter how much she hits you, you won't be able to hate her.

1163
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,719
I said something that wasn't planned,

1164
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,659
and it was, "You're pretty."

1165
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,099
Your testimony is very different from your son's.

1166
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,321
He called her an alien.

1167
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:58,199
But you think she's beautiful.

1168
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,139
Thanks to him, it helped describe our couple.

1169
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,369
Before then, I was just a wife...

1170
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,639
who was always scolding her husband.

1171
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,809
But after his line,

1172
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,079
- people started to love us. - Right.

1173
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,119
- Thank you. - Just watching the footage,

1174
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,048
I can see that you guys filmed in a friendly atmosphere.

1175
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:15,318
How was it?

1176
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:16,588
It was even better than that.

1177
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,688
You guys just saw the tip of the iceberg.

1178
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:20,134
- Right. - It was so fun.

1179
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,829
Oh, no, your back. Oh, no.

1180
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,203
That's good.

1181
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,953
She's really beautiful.

1182
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,599
You went to Anyang Arts High? I went to Kaywon High.

1183
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,064
- Suh Joon went to Anyang. - I used to live there.

1184
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,953
Where?

1185
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,869
Step over me.

1186
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,121
Don't!

1187
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,331
(I will protect my daughter.)

1188
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:43,376
(Behind the camera, she is mischievous.)

1189
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:46,849
(Joo Young, will you take responsibility?)

1190
00:45:47,419 --> 00:45:49,975
(They look very friendly.)

1191
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,843
- Come here. - It's okay.

1192
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,758
- It's all right. - Wear it.

1193
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:57,159
You could catch a cold.

1194
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,857
Just wear it, you punk!

1195
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:06,485
(Teamwork is the secret to their success.)

1196
00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:08,969
They gave me heat packs when it was cold...

1197
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,736
and even gave me a blanket as a present.

1198
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:13,119
Also,

1199
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,679
when I struggled with acting,

1200
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,215
they would help me by giving advice.

1201
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,872
I really like them.

1202
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,449
I joined the team late,

1203
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,989
so for me, it was awkward.

1204
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,559
They approached me first...

1205
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,489
and asked whether or not I had eaten yet.

1206
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,628
I really loved them.

1207
00:46:32,629 --> 00:46:36,608
It truly felt like I was their daughter.

1208
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:38,488
It was heartwarming.

1209
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:43,653
He bought me food often.

1210
00:46:43,669 --> 00:46:45,409
He really did.

1211
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,208
There is a Chinese restaurant nearby,

1212
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:49,949
and he bought me various dishes.

1213
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:54,019
Every time our family eats, he's the one who pays.

1214
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,949
My entire family,

1215
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,059
my father, mother,

1216
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,988
Ki Joon, and Se Ri...

1217
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,526
all grew on me.

1218
00:47:06,029 --> 00:47:08,228
This is our last shooting,

1219
00:47:08,229 --> 00:47:11,401
and I think it'll be very difficult to say goodbye.

1220
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:14,168
My goodness. He doesn't say things like that.

1221
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:15,927
- Right? - He just left that day.

1222
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:19,039
It's touching when those who don't usually express things do it.

1223
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,438
- You're already tearing up. - I know.

1224
00:47:20,439 --> 00:47:22,398
Say something to your kids.

1225
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,418
First, I'd like to say something to our oldest kid, Suh Joon.

1226
00:47:26,419 --> 00:47:27,449
(He's the eldest?)

1227
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,036
Wake up!

1228
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,489
You're rock bottom. You get zero points.

1229
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,964
He loves our daughter as if she's our baby.

1230
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,329
Se Ri!

1231
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,401
(Don't misunderstand.)

1232
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,811
(These two love each other like real father and daughter.)

1233
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,398
To our daughter.

1234
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:47,699
You truly did a good job expressing such complex feelings.

1235
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,039
You did so well...

1236
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,409
that we were so proud of you while watching.

1237
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,954
Suh Joon.

1238
00:47:53,709 --> 00:47:55,770
You said it'd be hard to say goodbye.

1239
00:47:55,879 --> 00:47:59,818
But I'm glad it seemed like it wasn't too hard.

1240
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:02,548
And Ki Joon.

1241
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,389
You are so cheerful and funny.

1242
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:07,619
Also, your acting had the depth which isn't common...

1243
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,710
in kids your age.

1244
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:12,258
I hope we all stay in touch.

1245
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:13,573
Good work, guys.

1246
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,128
(Everyone is touched.)

1247
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:17,168
He's such a gentleman, right?

1248
00:48:17,169 --> 00:48:19,338
- Should I say something too? - Sure.

1249
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:21,562
- Make it short, please. - All right.

1250
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,309
Dear Soo Han.

1251
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,778
I'm going to cry.

1252
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,496
Me too.

1253
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,148
This was your first project.

1254
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:33,544
You did a terrific job.

1255
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,618
It was so touching when you said...

1256
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,789
that I felt more like your mom than your actual mom.

1257
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,219
- His mother will be watching this. - My goodness.

1258
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,228
- Oh, no! - We're sorry, ma'am.

1259
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:46,329
- Sorry, ma'am. - We're sorry.

1260
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,219
- I'm sorry for tearing up. - That's what he said.

1261
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,592
It's probably a temporary emotion that he felt at that time.

1262
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,239
Since you've become well known through Sky Castle,

1263
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,208
I'm pretty sure that you will get more work.

1264
00:48:57,209 --> 00:48:59,938
I hope we meet again once you become a fantastic actor.

1265
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:02,309
Next time we meet, instead of meeting as mother and son,

1266
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:06,449
let's meet as an older sister and her younger brother.

1267
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,773
I had such a great time, and you did so well.

1268
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:10,434
(He is proud.)

1269
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,789
If teamwork was the secret to a successful production,

1270
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:17,358
the secret to the drama's success was that it stimulated...

1271
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,898
the viewers to deduce certain things.

1272
00:49:19,899 --> 00:49:21,628
Several scenes and props...

1273
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:25,099
encouraged the viewers to analyze and infer.

1274
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,856
Here they are.

1275
00:49:27,899 --> 00:49:30,568
Castlers analyzed the characters' actions, lines,

1276
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:34,176
and even the props while they waited for the next episode.

1277
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,508
Why is this world a pyramid?

1278
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:38,478
Their inferences came second only to that of Sherlock Holmes.

1279
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:40,499
Let's look at some of them.

1280
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:45,318
First one was the apple.

1281
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:46,659
- The apple? - Right.

1282
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,119
- What could it be? - What is it?

1283
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,789
Castlers claimed...

1284
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,930
that the director's intention was hidden in this scene.

1285
00:49:56,299 --> 00:49:57,769
They compared the apple...

1286
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,527
to the fruit of knowledge in the Bible.

1287
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,139
They predicted that...

1288
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,708
Hye Na will meet the same fate as Adam...

1289
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:08,022
after eating the apple.

1290
00:50:09,979 --> 00:50:11,909
Castlers predicted Hye Na's death...

1291
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,449
through the apple she bit.

1292
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:18,157
(They predicted her death through the apple.)

1293
00:50:19,689 --> 00:50:20,989
(Shocked)

1294
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,088
This was...

1295
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:23,728
Wasn't the ending amazing?

1296
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,188
- It shocked me so much. - That was the end.

1297
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,310
I was shocked to the bone.

1298
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:30,969
There was another scene that caused a controversy.

1299
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,869
It was the dragonfly.

1300
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,011
(Their second deduction came from the dragonfly.)

1301
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:36,409
Coming in second is something to be proud of as well.

1302
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,139
Hye Na loses to Yeh Suh in an unfair battle...

1303
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,838
and cannot accept the result.

1304
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:44,515
(Hye Na suspects Yeh Suh of cheating.)

1305
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,474
Enraged, she heads somewhere.

1306
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,280
A dead dragonfly was found in Hye Na's place.

1307
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:54,119
(- Is Hye Na going to die? - What does this mean?)

1308
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,458
Castlers talked about how dragonflies are born...

1309
00:50:57,459 --> 00:51:00,591
in the summer and die in the fall.

1310
00:51:01,029 --> 00:51:04,429
They suspected Hye Na's death once again.

1311
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,838
(This wasn't the first time a dragonfly was spotted.)

1312
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,879
This wasn't the first time a dragonfly appeared.

1313
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:12,168
(A dragonfly was found on a teapot.)

1314
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,508
Before Hye Na's death,

1315
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:16,539
a dragonfly was spotted on Suh Jin's teapot.

1316
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:23,048
Also, Suh Jin's sandglass was analyzed by them.

1317
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:24,818
(The sandglass seemed to be significant.)

1318
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:27,344
They believed this was a foreshadowing...

1319
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:31,397
of someone's death after some time had passed.

1320
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,373
Were all these hints...

1321
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:39,198
foreshadowings intended by the director?

1322
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,406
The truth will be revealed soon.

1323
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:48,079
They inferred all that. That's fascinating.

1324
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,208
Isn't it?

1325
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:51,775
We infer many things together.

1326
00:51:52,149 --> 00:51:54,219
This isn't something you can guess at once.

1327
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,949
- They watched it several times. - Castlers?

1328
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,233
They're amazing.

1329
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,338
They need to be applauded. Thank you.

1330
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,429
Actually, there was a spoiler for the ending.

1331
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,641
It was very detailed.

1332
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,959
Which one of those deductions did you think...

1333
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,929
was baffling?

1334
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,429
I had one.

1335
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,823
There were rumors that I was going to die,

1336
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,469
and that Soo Han would die.

1337
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,608
It was a scene where I was hugging him.

1338
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:21,139
Our family photo appeared,

1339
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,210
and his face was blackened.

1340
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,723
The light didn't shine there.

1341
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,679
Because they couldn't see his face, they believed...

1342
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,902
that he would die.

1343
00:52:30,419 --> 00:52:31,789
They suspect every single detail.

1344
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:34,588
And they said I'd die because I knew...

1345
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:36,043
Suh Jin's secret.

1346
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,329
- Goodness. - It was baffling.

1347
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,724
Is it because you talked a lot?

1348
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,429
- So they killed me. - Oh, my.

1349
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,681
Someone asked me,

1350
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,113
"It's the history teacher, right?"

1351
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,068
(That's original.)

1352
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:50,342
I had to remember who the history teacher was.

1353
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:56,561
(The history teacher had strife with Hye Na.)

1354
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,648
Chairman of the board's niece.

1355
00:52:58,649 --> 00:53:00,195
(What? I'm the culprit?)

1356
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,619
Since we didn't know who the culprit was,

1357
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,349
- we had a debate as well. - Sure.

1358
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,289
At Suh Jin's place,

1359
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:09,559
there is a helper named Kang Young Sook.

1360
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,188
Usually, the other helpers don't have...

1361
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,298
- specific names. - Right.

1362
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:17,027
But that woman had one.

1363
00:53:17,399 --> 00:53:19,298
- I see. - So we thought it was her.

1364
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:21,568
(She was a candidate.)

1365
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:26,085
(She also had strife with Hye Na.)

1366
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,579
Get out.

1367
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,739
Get out now!

1368
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,749
(I'm innocent!)

1369
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,309
- I thought she was it. - Right.

1370
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,309
Right.

1371
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,548
She also gave Hye Na...

1372
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:35,249
- a hard time. - Right.

1373
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,989
So we thought she had something,

1374
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,989
and that she killed her.

1375
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,676
- You guys did? - Yes.

1376
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:47,298
It was the director's intention to make everyone...

1377
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:48,999
try to guess and deduct things...

1378
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,728
from these scenes.

1379
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,039
We will reveal it to you.

1380
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,180
- Really? - What was...

1381
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,068
the director's response?

1382
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,322
Let us find out.

1383
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:02,124
(Curious)

1384
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:06,828
What was the director's response?

1385
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:08,012
Let us find out.

1386
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,421
(Curious)

1387
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:14,098
(What was the secret...)

1388
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:15,439
(behind the scene...)

1389
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,939
(where she bit off the apple?)

1390
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,807
That part was already in the script.

1391
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:24,348
Many people shared their thoughts on it...

1392
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:26,249
and even mentioned the fruit of knowledge.

1393
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,703
First, I put that scene in to show that only the true daughter...

1394
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:30,289
would be able to leisurely eat an apple...

1395
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:33,118
and roam around the house as if it was her own.

1396
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,859
It started out that way,

1397
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,283
but I began to find other meanings as I was filming.

1398
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:40,928
(What is the truth behind the dragonfly?)

1399
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:42,669
That was strictly a coincidence.

1400
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,269
We do prepare thoroughly for our scenes,

1401
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,638
but depending on the nature of the set,

1402
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:49,992
we may not be able to do exactly as we've planned.

1403
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:52,269
She was next to the window during the rehearsal,

1404
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,663
and we spotted the dead dragonfly.

1405
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:59,867
I knew beforehand that Hye Na was going to die,

1406
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:02,918
so it gave me an odd feeling and decided to film it.

1407
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:05,548
I didn't plan it out to have a significant meaning,

1408
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:08,145
but our audience came up with various interpretations.

1409
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,589
That's when I realized that the owner of this drama...

1410
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,407
was not us, but the viewers.

1411
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,315
It wasn't intentional either.

1412
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:17,529
(Were there anything that was intentional?)

1413
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,468
Ready. Action.

1414
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:21,994
- Action. - Action.

1415
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,109
(Sky Castle was made with the best team of staffs.)

1416
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,867
(Now, they will reveal the hidden intentions.)

1417
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,548
For every single scene I watched,

1418
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:34,782
I could feel that our synergy was powerful.

1419
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,660
I wondered when I'd be able to work on another project where all...

1420
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:41,972
the staff and actors would have great chemistry.

1421
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:44,289
Try to talk more smoothly.

1422
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:45,643
Every time I start a new drama,

1423
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,455
I devote myself completely to it.

1424
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:50,698
(The secrets will be revealed.)

1425
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:52,528
- Ready. - Ready.

1426
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:53,711
Cut. Good.

1427
00:55:53,739 --> 00:56:01,539
(The Secret of the Castle)

1428
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,801
(First secret: the set's design)

1429
00:56:03,949 --> 00:56:06,519
(The characters lived in flashy houses.)

1430
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,319
(The luxurious props grabbed the viewers' attention.)

1431
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,956
(What is the secret behind the interior designs?)

1432
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,028
There are five different characters,

1433
00:56:17,029 --> 00:56:19,352
and I wanted to portray each of their desires.

1434
00:56:19,429 --> 00:56:21,298
(A grandeur that attempts to veil one's past weakness)

1435
00:56:21,299 --> 00:56:23,269
(The color black which reflects Min Hyuk's authority)

1436
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:24,999
(An interior design which goes against the previous authority)

1437
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,192
(Freewheeling and flashy)

1438
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:30,944
(Second secret: the soundtrack)

1439
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,209
(The song, "We All Lie", always made the viewers anxious.)

1440
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,908
(It was considered to be the best ending song.)

1441
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:42,319
(What is the secret behind the soundtrack?)

1442
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,448
I really enjoyed seeing that every character was two-faced...

1443
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:48,894
and pretended to be good people.

1444
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,523
I thought about the keyword for this drama,

1445
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,363
and it was "lies".

1446
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,873
While composing the song, I had that keyword...

1447
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,159
in my mind and made such a song.

1448
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:07,339
(Schubert's "Erlkonig" was Joo Young's theme song.)

1449
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,008
(Is there a secret behind this?)

1450
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:13,348
Before I received the script for episode 13,

1451
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:15,137
I had already chosen this song as her theme song.

1452
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,749
And then, I read the script...

1453
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,888
and found out that the writer wrote,

1454
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:22,959
"Kim Joo Young is listening to "Erlkonig".

1455
00:57:23,259 --> 00:57:26,959
The fact that we both thought of the same song...

1456
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,647
is quite fascinating.

1457
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,136
(Third secret: mise en scene)

1458
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:37,439
(Through various camerawork and artistic scenes,)

1459
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,610
(the drama grabbed the viewers' attention.)

1460
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,292
Overall, we filmed a lot while circling the actors.

1461
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:49,178
The camera moved in accordance with the characters' emotions.

1462
00:57:49,179 --> 00:57:51,689
We did that so that the viewers could...

1463
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:55,094
empathize and assimilate with the characters.

1464
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,682
I want to kill Kim Hye Na.

1465
00:57:59,029 --> 00:58:02,459
We used mirrors and other reflective devices...

1466
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,550
to portray the characters' other sides.

1467
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,468
Sometimes, we even used 3 to 4 reflections...

1468
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:11,868
to depict the characters' true feelings, inner feelings,

1469
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:13,395
and even those inner feelings' innermost feelings.

1470
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:15,457
Every time they had to decide on something,

1471
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,176
we used such reflections.

1472
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:20,391
Ready.

1473
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:21,578
- Action! - Action!

1474
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:22,802
(Fourth secret: directing)

1475
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,448
We'll start off far away...

1476
00:58:24,449 --> 00:58:26,819
and then dolly in until we zoom into your face.

1477
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,089
(A high-quality drama was made.)

1478
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:32,625
(What is the secret behind their filming directions?)

1479
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:35,528
There is a message in this drama that's aimed at...

1480
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:40,286
all the parents who are raising and educating their kids.

1481
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,781
I wished that they would watch this drama of all people.

1482
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:47,778
We tried not to seem like we were teaching them,

1483
00:58:47,779 --> 00:58:49,948
so we put in some humor.

1484
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:53,283
In order to prevent this drama from being easy to predict,

1485
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:56,784
we really gave it our all and focused on the details.

1486
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,840
- You should use your body too. - Okay.

1487
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,459
I thought he'd be perfect,

1488
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,509
(He's acting with her.)

1489
00:59:04,259 --> 00:59:06,828
Suh Joon, you need to show that you're not enjoying your meal.

1490
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:09,468
Count how many grains of rice there are with your chopsticks.

1491
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:10,984
- Okay. - Count your rice.

1492
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:16,215
Try to pick out one grain out of all the grains.

1493
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,339
I'm going to do a close-up later.

1494
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,738
- So make sure it doesn't show. - Okay.

1495
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:21,379
You were being emotional earlier.

1496
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,419
Okay.

1497
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,503
(This is how the close-up scene was made.)

1498
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:27,164
Go ahead and kill me.

1499
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:29,548
They try to hide...

1500
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:31,003
their enormous greed as they talk.

1501
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,589
And in order to portray that,

1502
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:35,711
I decided to focus on their facial expressions.

1503
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,528
And as we reached the middle part of the drama,

1504
00:59:37,529 --> 00:59:40,156
we decided to switch from facial expressions to hand movements.

1505
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,269
People can't lie with their hands.

1506
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:46,539
And the actors and actresses understood that very quickly.

1507
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,914
So they did a very good job.

1508
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:52,709
(Director Jo Hyun Tak leads the drama shoot...)

1509
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,678
(with this meticulous directing skills and laughter.)

1510
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:56,568
- "By the way." - "By the way."

1511
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:58,720
"By the way."

1512
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:02,283
(What's the most memorable scene as the director?)

1513
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,388
The main character of this drama is Han Suh Jin.

1514
01:00:06,389 --> 01:00:09,388
And Yum Jung Ah portrayed the delicate emotions...

1515
01:00:09,389 --> 01:00:12,359
of how determined Suh Jin was to send her daughter...

1516
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,499
to SNU's Med School even if that meant she needed...

1517
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,903
to overcome her conscience or any other obstacle that got in her way.

1518
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:22,598
I still can't stop thinking about that even after the shoot.

1519
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,757
It's still deep in my heart.

1520
01:00:27,179 --> 01:00:28,321
Please save...

1521
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,765
Yeh Suh, Coach Kim.

1522
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,516
I feel like I'll sometimes think about those scenes...

1523
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,185
when I'm alone even after the shoot is over.

1524
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:48,740
(What would you like to say to the viewers of Sky Castle?)

1525
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,143
Thank you so much.

1526
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,999
Every single viewer is very precious to me.

1527
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,363
What's the ultimate goal of life?

1528
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,733
Is it being successful? The answer is no.

1529
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:00,627
It's the happiness you feel as a family,

1530
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,709
and the happiness you feel with the people around you.

1531
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:05,178
I hope this gives you an opportunity to think about stuff like that.

1532
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:06,734
(Think about the happiness that comes from the people around you.)

1533
01:01:07,449 --> 01:01:11,762
First of all, I'd like to thank the viewers.

1534
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,059
Your love...

1535
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,689
enabled us to passionately shoot the drama until the end.

1536
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,446
I was able to realize...

1537
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,528
that I was being loved...

1538
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:23,186
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

1539
01:01:23,469 --> 01:01:26,798
I was able to realize how much I was loved and how precious I am...

1540
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,638
by watching the results on TV.

1541
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:32,569
And I feel like we received so much love thanks to that.

1542
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,939
I'd like to sincerely thank you for that.

1543
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,142
I received a lot more love than I deserved thanks to this drama.

1544
01:01:39,009 --> 01:01:41,548
I was so happy and grateful.

1545
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:44,488
I'd like to thank Na Ra for putting up...

1546
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:46,888
with my giddiness and immature behavior until the end.

1547
01:01:46,889 --> 01:01:47,888
Thank you.

1548
01:01:47,889 --> 01:01:49,218
(Touching and warm)

1549
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:51,859
I'd like to say something.

1550
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:55,028
As a viewer of the drama, I'd like to thank the four of you.

1551
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:59,169
You made me look forward to every Fridays and Saturdays.

1552
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,399
And I'm very grateful to all of you for giving me so much joy.

1553
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,299
I'm sure the other viewers feel the same way.

1554
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,649
(And the last story...)

1555
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,979
Thanks to your love and attention,

1556
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,618
we were able to cheer up until the end and finish the shoot.

1557
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:17,089
I wish you all a happy New Year.

1558
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,726
And thank you very much for loving our drama, Sky Castle.

1559
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,589
This won't be the end. We'll surely meet again.

1560
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:26,994
And I'd like to thank the staff for everything they've done.

1561
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,598
I'd also like to thank the viewers...

1562
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:34,275
for allowing Sky Castle to have a rating over 20 percent.

1563
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:35,539
Thank you.

1564
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,868
I hope the three of us will get to meet you again...

1565
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:40,609
- through a lot of other works. - Good luck.

1566
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:41,791
Thank you.

1567
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:43,709
Thank you so much for watching...

1568
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:45,278
And supporting our drama...

1569
01:02:45,279 --> 01:02:47,169
Until the very end.

1570
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:48,835
- Bye. - Bye.

1571
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:52,848
I'd like to thank all the viewers...

1572
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:55,658
who watched Sky Castle. Thank you!

1573
01:02:55,659 --> 01:02:57,459
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1574
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,843
Thank you so much.

1575
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,518
We're done now.

1576
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:08,339
- It's all over now. - Great job.

1577
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,360
- You did so great. - My goodness.

1578
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,309
It's so pretty. Thank you.

1579
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,157
- Great. - Professor Cha.

1580
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,709
Thank you.

1581
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,003
- Great job. - It's so pretty.

1582
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:22,078
- Professor Woo. - Goodness.

1583
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,289
