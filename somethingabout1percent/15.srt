6
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not drunk.</font>

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,400
<font color="yellow">I'd like to be drunk, though.</font>

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,700

about everything, with time.</font>

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,700
<font color="yellow">About what you just said...</font>

13
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,799
<font color="yellow">don't believe that drivel.</font>

14
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,700
<font color="yellow">It's a lie.</font>

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,700
<font color="yellow">I don't believe that.</font>

16
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,400
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,800
<font color="yellow">Um, what brings you here?</font>

18
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,500
<font color="yellow"><i>You said that you weren't interested
in my Grandpa's fortune, at all!</i></font>

19
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,599
<font color="yellow">I don't have any interest in
that husband clause, yes.</font>

20
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,699
<font color="yellow">But still, a deal must
be fair to both parties.</font>

21
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:24,599
<font color="yellow">But you know, both parties need to keep
a promise for it to have any meaning.</font>

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
<font color="yellow"><i>How about we save sleeping
with each other for later?</i></font>

23
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,800
<font color="yellow">You must be out of your mind!</font>

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,099
<font color="yellow">Who said that I wanted
to sleep with you?</font>

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,199
<font color="yellow">- What's with you?
- Ow!</font>

26
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,699
<font color="yellow">Ow.</font>

27
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,300
<font color="yellow"><i>Happy birthday to you!</i></font>

28
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:33,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Congratulations on your birthday!</i></font>

29
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Come on, smile! These will
all be treasured memories.</i></font>

30
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,500
<font color="yellow">I think that I might
like you, Mr. Jae In.</font>

31
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
<font color="yellow">I like kissing you, too.</font>

32
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,699
<font color="yellow">Nobody can make me forget her.</font>

33
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,300
<font color="yellow">- Back off.
- Hey!</font>

34
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,000
<font color="yellow">Wow, he's gotten a lot more handsome.</font>

35
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,000
<font color="yellow">Big Brother!</font>

36
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're here?</font>

37
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's Ji-sus!</font>

38
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,399
<font color="yellow">No, I have to resist today.
Let's go, Big Brother.</font>

39
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
<font color="yellow">Do you really need to be
holding onto me?</font>

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,399
<font color="yellow">- You're not letting go?
- No!</font>

41
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,800
<font color="yellow">How does this look, Big Brother?</font>

42
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,699
<font color="yellow">Oh... yeah.
It looks fine.</font>

43
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,199
<font color="yellow">Big Brother!</font>

44
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,399
<font color="yellow">It looks nice on you.
Buy that.</font>

45
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,000
<font color="yellow">You're really not going to go home?</font>

46
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,399
<font color="yellow">I told you, I have an audition tomorrow!</font>

47
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,699
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but it isn't an audition
for potential fashion models!</font>

48
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,000
<font color="yellow">You better go back to Canada
if you fail this audition!</font>

49
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,199
<font color="yellow">Canada, Canada!
You're really being too much.</font>

50
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,300
<font color="yellow">I'm trying so hard like this on my own
without relying on your money, though!</font>

51
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,500
<font color="yellow">The least you could be doing is praising
me, and yet you're saying this?</font>

52
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, fine.
Good job.</font>

53
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,000
<font color="yellow">You really did a good job.</font>

54
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,300
<font color="yellow">But still, you're going back to
Canada if you fail this audition.</font>

55
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:21,199
<font color="yellow">DaDa. Ji Su has really
become a lot more skilled!</font>

56
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,500
<font color="yellow">Should I go and get some
autographs from him?</font>

57
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,100
<font color="yellow">What are you staring at?</font>

58
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,500
<font color="yellow">Why that...
those little... ugh!</font>

59
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,300
<font color="yellow">That rotten bastard!</font>

60
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,800
<font color="yellow">DaDa. Want me to go down there
and kick him hard for you?</font>

61
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,300
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Let's go.
I'm hungry.</font>

62
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,000
<font color="yellow">This is why I'm saying that you
need to see someone, too!</font>

63
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,100
<font color="yellow">Go on some arranged dates, or something!</font>

64
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,800
<font color="yellow">I'll have tons of great rich guys
lined up, just waiting!</font>

65
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I'm not even
completely over all this yet.</font>

66
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,300
<font color="yellow">So it'd be unfair to the other person.</font>

67
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,600
<font color="yellow">Unfair, my ass!</font>

68
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,399
<font color="yellow">You can only win against
a man with another man!</font>

69
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

70
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,699
<font color="yellow"><i>You're not going to give me a
"good job" stamp this time?</i></font>

71
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,000
<font color="yellow">Good... job.</font>

72
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,299
<font color="yellow">There's nothing here.</font>

73
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,399
<font color="yellow">It's not like I did anything to deserve
getting a "good job" stamp, though.</font>

74
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

75
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,600
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's nothing.</font>

76
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,399
<font color="yellow">If I had known that this
was going to happen</font>

77
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,700
<font color="yellow">I would've given it my all
when I was dating him.</font>

78
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,299
<font color="yellow">I would've done everything that
everyone else does, with him</font>

79
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,799
<font color="yellow">so that I wouldn't have any regrets.</font>

80
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,000
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

81
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:48,200
<font color="yellow">Rather, I shouldn't have made
any memories with him.</font>

82
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,899
<font color="yellow">So he really ended things with Da Hyun?</font>

83
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,100
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

84
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,500
<font color="yellow">He's really a lot scarier
than I'd thought!</font>

85
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,299
<font color="yellow">Of course he is.
He's my grandson, after all.</font>

86
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,200
<font color="yellow">One's work life and dating life
should be kept separate, after all.</font>

87
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,600
<font color="yellow">A long, long time ago, there was a salt
merchant travelling through the hills.</font>

88
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,200
<font color="yellow">And then, he ran into a scary tiger.</font>

89
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,100
<font color="yellow">The tiger rushed at the salt
merchant, and swallowed him!</font>

90
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,399
<font color="yellow">All right.
Relax, and take it easy.</font>

91
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,799
<font color="yellow">Okay, right turn.</font>

92
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,500
<font color="yellow">Wait, you have to signal!</font>

93
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,399
<font color="yellow">Um, right turn?</font>

94
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,500
<font color="yellow">Just keep going straight.</font>

95
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,399
<font color="yellow">And the salt vendor received
a huge reward in the end!</font>

96
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,000
<font color="yellow">After you finish your scheduled
activities for the morning, you...</font>

97
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,399
<font color="yellow">The chairman called and told me
to remind you, sir, that...</font>

98
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:39,600
<font color="yellow">you're having lunch with the second
daughter of the chairman of Ganghan Inc.</font>

99
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,600
<font color="yellow">Looks like our chairman
is doing just fine.</font>

100
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
<font color="yellow">Tell him that he needn't worry about it.</font>

101
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,500
<font color="yellow">Are you... really going to marry
this person right away?</font>

102
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,700
<font color="yellow">I'm the only direct descendant
of the Lee family line.</font>

103
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,899
<font color="yellow">My grandfather won't stand for it
if I don't get married.</font>

104
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,600
<font color="yellow">But if you marry the wrong person</font>

105
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
<font color="yellow">we'll potentially have a
terrible Madam to worry about!</font>

106
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,299
<font color="yellow">Please consider your options carefully.</font>

107
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:08,200
<font color="yellow">My hands are tied, though.</font>

108
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,700
<font color="yellow">We'll sign pre-nups
before getting married.</font>

109
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,200
<font color="yellow">Of course, we must sign an M&A contract
for our companies before doing that.</font>

110
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,399
<font color="yellow">Aren't you speaking
a bit too matter-of-factly?</font>

111
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,000
<font color="yellow">I don't think there is any need
for either of us to waste time.</font>

112
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,700
<font color="yellow">Aren't those the terms you agreed to
by coming out here, anyway?</font>

113
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,399
<font color="yellow">But still, I thought you'd
maintain a basic level of etiquette.</font>

114
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,500
<font color="yellow">A marriage isn't a
business venture, after all.</font>

115
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,100
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

116
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,200
<font color="yellow">28.</font>

117
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,799
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you've been to plenty of
meetings like this by now, at your age.</font>

118
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,500
<font color="yellow">And yet you still aren't
familiar of the rules of our world?</font>

119
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,600
<font color="yellow">This marriage is a deal.
It's strictly business.</font>

120
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,299
<font color="yellow">Nothing more, nothing less.</font>

121
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,299
<font color="yellow">Let's stop things here.</font>

122
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,799
<font color="yellow">I feel like neither one of us can
fulfill the other's expectations.</font>

123
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,200
<font color="yellow">Yes, Jae In is quite picky when
it comes to women. And so am I.</font>

124
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were well aware of the fact
that SH Group is a formidable force.</font>

125
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,600
<font color="yellow">Director Lee didn't go home
yesterday, either?</font>

126
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
<font color="yellow">No, ma'am.</font>

127
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,500
<font color="yellow">I'm so worried for him,
he's overworking himself so much!</font>

128
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,399
<font color="yellow">Don't worry!</font>

129
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,299
<font color="yellow">That amount of work won't kill him.</font>

130
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,899
<font color="yellow">Father-in-Law!</font>

131
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:37,500
<font color="yellow">I'll be going, then.</font>

132
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,700
<font color="yellow">Father-in-Law.</font>

133
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,899
<font color="yellow">I... did the right thing, didn't I?</font>

134
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,600
<font color="yellow">They broke up because that's all
their relationship amounted to.</font>

135
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,700
<font color="yellow">They only liked each other
that much, is all.</font>

136
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,100
<font color="yellow">So don't beat yourself up too much.</font>

137
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,500
<font color="yellow">They have nobody to blame
but themselves.</font>

138
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:14,200
<font color="yellow">Good work today everyone!
Gather around!</font>

139
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,899
<font color="yellow">Make sure you all get home safe, okay?</font>

140
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:18,899
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Teacher.
- Yes, Teacher.</font>

141
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:19,899
<font color="yellow">And watch out for cars!</font>

142
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,500
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, Teacher!
- Goodbye, Teacher!</font>

143
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,700
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

144
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, Ru Mi!
Let me straighten that up for you.</font>

145
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,799
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, Teacher.
- Bye, now!</font>

146
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,799
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

147
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,399
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I can guarantee you
this friend of mine is a good guy.</font>

148
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,700
<font color="yellow">Is he really good-looking?</font>

149
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah, totally!</font>

150
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,100
<font color="yellow">He's like Won Bin and
Jo In Sung put together!</font>

151
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,600
<font color="yellow">But the most important thing of all
is that he's an herbalist!</font>

152
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,200
<font color="yellow">You're not lying to me, are you?</font>

153
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,000
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you if he ends up being
a mommy's boy or a player!</font>

154
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,399
<font color="yellow">Hey, DaDa.</font>

155
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,500
<font color="yellow">I told you, I did an
initial scan of him already!</font>

156
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
<font color="yellow">Man, I'm full.</font>

157
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,700
<font color="yellow">Just try meeting him.</font>

158
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,600
<font color="yellow">And if it doesn't work out
even after you've dated around a bit</font>

159
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,500
<font color="yellow">I'll take responsibility for you,
so don't worry.</font>

160
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,600
<font color="yellow">- Just leave it to me.
- Geez.</font>

161
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
<font color="yellow">I told you, no players!
So stop it with that, already!</font>

162
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,500
<font color="yellow">Hey. It's because of you
that I can't get married!</font>

163
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,200
<font color="yellow">You should eat more.</font>

164
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,500
<font color="yellow">Give me an employee discount, okay?</font>

165
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,000
<font color="yellow">It's on me.</font>

166
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,899
<font color="yellow">It's a gift from me to commemorate
you overcoming your heartbreak.</font>

167
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,799
<font color="yellow">Wow! Wait, since you're
buying me things already...</font>

168
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,000
<font color="yellow">Um... oh!</font>

169
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
<font color="yellow">Buy me this, too!</font>

170
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,000
<font color="yellow">Geez!
Don't make me yell at you!</font>

171
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,899
<font color="yellow">I broke up with a guy, and
I was in tons of pain, you know!</font>

172
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,000
<font color="yellow">Wow, you were never this sly before!</font>

173
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,400
<font color="yellow">So you're not going to buy this for me?</font>

174
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,900
<font color="yellow">Fine, fine!</font>

175
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,400
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? She eats well now
and even smiles nowadays.</font>

176
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
<font color="yellow">Da Hyun doesn't like cream spaghetti.</font>

177
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,799
<font color="yellow">She usually can't even finish
an entire plate of it.</font>

178
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,000
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

179
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
<font color="yellow">Just ask me to buy you all
the clothes here, why don't you!</font>

180
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,000
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

181
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,000
<font color="yellow"><i>[Lee Jae]</i></font>

182
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,000
<font color="yellow"><i>[Lee Jae In]</i></font>

183
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:40,500
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Mom?</font>

184
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,599
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's Dad's acquaintance?</font>

185
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,599
<font color="yellow">Then sure, I'll meet with him.</font>

186
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,000
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll do well.</font>

187
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

188
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:04,299
<font color="yellow">Oh... it's raining.</font>

189
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:51,400
<font color="yellow"><i>I think...</i></font>

190
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,099
<font color="yellow">that I might like you, Mr. Jae In.</font>

191
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,099
<font color="yellow">Are you really thinking of finding
a school to work at in Jinju, too?</font>

192
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,700
<font color="yellow">Ms. Da Hyun.</font>

193
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

194
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,700
<font color="yellow">Ms. Da Hyun.</font>

195
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,299
<font color="yellow">I'll drive you home.
It's raining, after all.</font>

196
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,700
<font color="yellow">No, I can just catch
a cab right outside.</font>

197
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,299
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

198
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:50,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about today.
I haven't fully recovered yet.</font>

199
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,700
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

200
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,799
<font color="yellow">Thanks for bringing me to your hotel.</font>

201
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,105
<font color="yellow">I'd heard that she was sick.</font>

202
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,200
<font color="yellow">Did she lose weight?</font>

203
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,700
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

204
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,500
<font color="yellow">My name is Jung Hyun Jin.</font>

205
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,200
<font color="yellow">I'm your cousin's
ex-girlfriend's best friend.</font>

206
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,000
<font color="yellow">So, um, Kim Da Hyun is my friend.</font>

207
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,200
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

208
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,000
<font color="yellow">You should be showing
interest in this issue, you know!</font>

209
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,200
<font color="yellow">You kidnapped my Da Hyun, after all.</font>

210
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:35,700
<font color="yellow">I'm not the one who kidnapped her.</font>

211
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,200
<font color="yellow">I saved her!</font>

212
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,000
<font color="yellow">Let's be real, though. You didn't save
her because you wanted to.</font>

213
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,599
<font color="yellow">You only did it because of that
high-and-mighty cousin of yours.</font>

214
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,099
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want to say?</font>

215
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,099
<font color="yellow">You know that Mr. Lee Jae In
and my friend broke up, right?</font>

216
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:51,700
<font color="yellow">Well, I think I did hear
something about that, yes.</font>

217
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,900
<font color="yellow">Those two were really good together.</font>

218
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,599
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

219
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,400
<font color="yellow">How about we do
a good deed for those two?</font>

220
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not that good of a person
to be interested in such things.</font>

221
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,700
<font color="yellow">Also, I have no interest in
others' love lives.</font>

222
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,700
<font color="yellow">Wow, what an asshole!</font>

223
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,299
<font color="yellow">Fine. I guess Da Hyun can see other
men without any worries now.</font>

224
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,099
<font color="yellow">It's not like Lee Jae In is the
only man on this planet!</font>

225
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,299
<font color="yellow">- You have such a young-looking face.
- Oh, thank you.</font>

226
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,799
<font color="yellow">Well, I like to read.</font>

227
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,200
<font color="yellow">What do you enjoy doing?</font>

228
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,500
<font color="yellow">Well, I like exercising and watching
movies. And watching movies alone.</font>

229
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,599
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

230
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,299
<font color="yellow">Shall we go somewhere else?</font>

231
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,000
<font color="yellow">That'd be for the best, right?</font>

232
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,299
<font color="yellow">If we stay, it'll just be
uncomfortable for both of us.</font>

233
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

234
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,099
<font color="yellow">- You know, Cousin...
- I told you to call me Big Bro.</font>

235
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,200
<font color="yellow">You're only seven months
older than me, though.</font>

236
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,200
<font color="yellow">Well, anyway.
Big Bro.</font>

237
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,400
<font color="yellow">It's the first time I've seen you
be considerate of someone.</font>

238
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,299
<font color="yellow">I have a debt to repay to that woman.</font>

239
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,099
<font color="yellow">I've done all that I could.</font>

240
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,500
<font color="yellow">Man, that stubborn ass.</font>

241
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, I don't mean you.
I'm talking about your cousin.</font>

242
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,700
<font color="yellow">Man, really.</font>

243
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,299
<font color="yellow">I guess that's why he makes
so much money, huh?</font>

244
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:16,400
<font color="yellow">Because he's so stupidly stubborn!</font>

245
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,799
<font color="yellow">But still, my Big Bro -- no, I mean, my
cousin -- held himself back a lot.</font>

246
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,900
<font color="yellow">Does he really not have any
feelings left for her, then?</font>

247
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,700
<font color="yellow">Thank you for today.</font>

248
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,299
<font color="yellow">I guess he didn't love Da Hyun
as much as I thought he did.</font>

249
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,700
<font color="yellow">I guess I misunderstood.</font>

250
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,500
<font color="yellow">Wait, no, that works out
for the best, then.</font>

251
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,299
<font color="yellow">Since she can meet someone better
with no regrets.</font>

252
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,400
<font color="yellow">At any rate, I've done all that I could.</font>

253
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,299
<font color="yellow">So if I hear anything about contracts
or a kidnapping through the media</font>

254
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,200
<font color="yellow">you'll have to take responsibility
for all that, Ms. Jung Hyun Jin.</font>

255
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,599
<font color="yellow">My cousin is quite a
scary fellow, you see.</font>

256
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:55,200
<font color="yellow">Sure, sure.
I know.</font>

257
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
<font color="yellow">Also, I also know that it won't
benefit Da Hyun in any way</font>

258
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,500
<font color="yellow">for rumors like that
to get around, either.</font>

259
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,599
<font color="yellow">So I had no intention of posting
an exposé about this online.</font>

260
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:08,000
<font color="yellow">At any rate, thank you.
Goodbye, now.</font>

261
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,099
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

262
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,299
<font color="yellow">Wait, so are you saying
that you deceived me?</font>

263
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,200
<font color="yellow">It was bad enough that
you threatened me!</font>

264
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, what do you mean, threaten?</font>

265
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,500
<font color="yellow">I was just a bit desperate, is all.</font>

266
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
<font color="yellow"><i>[Will you delete this photo?]</i>
<i>[No]</i></font>

267
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,099
<font color="yellow">The meeting is starting, Director.</font>

268
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,299
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

269
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,299
<font color="yellow">I've prepared a simulation
of what it'd be like for us</font>

270
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:25,200
<font color="yellow">to achieve 80 percent
of our marketing goals.</font>

271
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,299
<font color="yellow">First, we'll establish an infrastructure
geared towards Canadian tourists.</font>

272
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,799
<font color="yellow">And we'll prepare something
that most Canadians like...</font>

273
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,400
<font color="yellow">Director!</font>

274
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,799
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

275
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:45,400
<font color="yellow">Let's end the meeting for today. Can
you take care of the rest, Chief Park?</font>

276
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

277
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,700
<font color="yellow">Is it okay for me to contact you again?</font>

278
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:13,400
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

279
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,400
<font color="yellow">Do you like that man?</font>

280
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,599
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me
something like that?</font>

281
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
<font color="yellow">Is that why you told him that it's
okay for him to contact you again?</font>

282
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,799
<font color="yellow">He's a good person.</font>

283
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,099
<font color="yellow">It's about time for me to see
other people now, too.</font>

284
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,299
<font color="yellow">That way, I'll be able
to get married, and--</font>

285
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:58,200
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about other men.</font>

286
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,299
<font color="yellow">This is none of your
business, Mr. Jae In!</font>

287
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,799
<font color="yellow">What are you...</font>

288
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:15,200
<font color="yellow">If just you can bear it, DaDa,
then so can I.</font>

289
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,299
<font color="yellow">You'll have to quit
your job at the school.</font>

290
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:24,599
<font color="yellow">There will always be security
guards around you</font>

291
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,000
<font color="yellow">and there will be tons of reporters
bothering you all the time.</font>

292
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,900
<font color="yellow">And I can't be with you every day,
like other men can.</font>

293
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,400
<font color="yellow">My mother will be on my side,
but she might be mean to you.</font>

294
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,000
<font color="yellow">But you can just ignore what
everyone else thinks, though.</font>

295
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,700
<font color="yellow">You might not be able
to do anything for me.</font>

296
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
<font color="yellow">Are you okay with that?</font>

297
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,900
<font color="yellow">How... could I possibly
be okay with that?</font>

298
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,099
<font color="yellow">But still, try and bear it.</font>

299
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
<font color="yellow">Just do this for me, just this once.</font>

300
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,299
<font color="yellow">I'll be good to you later,
when we're old.</font>

301
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:10,700
<font color="yellow">There's...</font>

302
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,099
<font color="yellow">nothing that has changed
about the two of us.</font>

303
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:21,299
<font color="yellow">So... will we be able to start over?</font>

304
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,700
<font color="yellow">You're positive that
nothing has changed?</font>

305
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,400
<font color="yellow">That's a relief, then.</font>

306
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,500
<font color="yellow">I want to marry you.</font>

307
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,700
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jae In.</font>

308
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,900
<font color="yellow">I... I don't have the
confidence to say yes.</font>

309
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
<font color="yellow">What a terrible guy.</font>

310
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,000
<font color="yellow">I'd almost forgotten all about him, too.</font>

311
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,900
<font color="yellow">I've been trying to forget about him,
so why is he here now?</font>

312
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,299
<font color="yellow">What does he want me to do?</font>

313
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,500
<font color="yellow">What are you so surprised about?
You're making me feel bad.</font>

314
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,900
<font color="yellow">I didn't know
that I'd run into you here.</font>

315
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,799
<font color="yellow">Well, what else was I supposed to move?</font>

316
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,599
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't budge,
so I had to come to you.</font>

317
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,000
<font color="yellow">Come on, just come with me.</font>

318
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,799
<font color="yellow">I really don't have the luxury to be
considerate of your circumstances.</font>

319
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,000
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

320
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,000
<font color="yellow">Do I have to drag you?</font>

321
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,299
<font color="yellow">Are you seeing anyone?</font>

322
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:48,599
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

323
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,200
<font color="yellow">Good. I'm not dating anyone either.</font>

324
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,299
<font color="yellow">You really aren't?
I don't think that's quite true.</font>

325
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:58,799
<font color="yellow">I told you, I'm not seeing anyone.</font>

326
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,200
<font color="yellow">Unlike someone, who has someone
who drops her off at home and such.</font>

327
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,400
<font color="yellow">I really didn't do that.</font>

328
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,799
<font color="yellow">Well, I, at the very least, didn't go
shopping with someone all giddily!</font>

329
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,300
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
What did you even see?</font>

330
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,099
<font color="yellow">When did I ever go shopping?</font>

331
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,099
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

332
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:16,300
<font color="yellow">"Oh?"</font>

333
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,400
<font color="yellow">What, you saw that but you didn't see us
going into the same hotel room?</font>

334
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:22,599
<font color="yellow">Stop the car.</font>

335
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,300
<font color="yellow">She's my younger sister!</font>

336
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,000
<font color="yellow">She's from Canada.</font>

337
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,699
<font color="yellow">You said hello back then to
my aunt's husband, right?</font>

338
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,000
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

339
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,699
<font color="yellow">So, what's your answer?</font>

340
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,199
<font color="yellow">Wait, no.
Your answer isn't that important.</font>

341
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,800
<font color="yellow">Because no matter what
anyone says, I'm marrying DaDa.</font>

342
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,800
<font color="yellow">We can't get married just because
the two of us want to.</font>

343
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,199
<font color="yellow">You don't have to tell me that.
I already know.</font>

344
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,300
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, you're such a preachy teach.</font>

345
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,199
<font color="yellow">That's "Teacher," thank you!</font>

346
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,599
<font color="yellow">I've told you that so many times,
and yet you still don't know?</font>

347
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:25,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, Teacher!</font>

348
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,500
<font color="yellow">Don't think too long and hard about it.</font>

349
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,699
<font color="yellow">This isn't exactly a simple matter,
you know.</font>

350
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:42,900
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to see me get married
to another woman and live a happy life?</font>

351
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,900
<font color="yellow">I don't want that, either.</font>

352
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,800
<font color="yellow">I don't want another man by your side,
or another woman by mine.</font>

353
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,099
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you've been,
but I wasn't okay at all.</font>

354
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,099
<font color="yellow">I wasn't okay either!</font>

355
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,400
<font color="yellow">Then just stay by my side.
Let's stay together.</font>

356
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,699
<font color="yellow">Other people break up because
they don't love each other.</font>

357
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:17,099
<font color="yellow">So I don't know why we have
to break up because we do.</font>

358
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,199
<font color="yellow">What... did you just say?</font>

359
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:27,800
<font color="yellow">I love you, Da Hyun.</font>

360
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,000
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

361
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
<font color="yellow">You're such a terrible person!</font>

362
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,599
<font color="yellow">Why are you only telling me that now?</font>

363
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,500
<font color="yellow">My job is important to me.</font>

364
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,900
<font color="yellow">And make sure you get
your family's blessing!</font>

365
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,599
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

366
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:11,599
<font color="yellow">I can deal with everything you said,
but not those two things.</font>

367
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,800
<font color="yellow">I worked hard for ten years
to become a teacher!</font>

368
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,699
<font color="yellow">So I'll think about it after I've been
a teacher for ten more years!</font>

369
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,400
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

370
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,900
<font color="yellow">It doesn't really matter to me. I'm just
worried that it might be tough on you.</font>

371
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,300
<font color="yellow">I'll let you know if it is.</font>

372
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,400
<font color="yellow">And... no matter how much
I may like you...</font>

373
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,599
<font color="yellow">I don't have the courage to be hated
by people who'll become my family!</font>

374
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,400
<font color="yellow">So you have to get
your family's blessing, okay?</font>

375
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,099
<font color="yellow">Then... you'll marry me?</font>

376
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,500
<font color="yellow">You mean that, right?</font>

377
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,900
<font color="yellow">Wait, no. You already said
you would, so no backsies.</font>

378
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,699
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

379
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,400
<font color="yellow">I love you, too.</font>

380
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
<font color="yellow">Um, aren't you leaving?</font>

381
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,500
<font color="yellow">Can't I sleep over?</font>

382
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,400
<font color="yellow">No, you can't.</font>

383
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,500
<font color="yellow">We're going to live together
when we get married, anyway.</font>

384
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:27,599
<font color="yellow">Who knows what'll happen later on?</font>

385
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,900
<font color="yellow">We'll have to actually get
married to know that for sure.</font>

386
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,500
<font color="yellow">So, are you saying that you're
not going to marry me, then?</font>

387
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,199
<font color="yellow">I told you, yes!
I will.</font>

388
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,199
<font color="yellow">But only after we get
our families' blessings.</font>

389
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,500
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of that, okay?</font>

390
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,500
<font color="yellow">I barely got a wink of sleep
this entire time.</font>

391
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:51,000
<font color="yellow">So can't you let me sleep here?</font>

392
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:57,699
<font color="yellow">That company sure is strange.
They don't even let people sleep.</font>

393
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,000
<font color="yellow">Go home and sleep.</font>

394
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,500
<font color="yellow">No, the reason why I didn't get
any sleep is because of you.</font>

395
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,900
<font color="yellow">Just stay by my side, okay?</font>

396
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,199
<font color="yellow">That's the only way I'll
be able to fall asleep.</font>

397
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,000
<font color="yellow">Um, I don't have any clothes for
you to change into at my place</font>

398
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,199
<font color="yellow">and it'll be really
inconvenient for you.</font>

399
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,000
<font color="yellow">It's not too late for you
to go home now, and...</font>

400
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:20,500
<font color="yellow">Is it mine?</font>

401
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, are you awake?</font>

402
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,900
<font color="yellow">So it is you.</font>

403
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,800
<font color="yellow">Geez, you!
What are you doing?</font>

404
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,800
<font color="yellow">I thought that it was just
a dream this time, too.</font>

405
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,000
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream.</font>

406
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,099
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

407
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,800
<font color="yellow">I don't think it is.</font>

408
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,599
<font color="yellow">What a relief.</font>

409
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,500
