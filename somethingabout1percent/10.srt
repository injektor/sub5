00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,900

23

<font color="yellow">Yes. I do.</font>

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,599

26
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,199
<font color="yellow">Can you come up with me for a bit?

people will talk crap about you.</font>

<font color="yellow">I don't care, as long as they
don't say anything to my face.</font>

I don't care.</font>

34

<font color="yellow">Um, I'll keep that in mind.</font>

35
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:52,500
<font color="yellow">But still, I won't talk crap
about you, and wait for you.</font>

bid for Youker, we...</font>

45
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,000
<font color="yellow">Then, shall we attend to the
Chairman himself, and go to Shanghai?</font>

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,100
<font color="yellow">Oh, no! Um, the promotional materials...</font>

47
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,100
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best if it kills me, sir.
Yay, overtime work!</font>

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,000
<font color="yellow">Um, do you need to be somewhere?</font>

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,899
<font color="yellow">Yes. When the draft for the
presentation comes out</font>

50
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,500
<font color="yellow">get it looked over by the general
manager and proceed thusly.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm going to get something to eat.</font>

52

<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

53
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,000
<font color="yellow">See you later, sir.</font>

54
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,600

55
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,699
<font color="yellow">My father...</font>

56
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,000
<font color="yellow">I mean, Jae In's grandfather...
he introduced you two, right?</font>

57
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,000
<font color="yellow">Well, yes.</font>

00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,100
<font color="yellow">My father didn't mention Tae Ha?</font>

60
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
<font color="yellow">Tae... Ha?</font>

61
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,500
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,699
<font color="yellow">Oh, I had some business to
take care of here, so I stopped by.</font>

63
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,500
<font color="yellow">What, I can't even chat with a guest?</font>

64
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,500
<font color="yellow">Then go meet your guest,
instead of doing this.</font>

65
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,100
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

66
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,100
<font color="yellow">Let's chat again later.
I have more questions for you.</font>

67
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,500
<font color="yellow">Um, yes.
Goodbye.</font>

68
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,600
<font color="yellow">What was that? You should
be polite to your elders!</font>

She reaps what she sows.</font>

70
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,100
<font color="yellow">What was she talking to you about?</font>

71
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,699
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

72
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,699
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even greet her properly
because you butted in so rudely.</font>

73
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,300
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.
Let's go eat.</font>

74
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,100
<font color="yellow">I don't have much time.</font>

75
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,300
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

76
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,199
<font color="yellow">Wait, is this not the place?</font>

77
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, I found it!</font>

when you always get lost?</font>

80
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,800
<font color="yellow">I came here often with Hyun Jin.</font>

81
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,300
<font color="yellow">She doesn't eat at home much, either.</font>

82
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
<font color="yellow">Hurry and eat up!</font>

83
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

84
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,699
<font color="yellow">Fundamentally, people work to
afford their living expenses</font>

85
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,600
<font color="yellow">but here you are, with barely
any time to even eat.</font>

86
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,899
<font color="yellow">It's not like this every day.</font>

87
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,000
<font color="yellow">We have a VIP event
coming up all of a sudden, so...</font>

88
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
<font color="yellow">It seems like it is
like this every day, though.</font>

89
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,100
<font color="yellow">You should head back
after you're done eating.</font>

90
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,100
<font color="yellow">My father didn't mention Tae Ha?</font>

91
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,000
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah, Mr. Jae In.
Who's Tae Ha?</font>

92
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:25,200
<font color="yellow">Why?
Did my aunt say something to you?</font>

93
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,000
<font color="yellow">No, you just mentioned
him to me last time.</font>

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,399
<font color="yellow">So, who is he?</font>

95
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,600
<font color="yellow">My cousin.
He's my aunt's son.</font>

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
<font color="yellow">Listen up.</font>

97
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,200
<font color="yellow">If Tae Ha ever approaches you,
let me know right away.</font>

98
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,799
<font color="yellow">And ignore him no matter
what he says, okay?</font>

99
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,600
<font color="yellow">How could I act like I know him, when
I don't even know what he looks like?</font>

100
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,000
<font color="yellow">That's a relief, then.
At any rate, don't ever meet with him.</font>

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,100
<font color="yellow">Ignore him from the moment
you hear his name, got it?</font>

102
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,700
<font color="yellow">Sorry I can't drop you off.</font>

103
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,000
<font color="yellow">It's fine.
You're busy.</font>

104
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,799
<font color="yellow">Will you be able to get home by yourself?</font>

105
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,899
<font color="yellow">Just take a cab home.</font>

106
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,799
<font color="yellow">I was actually going to take
a cab to Hyun Jin's shop.</font>

107
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,500
<font color="yellow">I can find my way home from there.</font>

108
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,100
<font color="yellow">Good thinking.</font>

109
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,899
<font color="yellow">I don't know when I'll be done,
but I'll try to finish as soon as I can.</font>

110
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,799
<font color="yellow">And I'll take you home from
there later, if I have time.</font>

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,799
<font color="yellow">Sure, if you want to.</font>

112
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,299
<font color="yellow">What kinds of colors
do you wear most frequently?</font>

113
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:46,500
<font color="yellow">- Well, bright...
- Bright colors?</font>

114
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,299
<font color="yellow">Well, how's this, then?</font>

115
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,399
<font color="yellow">You have a cute face, so...</font>

116
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,100
<font color="yellow">- Do you have any other colors?
- Other colors? Ah.</font>

117
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,399
<font color="yellow">Here you are.
A yellow one.</font>

118
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,700
<font color="yellow">So we meet again.</font>

119
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,000
<font color="yellow">Yes... Ms. Han Joo Hui.</font>

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,500
<font color="yellow">It seems that you're
still seeing Jae In.</font>

121
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,200
<font color="yellow">Looks like you've lasted a
bit longer than his other flings.</font>

122
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,799
<font color="yellow">Jae In has dated tons of women before.</font>

123
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,500
<font color="yellow">And none of them
have lasted too long.</font>

124
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,799
<font color="yellow">The shortest he's seen
someone is a month</font>

125
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,100
<font color="yellow">but he hasn't seen anyone
longer than six months.</font>

126
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,200
<font color="yellow">He goes out with people, but
they break up sooner or later.</font>

127
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,700
<font color="yellow">Because the person he's going to marry
has already been predetermined.</font>

128
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,500
<font color="yellow">Really, now?</font>

129
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,100
<font color="yellow">Isn't that obvious?</font>

130
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,399
<font color="yellow">Wait, you weren't thinking that
you'd possibly marry him, were you?</font>

131
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,399
<font color="yellow">I'm warning you now,
for your own sake.</font>

132
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,799
<font color="yellow">Don't fall too hard for Jae In.</font>

133
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,200
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't know.</font>

134
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,500
<font color="yellow">Who can predict what'll happen
to two people who are dating?</font>

135
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,899
<font color="yellow">I have a guess as to why you're going
out of your way to say all this, but...</font>

136
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,700
<font color="yellow">we'll take care of our own
relationship, thanks.</font>

137
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,799
<font color="yellow">- Can I try these on?
- Yes, of course.</font>

138
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,200
<font color="yellow">I'll help you.</font>

139
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,799
<font color="yellow">Hmm, these are a bit uncomfortable.</font>

140
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,399
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that Jae In is just like
a shoe that doesn't fit right, to you.</font>

141
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,000
<font color="yellow">No, Mr. Jae In is a lot more
comfortable to be with than you'd think.</font>

142
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,500
<font color="yellow">Not that you'd know
anything about that.</font>

143
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,000
<font color="yellow">These are nice.</font>

144
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,799
<font color="yellow">You never know with shoes
until you try them on, after all.</font>

145
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,299
<font color="yellow">Ugh, should I kill that guy,
or spare him?</font>

146
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:10,299

he go around doing, anyway?</font>

148
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,000
<font color="yellow">Sir, we have the first draft
of the promo video</font>

149
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
<font color="yellow">ready for viewing, in
the conference room.</font>

150
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
<font color="yellow">All right.
I'm coming.</font>

151
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,200
<font color="yellow">So you're saying that there was
a woman who kept saying, "my Jae In?"</font>

152
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,100
<font color="yellow">Yeah. And her body language
wasn't too subtle, either.</font>

153
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
<font color="yellow">Who could she be?</font>

154
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,100
<font color="yellow">I know all the regulars at my shop.</font>

155
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,799
<font color="yellow"><i>[Mr. Lee Jae In]</i></font>

156
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,200
<font color="yellow">Hmph!
I'll never pick up.</font>

157
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,899
<font color="yellow">I'd totally pick up, if I were you.</font>

158
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,100
<font color="yellow">Aren't you curious about
who that woman is?</font>

159
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,200
<font color="yellow">Of course I am!
But this guy needs to be punished today.</font>

160
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,799
<font color="yellow">That's only fair.</font>

161
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's cute.</font>

162
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,500
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah, that!
"Being fair!"</font>

163
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,600
<font color="yellow">Why weren't you picking up?</font>

164
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,100
<font color="yellow">I had a lot to think about.</font>

165
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,700
<font color="yellow">What is it now?</font>

166
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:46,000
<font color="yellow">You're not the type to be mad just
because I didn't take you home.</font>

167
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,500
<font color="yellow">No, I am mad about that!</font>

168
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,000
<font color="yellow">I never would've run into that nasty
woman, if he'd taken me home.</font>

169
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,100
<font color="yellow">Get it together, Kim Da Hyun.</font>

170
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,500
<font color="yellow">He's not a big deal.</font>

171
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:09,700
<font color="yellow">Is that why he wanted to
date for six months?</font>

172
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:13,500
<font color="yellow">Well, I guess he's dated me
longer than anyone else, then.</font>

173
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,500
<font color="yellow">It's not like I was planning to have
a long relationship with him anyway.</font>

174
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,600
<font color="yellow">But, still! Why do I have
to deal with that bitch?</font>

175
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,100
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr. Ji Su!
What's up?</font>

176
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,899
<font color="yellow"><i>You're doing well, right, Teacher?</i></font>

177
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah. You're doing well, right?</font>

178

180
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,799
<font color="yellow">She's driving me nuts.</font>

181
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,600
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry!
I hope this goes well!</font>

182
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mom.</font>

183
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,700
<font color="yellow">Um, yeah.
I'm heading to class now.</font>

184
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,600
<font color="yellow">Love you, Mom.
Talk to you later!</font>

185
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,899
<font color="yellow">Isn't our Ji-sus just so amazing?</font>

186
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,200
<font color="yellow">I know, right?
He's so cool!</font>

187
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
<font color="yellow">Yes, I made a good choice.</font>

188
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,100
<font color="yellow">My dream is in Korea!
Sorry, Mom.</font>

189
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,899
<font color="yellow">How was I today, Teacher?</font>

190
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,500
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear the applause earlier?
You were totally amazing!</font>

191
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,299
<font color="yellow">Oh, um, hello.</font>

192
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:33,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, so we meet again.</font>

193
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,200
<font color="yellow">Are you Mr. Ji Su's manager?</font>

194
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,599
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.
I'm the president of his fanclub...</font>

195
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:45,299
<font color="yellow">Well, um, you can just
think of me as his guardian.</font>

196
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,099
<font color="yellow">But, um, what brings you here?</font>

197
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:50,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm in charge of
SH Mall's PR department.</font>

198
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,500
<font color="yellow">We were the ones who planned for him
to have a concert here today.</font>

199
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you!</font>

200
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,200
<font color="yellow">He's still a trainee, so he hasn't
been able to perform much.</font>

201
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's nothing. It's not like it
was a huge concert, anyway.</font>

202
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,099
<font color="yellow">It's just a small concert.</font>

203
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:10,200
<font color="yellow">I felt that Mr. Ji Su's concept went well
with ours, so the response has been good.</font>

204
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,799
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

205
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,500
<font color="yellow">This is great!</font>

206
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,500
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

207
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,599
<font color="yellow">But, um, it seemed that you're
having an event here next week, too.</font>

208
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, we already have someone
for the main mall, but...</font>

209
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,799
<font color="yellow">our malls in Gangnam and
Busan should still be available.</font>

210
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,799
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

211
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,099
<font color="yellow">I feel like I've been seeing
Chairman Han around quite often.</font>

212
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,500
<font color="yellow">Well, that old man has tons
of greed and time, so...</font>

213
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,099
<font color="yellow">that's all there is to it.</font>

214
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,500
<font color="yellow">Get back to work.</font>

215
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:34,900
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

216
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
<font color="yellow">Ji-sus's concert.</font>

217
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,700
<font color="yellow">He's signed to an agency already!
So why are you doing this?</font>

218
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,799
<font color="yellow">Well, it's because I'm the
president of his fanclub.</font>

219
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,700
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

220
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

221
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,900
<font color="yellow">Open the door.</font>

222
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,200
<font color="yellow">Did you want to talk about something?</font>

223
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,299
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you if you open up.</font>

224
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,599
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

225
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,000

226
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,000
<font color="yellow">I won't know unless you tell me!
So tell me why, at least.</font>

227
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,799
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to solve this or give
you an explanation otherwise.</font>

228
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,799
<font color="yellow">Why are you mad?</font>

229
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,000
<font color="yellow">How many women have you dated before?</font>

230
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,200
<font color="yellow">Do you usually date
them for at least a month</font>

231
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,400
<font color="yellow">but don't date anyone for longer than
six months, or something like that?</font>

232
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,200
<font color="yellow">Are you really jealous,
or are you just testing me?</font>

233
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,700
<font color="yellow">I'm testing you!</font>

234
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,900
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare be cheating on me.</font>

235
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,500
<font color="yellow">When would I even have time to
see another woman?</font>

236
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,900
<font color="yellow">I'm busy enough as it is,
just with dating you!</font>

237
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,200
<font color="yellow">Stop spouting nonsense.</font>

238
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,500

call me first instead.</font>

<font color="yellow">How come you never call me?</font>

240
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,500
<font color="yellow">Wait, no. How come you never pick up?</font>

241
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,599

be the one to call you first?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Mr. Lee Jae In]</i></font>

289
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,099
<font color="yellow">Oh, damn it.</font>

290
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,500
<font color="yellow">- Yes, yes. No, it's not true.
- Yes, we'll be in touch.</font>

291
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
<font color="yellow">Tell them I'm not here, no matter what.</font>

292
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

293
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,299
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're reporting this to the police.</font>

294
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:55,200
<font color="yellow">This isn't true. No. We've confirmed it,
so you don't need to call us anymore.</font>

295
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,700
<font color="yellow">Teacher!</font>

296
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,099
<font color="yellow">I picked all these
pumpkins and mugwort!</font>

297
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,500
<font color="yellow">Can we eat this now?</font>

298
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,299
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we can eat this now.</font>

299
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,599
<font color="yellow">We'll cook it, and make it
into something delicious!</font>

300
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,200
<font color="yellow">But... I thought you didn't like
pumpkins, Kyung Eun.</font>

301
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
<font color="yellow">But I'm going to eat these anyway.</font>

302
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,700
<font color="yellow">Good thinking.</font>

303
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,900
<font color="yellow">Jae In.</font>

304
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,500
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be here,
when things are like this.</font>

305
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
<font color="yellow">It's not all that bad.</font>

306
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,799
<font color="yellow">You really are the
lowest of the low.</font>

307
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,599
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who saved you
from marrying me last time.</font>

308
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,700
<font color="yellow">So I think you owe me
this much, at least.</font>

309
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,900
<font color="yellow">No. I don't owe you anything!</font>

310
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,599
<font color="yellow">And you were opposed to
getting married back then, too.</font>

311
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,299
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

312
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:56,299
<font color="yellow">I don't want some weird rumors to
spread by having you hang around here.</font>

313
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:03,200
<font color="yellow">Let me make this clear to you
before I say anything else.</font>

314
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,900
<font color="yellow">I only have one reason
for seeing you right now.</font>

315
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,599
<font color="yellow">And that's to take care of this mess.</font>

316
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,000
<font color="yellow">Tell the media to release
a corrected statement.</font>

317
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,500
<font color="yellow">Are you that against this?</font>

318
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,299
<font color="yellow">What's the reason
that we can't get married?</font>

319
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:15,700
<font color="yellow">Han Joo Hui!</font>

320
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,700
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Why are you acting this way?</font>

321
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,000
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

322
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,900
<font color="yellow">think I love you.</font>

323
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,099
<font color="yellow">Would you still love me if
I weren't Lee Jae In of SH Group?</font>

324
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,700
<font color="yellow">You don't love me.
You love SH Group.</font>

325
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,299
<font color="yellow">You did three years ago,
and you still do now.</font>

326
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:37,377
<font color="yellow">Fine, I do want to become the wife
of the future chairman of SH Group.</font>

327
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:40,099
<font color="yellow">But...
I want you, too.</font>

328
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,400
<font color="yellow">Let's just leave it at that, okay?</font>

329
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not your toy.</font>

330
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,700
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare think that you can
manipulate me however you want.</font>

331
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,799
<font color="yellow">I'm really not okay with that.</font>

332
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,099
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

333
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,099
<font color="yellow">Also, don't refer to me so casually.</font>

334
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,299
<font color="yellow">Fine. Just "Jae In" is
a bit too casual.</font>

335
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,599
<font color="yellow">I'll refer to you as "Mr. Jae In"
when we're in public.</font>

336
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,200
<font color="yellow">No, that's even worse.</font>

337
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,799
<font color="yellow">There's no nickname that
you're allowed to call me by</font>

338
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,500
<font color="yellow">so just don't even refer to me at all.</font>

339
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,700
<font color="yellow">Lee Jae In.</font>

340
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,599
<font color="yellow">If you act this way,
I can become really vicious.</font>

341
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,299
<font color="yellow">As vicious as you!</font>

342
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,200
<font color="yellow">I can be ruthless too, you know.</font>

343
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,900
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

344
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,900
<font color="yellow">Issuing threats is for people who
actually have the power to back it up.</font>

345
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,500
<font color="yellow">And you have to keep an eye on
the other person while doing so.</font>

346
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,099
<font color="yellow">I'll pretend that I didn't hear
what you just said.</font>

347
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,200
<font color="yellow">You really are a skilled player,
aren't you?</font>

348
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,000
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, Teacher.
- Bye.</font>

349
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,500
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</font>

350
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,599
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

351
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,200
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

352
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,299
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

353
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:04,200
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim Da Hyun just left.</font>

354
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:06,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

355
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,700
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd lost you.
Why do you walk so fast?</font>

356
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,799
<font color="yellow">Don't go online for the time being.
And don't watch the news, either.</font>

357
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,700
<font color="yellow">Too late for that. I already went online,
and watched the news, too.</font>

358
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,799
<font color="yellow">Oh, damn it.</font>

359
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,299
<font color="yellow">You have no redeeming
qualities about you!</font>

360
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:40,700
<font color="yellow">You curse all the time, and just go off
and get engaged on your own!</font>

361
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,099
<font color="yellow">I didn't get engaged!</font>

362
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,099
<font color="yellow">Contract Article Twelve!</font>

363
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,500
<font color="yellow">"If one party starts seeing another
person, the contract is null and void!"</font>

364
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,700
<font color="yellow">Congrats on your engagement!</font>

365
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,900
<font color="yellow">I told you, I'm not engaged!</font>

366
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,099
<font color="yellow">You want to see the screenshot I took?</font>

367
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,500
<font color="yellow">Why would you take a screenshot
of something useless like that?</font>

368
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,599
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting mad at me?
You're the one in the wrong!</font>

369
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,799
<font color="yellow">Do I really seem like
that kind of person to you?</font>

370
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:07,099
<font color="yellow">You think I'm the type of guy who'd
get engaged to another woman</font>

371
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,200
<font color="yellow">even though I'm dating you?</font>

372
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:17,200
<font color="yellow">I.... I don't know.</font>

373
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,099
<font color="yellow">Don't believe anything that didn't
come out of my own mouth.</font>

374
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:40,900
<font color="yellow">Trust only me, okay?</font>

375
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,099
<font color="yellow">Well then, make me trust you!</font>

376
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,799
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into me?</font>

377
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,299
<font color="yellow">The contract period will
be over soon, anyway.</font>

378
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:59,099
<font color="yellow">Then... it won't even matter if
you're engaged to that woman.</font>

379
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,000
<font color="yellow">Hey. Don't get ahead of yourself.</font>

380
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,599
<font color="yellow">You sure have a lot of thoughts
running through your small head.</font>

381
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:19,099
<font color="yellow">Trust only me, and
think only about me.</font>

382
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,299
<font color="yellow">I won't ever hurt you until the
contract period is over, okay?</font>

383
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,099
<font color="yellow">Also, please pick up your phone.</font>

384
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,500
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

385
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,900
<font color="yellow">Go.
Hurry and go.</font>

386
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,000
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

387
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,700
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you don't need
me to come up with you?</font>

388
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,200
<font color="yellow">Get home safe.</font>

389
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,200
<font color="yellow">Did you see everything?</font>

390
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,400
<font color="yellow">Yep.</font>

391
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,000
<font color="yellow">You two might as well have
been shooting a movie!</font>

392
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,700
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous, Kim DaDa!</font>

393
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,400
<font color="yellow">Hyun Jin.</font>

394
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,500
<font color="yellow">It looks like... I've developed
a type of love-hate for him.</font>

395
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,000
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

396
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,400
<font color="yellow">What else?</font>

397
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,200
<font color="yellow">Date your heart out
during the time you have left</font>

398
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,500
<font color="yellow">so that you're not left with any regrets.</font>

399
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,599
<font color="yellow">What if I can't bear to break
up him afterward, then?</font>

400
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
<font color="yellow">What are you worried about, exactly?</font>

401
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,000
<font color="yellow">Are you worried about breaking up with
him, or not breaking up with him?</font>

402
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,099
<font color="yellow">I mean, it's not like you're
committing adultery.</font>

403
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:07,900
<font color="yellow">And it's not like you'll get
married, and then get divorced.</font>

404
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,799
<font color="yellow">Why are you worrying
about the future now?</font>

405
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you're right.</font>

406
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,900
<font color="yellow">Also, don't you worry, sweetie.</font>

407
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,400
<font color="yellow">Big Sis here knows what she's
talking about, since she has experience.</font>

408
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,799
<font color="yellow">Breaking up with someone
really isn't a big deal.</font>

409
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:31,200
<font color="yellow">Out of sight, out of mind.
Really!</font>

410
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,799
<font color="yellow">The end!</font>

411
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,400
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

412
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,500
<font color="yellow">That'd be really nice.</font>

413
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,500
<font color="yellow">Aw, innocent little sweetheart.</font>

414
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,900
<font color="yellow">Get over here.</font>

415
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:06,900
<font color="yellow">I don't know what's gotten into me.</font>

416
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,099
<font color="yellow">The contract period will
be over soon, anyway.</font>

417
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,099
<font color="yellow">The first reporter to write about this
was Kang Jin Young from the Koryo Times.</font>

418
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:40,699
<font color="yellow">But they refuse to tell me
who gave them the information.</font>

419
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,599
<font color="yellow">How much did the prices of Hanjoo
Chemical's shares rise yesterday?</font>

420
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,500
<font color="yellow">We issued a rebuttal, but it
still went up 6.28 percent.</font>

421
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,300
<font color="yellow">And is there any evidence that
Chairman Han sold any shares yesterday?</font>

422
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
<font color="yellow">I haven't received reports
about that yet.</font>

423
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,900
<font color="yellow">Watch the prices of Hanjoo Chemicals'
shares for the time being.</font>

424
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,199
<font color="yellow">And keep an eye on their
board of directors, too.</font>

425
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,199
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

426
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,500
<font color="yellow">Something is definitely off.</font>

427
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,400
<font color="yellow">I have all the pieces of the puzzle,
but they don't seem to fit. Strange.</font>

428
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,500
<font color="yellow">Wow, it must be a nuisance having
a strict schedule for dates!</font>

429
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,199
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

430
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,800
<font color="yellow">It's the weekend.
Aren't you two going on a date?</font>

431
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,199
<font color="yellow">I have to meet Ji Su.</font>

432
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,300
<font color="yellow">And apparently hotels are
busy on weekends, too.</font>

433
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,599
<font color="yellow">I bet that guy will come running
if you tell him you're seeing Ji Su</font>

434
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,599
<font color="yellow">no matter how busy he may be.</font>

435
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,800
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm not planning to tell him.</font>

436
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,500
<font color="yellow">You sly girl!</font>

437
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,900
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

438
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,800
<font color="yellow">Even Seo Jin cast me aside for Ji Su!</font>

439
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,699
<font color="yellow">Section Chief?</font>

440
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,699
<font color="yellow">Ji Su told me about it.</font>

441
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:50,199
<font color="yellow">SH Mall is doing a lot of philanthropic
work right now as well, so...</font>

442
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,800
<font color="yellow">And I figured that there would be some
synergy between this and a small concert.</font>

443
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,400
<font color="yellow">He even said that he'd be providing
us with scholarship money.</font>

444
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,599
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

445
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:03,500
<font color="yellow">Wow, you sure are doing
great things, Ji-Sus!</font>

446
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,599
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that right, Director?
- Yeah.</font>

447
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:09,300
<font color="yellow">You don't need to head back
to the company dorms today?</font>

448
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,500
<font color="yellow">I got permission from my manager.
He said I could stay overnight.</font>

449
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,000
<font color="yellow">All right, then.
Good work.</font>

450
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,800
<font color="yellow">I bet the kids will be
really excited tonight.</font>

451
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,300
<font color="yellow">I'll come back next week, Director.</font>

452
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,699
<font color="yellow">You should hurry and head back.
It'll probably be a long trip.</font>

453
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:23,300
<font color="yellow">And don't get lost either, okay?</font>

454
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,000
<font color="yellow">I'll drive you back.</font>

455
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,599
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. It won't take long
if I take the bus.</font>

456
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,199
<font color="yellow">There aren't many roads here, so I don't
think that the bus will be here soon.</font>

457
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,500
<font color="yellow">Yeah. It's late, too. Get a ride to the
train station, at the very least.</font>

458
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,599
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

459
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,000
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

460
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,000
<font color="yellow">You can just drop me off in front
of the subway station.</font>

461
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
<font color="yellow">Where do you live?
I live near Bundang.</font>

462
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, me too!</font>

463
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
<font color="yellow">I'll drop you off near Bundang, then.</font>

464
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,599
<font color="yellow"><i>Where are you?</i></font>

465
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,300
<font color="yellow">On my way home.</font>

466
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
<font color="yellow">Yeah, so, where are you, exactly?</font>

467
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,500
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way home from the orphanage.</font>

468
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,000
<font color="yellow">Oh. When are you getting back?
I'll be done with work soon.</font>

469
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,500
<font color="yellow">Should I come get you?</font>

470
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,099
<font color="yellow">No, I told you.
I'm on my way home.</font>

471
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,300
<font color="yellow">See you on the weekend.</font>

472
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:30,099
<font color="yellow">What's going on? How come she didn't
ask me to come get her, even as a joke?</font>

473
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,500
<font color="yellow">That's the boyfriend you mentioned
last time, I presume?</font>

474
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

475
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,599
<font color="yellow">Oh... yes.</font>

476
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:42,300
<font color="yellow">Are you two going to get
married, by any chance?</font>

477
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, pardon my rudeness.</font>

478
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,900
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have asked such a
personal question, but I was curious.</font>

479
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,500
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

480
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,599
<font color="yellow">We are dating,
but that's about it for now.</font>

481
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, you can just drop me off
in front of that crosswalk.</font>

482
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,199
<font color="yellow">We're already here, so I'll just
take you all the way home.</font>

483
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,099
<font color="yellow">No. I'm thankful enough
that you brought me this far.</font>

484
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:12,099
<font color="yellow">It's really okay, though.</font>

485
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:40,099
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

486
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,000
<font color="yellow">Da Hyun?</font>

487
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,300
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jae In!</font>

488
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:59,391
<font color="yellow">Subtitles by DramaFever</font>

489
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,800
<font color="yellow"><i>So ridiculous! He doesn't
even know what he did wrong!</i></font>

490
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
<font color="yellow"><i>You're even more ridiculous!</i></font>

491
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Wow, this man really won't
reflect on what he did wrong.</i></font>

492
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,000
<font color="yellow"><i>I won't just let it slide this time.</i></font>

493
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
<font color="yellow"><i>If you don't want to be fired,
you better run over here now.</i></font>

494
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,800
<font color="yellow"><i>What do I do? I think
Da Hyun is really mad.</i></font>

495
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,699
<font color="yellow"><i>Buy her some flowers or act cutesy!</i></font>

496
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:31,699
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know what he may be planning, but
he definitely won't marry that teacher.</i></font>

497
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,099
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah. I think it's about time
that you two met.</i></font>

498
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Who know what'll happen
with Da Hyun.</i></font>

499
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Well, how do you feel?</i></font>
