3
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,710
<font color="yellow">Isn't it only natural that our
relationship makes some progress</font>

4
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,120
<font color="yellow">since we're really dating?</font>

5
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,820
<font color="yellow">But, I gave it some thought,
and I did have a strict upbringing</font>

6
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,320
<font color="yellow">so I'm not okay with sleeping with you
after the first date.</font>

You...</font>

Ow!</font>

10
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,710
<font color="yellow">I... I should be saying that right now!</font>

11
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,910
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare ever bring up anything
like "making progress," or whatnot.</font>

12
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,020
<font color="yellow">You were basically asking for a beating!</font>

I don't care.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

22
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,310
<font color="yellow">You have to stop the reporters.
That's a part of the contract, after all.</font>

23
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,710
<font color="yellow">How is a lawyer like me
supposed to stop them?</font>

24
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,810
<font color="yellow">SH Group itself should
be stopping them, instead.</font>

25
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,210
<font color="yellow">Do things that way, then.</font>

has to clean up after you?</font>

28
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,920
<font color="yellow">So, why did you even...</font>

29
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,120
<font color="yellow">show up to an official event
with a woman?</font>

30
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,020
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that the reporters would
be chasing you like bloodhounds?</font>

31
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,310
<font color="yellow">I wasn't completely unaware of the fact.</font>

32
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,120
<font color="yellow">Also, I did it because I knew that
you'd be able to stop the reporters.</font>

33
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,810
<font color="yellow">So take responsibility, and make sure
they don't publish anything about us.</font>

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,120
<font color="yellow">toward an MOU to purchase
the land for the new facility.</font>

148
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,720
<font color="yellow">All right, then. Let's end our
meeting here, for today.</font>

149
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,120
<font color="yellow">As for the land for the new hotel</font>

150
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
<font color="yellow">let's get a contract signed by
the end of next month.</font>

151
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,410
<font color="yellow">We'll fine-tune the details
and review this again later.</font>

152
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,250
<font color="yellow">That'll be all for today's meeting.</font>

153
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,320
<font color="yellow">Oh, General Manager.</font>

154
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir?</font>

155
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,120
<font color="yellow">Does our hotel's Japanese restaurant
not offer any simple a la carte dishes?</font>

156
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,820
<font color="yellow">Do they only offer prix fixe options?</font>

157
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,510
<font color="yellow">Well, that is...</font>

158
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

159
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,820
<font color="yellow"><i>[DADA]</i></font>

160
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,910
<font color="yellow">Oh, now he's not even
picking up my calls?</font>

161
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,910
<font color="yellow">Figures. If he had a shred of
morality in him, he couldn't pick up.</font>

162
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,910
<font color="yellow">Wait. He seems like the type
who has no morals, though.</font>

163
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,510
<font color="yellow">Teacher!</font>

164
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,120
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat something delicious.</font>

165
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,010
<font color="yellow">You don't have any other plans, right?</font>

166
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,510
<font color="yellow">Oh, I do have to see
someone today, actually.</font>

167
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,320
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

168
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
<font color="yellow">Just someone.</font>

169
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,120
<font color="yellow">He's so annoying. He never
listens to what I tell him to do</font>

170
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,010
<font color="yellow">and I'll have to work really hard to
shape him into a decent human being.</font>

171
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,820
<font color="yellow">Maybe I don't really need to see him.</font>

172
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,220
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

173
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,320
<font color="yellow">This teacher... No, the
president of your fan club</font>

174
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,410
<font color="yellow">will buy you something
super delicious.</font>

175
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,510
<font color="yellow">Let's move out!</font>

176
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,320
<font color="yellow">- Make sure you have everything.
- Yes, ma'am!</font>

177
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,410
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

178
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
<font color="yellow"><i>[FROM DADA]</i></font>

179
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,010
<font color="yellow">CEO Lee?
About lunch...</font>

180
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,410
<font color="yellow">About... lunch...</font>

181
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,720
<font color="yellow"><i>[DADA]</i></font>

182
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,120
<font color="yellow">What's going on?
It hasn't been a week yet.</font>

183
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,410
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.
You better not stomp on me again.</font>

184
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,010
<font color="yellow">I won't stand for it if you do!</font>

185
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,620
<font color="yellow">Hello, there.
It's quite hot today, isn't it?</font>

186
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,820
<font color="yellow">You got home safely that night, right?</font>

187
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,410
<font color="yellow">It's proper manners to start off
with pleasantries like these.</font>

188
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,120
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that?</font>

189
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,120
<font color="yellow">Didn't they teach you that
in elementary school?</font>

190
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,510
<font color="yellow">Also, you're not in the position to be
yelling at me like this right now.</font>

191
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,510
<font color="yellow"><i>[CHAIRMAN KANG]</i></font>

192
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,620
<font color="yellow">You knew that there were
reporters there, didn't you?</font>

193
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,910
<font color="yellow">And that they'd write articles about me.</font>

194
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,510
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

195
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,120
<font color="yellow">a little.</font>

196
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,120
<font color="yellow">That's why I warned you beforehand!</font>

197
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
<font color="yellow">I told you not to look at me,
or smile at me!</font>

198
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,510
<font color="yellow">You should've made it so that
things like this didn't happen</font>

199
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,120
<font color="yellow">even before you supposedly warned me!</font>

200
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,820
<font color="yellow">Right? As you said...</font>

201
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,320
<font color="yellow">"I'll take full responsibility if the
press releases information about us."</font>

202
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,410
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and take responsibility, then.</font>

203
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,510
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?
I thought you didn't want to marry me.</font>

204
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,510
<font color="yellow">And I definitely don't
want to marry you!</font>

205
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,010
<font color="yellow">I hate women who just kick me
like it's nothing!</font>

206
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,410
<font color="yellow">Did I say "let's get married?"
Huh? Did I?</font>

207
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,820
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm saying!</font>

208
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,910
<font color="yellow">Why are you so self-centered?</font>

209
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,620
<font color="yellow">You didn't even think of
apologizing, either.</font>

210
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,010
<font color="yellow">You still don't understand
what you did wrong?</font>

211
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,120
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

212
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,220
<font color="yellow">Oh, yeah!</font>

213
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,120
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

214
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,320
<font color="yellow">because of that kiss?</font>

215
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that it must have felt
nice for you too, though.</font>

216
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,510
<font color="yellow">Ow.</font>

217
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,320
<font color="yellow">Are you really going
to be like this? Huh?</font>

218
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
<font color="yellow">Teachers aren't
supposed to be so violent!</font>

219
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,910
<font color="yellow">They teach us to do this
when we encounter a pervert.</font>

220
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,410
<font color="yellow">I could kick you where
it really hurts, instead.</font>

221
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,510
<font color="yellow">Want me to do that?</font>

222
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,410
<font color="yellow">We need it by tomorrow.</font>

223
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,320
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

224
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,910
<font color="yellow">Well, um, yes.</font>

225
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,820
<font color="yellow">I'm supposed to be
at work right now, sir.</font>

226
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
<font color="yellow">I'm busy right now,
thanks to your grandson!</font>

227
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,020
<font color="yellow">That punk ignored my call again!</font>

228
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,620
<font color="yellow">We're getting calls from
everywhere right now!</font>

229
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,710
<font color="yellow">I think that he's meeting
with that teacher again today.</font>

230
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,910
<font color="yellow">And they met yesterday, too?</font>

231
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,710
<font color="yellow">He's doing great, then!</font>

232
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,820
<font color="yellow">He'd be a fool to let Da Hyun
slip through his fingers.</font>

233
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
<font color="yellow">But, um, why do you like her so much?</font>

234
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
<font color="yellow">I mean, I'm sure that we
could find a woman</font>

235
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,910
<font color="yellow">who's kinder, smarter, and
shapelier than her, if we look.</font>

236
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,210
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that's true.</font>

237
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,120
<font color="yellow">But those women won't
be able to change Jae In.</font>

238
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,710
<font color="yellow">In this world, there are certain people</font>

239
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:29,020
<font color="yellow">who make the people around them
change just because of their presence.</font>

240
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
<font color="yellow">Just like my late wife.</font>

241
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,320
<font color="yellow">Da Hyun will be able to
set that kid straight.</font>

242
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,410
<font color="yellow">The CEO won't change easily.</font>

243
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,320
<font color="yellow">He's changed quite a bit already.</font>

244
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,820
<font color="yellow">He's the only one unaware of that fact.</font>

245
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,910
<font color="yellow">What an idiot.</font>

246
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,410
<font color="yellow">This is the first time I've ever
received texts like these.</font>

247
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,710
<font color="yellow">You know that those emoticons
are stand-ins for curse words, right?</font>

248
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,820
<font color="yellow">It's not something to be laughing about.</font>

249
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,410
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this
bouquet of flowers?</font>

250
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,820
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty sure you didn't
buy them for me.</font>

251
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,710
<font color="yellow">It's not like you've
made yourself easy to love.</font>

252
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,120
<font color="yellow">Then... did you get these
from a guy, by any chance?</font>

253
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,820
<font color="yellow">Why are you curious about that?</font>

254
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,520
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you didn't go on a blind date.</font>

255
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,820
<font color="yellow">So who could it have been, then?</font>

256
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,320
<font color="yellow">It's not like you'd know,
even if I told you.</font>

257
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,910
<font color="yellow">And does that man know about me?</font>

258
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,410
<font color="yellow">Do you explain your arrangement with me
to every woman you're seeing?</font>

259
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,820
<font color="yellow">So... what you're saying is
that you met up with a guy.</font>

260
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
<font color="yellow">And not too long ago, at that.</font>

261
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:11,410
<font color="yellow">You know, I do think there's something
that I left out of the contract.</font>

262
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,410
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

263
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,020
<font color="yellow">Let's rewrite the contract.</font>

264
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,710
<font color="yellow">What do you mean,
let's rewrite it?</font>

265
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,120
<font color="yellow">No cheating on each other. Never.</font>

266
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,820
<font color="yellow">No putting on an innocent act,
only to stab me in the back later.</font>

267
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,120
<font color="yellow">You will not see any
other man besides me.</font>

268
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,820
<font color="yellow">When did I ever cheat on you?</font>

269
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,620
<font color="yellow">Define "see any other man."</font>

270
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,020
<font color="yellow">Don't even try to lie to me
and tell me you have male friends.</font>

271
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,520
<font color="yellow">So everyone else besides your family
is off-limits.</font>

272
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,710
<font color="yellow">Keep your distance even from guys you
may randomly encounter on the street.</font>

273
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,570
<font color="yellow">Then... are you going to keep your
distance from every other woman</font>

274
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,620
<font color="yellow">besides the women in your family
while dating me?</font>

275
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,320
<font color="yellow">You don't really have
to do that, though.</font>

276
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,910
<font color="yellow">So you're not going to see Lee Soo Jin,
Kang Mi Ra, or Yeon Seo Hui anymore?</font>

277
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,710
<font color="yellow">You should only believe one-tenth
of what you read online.</font>

278
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,120
<font color="yellow">Which one of them were you
actually dating, then?</font>

279
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,210
<font color="yellow">Is it true that you have a kid, too?</font>

280
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,210
<font color="yellow">I heard that you're having
your kid raised in the States!</font>

281
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,520
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be sued for defamation
and the spreading of false rumors?</font>

282
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,210
<font color="yellow">Well, fine, then. It's not like I'll be
your kid's mom, anyway.</font>

283
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,120
<font color="yellow">In exchange, you'd better
keep your hands off me.</font>

284
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,020
<font color="yellow">Don't grab my wrist
without permission, or k...</font>

285
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,710
<font color="yellow">Well, anyway, no physical contact!</font>

286
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,620
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

287
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,120
<font color="yellow">You've never dated a guy before,
have you?</font>

288
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,820
<font color="yellow">That's not true!</font>

289
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,520
<font color="yellow">Then did you only ever date eunuchs?</font>

290
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,210
<font color="yellow">You seem like you're unaware of this,
so let me fill you in.</font>

291
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,820
<font color="yellow">When a man and woman are dating, they
hold hands, kiss, and sleep together.</font>

292
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,120
<font color="yellow">That's what all couples do.</font>

293
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,020
<font color="yellow">It's all perfectly natural
among couples!</font>

294
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,820
<font color="yellow">How did I end up with
a playboy like you?</font>

295
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,120
<font color="yellow">You seem like you're unaware of this,
so let me fill you in.</font>

296
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,620
<font color="yellow">That's not what people
do when they're dating.</font>

297
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,820
<font color="yellow">That's what people do when
they actually like one another!</font>

298
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,710
<font color="yellow">So, what you're saying is...</font>

299
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,620
<font color="yellow">that you don't like me?</font>

300
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,210
<font color="yellow">Well, of course!</font>

301
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,120
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

302
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,820
<font color="yellow">Just keep being that way, then.</font>

303
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,520
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare fall for me!</font>

304
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,120
<font color="yellow">Things will get quite
complicated if you do.</font>

305
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,710
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to say!</font>

306
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,120
<font color="yellow">Well, whatever.</font>

307
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,210
<font color="yellow">We've met today, so let's count this
as our official meeting for the week.</font>

308
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,620
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

309
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,020
<font color="yellow">We have to meet more often
than once a week.</font>

310
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,410
<font color="yellow">It's not based on the
frequency of our meetings.</font>

311
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,120
<font color="yellow">What's important is establishing
and maintaining some regularity.</font>

312
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,020
<font color="yellow">It's a bit stuffy in here, let's go.</font>

313
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,020
<font color="yellow">Hey, that's mine!</font>

314
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,820
<font color="yellow">Hey! That's my bouquet!
No! Stop it!</font>

315
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,120
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

316
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,710
<font color="yellow">Do other people know
how terrible a person you are?</font>

317
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,210
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

318
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,910
<font color="yellow">But I don't care.</font>

319
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,520
<font color="yellow">Why a concert hall, of all places?</font>

320
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,620
<font color="yellow">My hotel is a sponsor.</font>

321
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,520
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

322
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,410
<font color="yellow">Do you hate musicals and plays
on top of classical music, too?</font>

323
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,520
<font color="yellow">No.
That's not it.</font>

324
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,910
<font color="yellow">You've never dated a woman before,
have you?</font>

325
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,410
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

326
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,620
<font color="yellow">Figures, since you still look like you're
a normal person, despite everything.</font>

327
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,410
<font color="yellow">So you did date women.</font>

328
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,820
<font color="yellow">But you always got dumped, right?</font>

329
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,410
<font color="yellow">Is that why you're so
damaged a human being?</font>

330
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,520
<font color="yellow">What kind of ridiculousness is that?</font>

331
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,410
<font color="yellow">I've never been dumped by a woman
in my life.</font>

332
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,620
<font color="yellow">You probably got dumped without
realizing that you got dumped.</font>

333
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
<font color="yellow">Let me be real for a second.</font>

334
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that those women
probably didn't like you much, either.</font>

335
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,210
<font color="yellow">They probably liked your title, though.</font>

336
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,320
<font color="yellow">And how are you so sure about that?</font>

337
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,410
<font color="yellow">Because you're doing work
in the middle of a date!</font>

338
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,120
<font color="yellow">Who'd like a man like that?</font>

339
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
<font color="yellow">I mean, this is something
that I have to do, anyway!</font>

340
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,520
<font color="yellow">I'm killing two birds with one stone.
And I'm saving time.</font>

341
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,120
<font color="yellow">What a relief.</font>

342
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,820
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

343
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,520
<font color="yellow">Because you most certainly
haven't fallen for me.</font>

344
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,520
<font color="yellow">There isn't a single
person on this planet</font>

345
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,410
<font color="yellow">who tries to be frugal with their time
when seeing someone they like.</font>

346
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,710
<font color="yellow">If anything, they go out of their way
to make time.</font>

347
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,520
<font color="yellow">Well, fine.
Keep being like that.</font>

348
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,120
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare fall for me.</font>

349
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that won't be
an easy feat, though.</font>

350
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,820
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

351
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,620
<font color="yellow">Well, whatever.
Let's go.</font>

352
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,620
<font color="yellow">Wait, where?</font>

353
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,820
<font color="yellow">We went to the concert last time like
you wanted, so it's my turn to choose.</font>

354
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,020
<font color="yellow">That's only fair.
Come on.</font>

355
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,120
<font color="yellow">I should've said hello to the
stage director, at the very least!</font>

356
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,710
<font color="yellow">You can go do that by yourself later.</font>

357
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,820
<font color="yellow">How dare you hold my hand!</font>

358
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,820
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

359
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,820
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

360
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,620
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Go up.</font>

361
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,020
<font color="yellow">You... want to go in here?</font>

362
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,910
<font color="yellow">We have to save time, after all.
Killing two birds with one stone.</font>

363
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,120
<font color="yellow">- This is what you really want?
- I told you, yes!</font>

364
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,910
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're a child!
You're not 10 years old!</font>

365
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,910
<font color="yellow">The kids that I teach are 10 years old.</font>

366
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,710
<font color="yellow">Come on.
Let's go.</font>

367
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,120
<font color="yellow">You should really reconsider this.</font>

368
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,320
<font color="yellow">Why? I feel like this will be fun.</font>

369
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,120
<font color="yellow">You never did things like this
as a child?</font>

370
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,620
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

371
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,620
<font color="yellow">What did you do, then?</font>

372
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,910
<font color="yellow">I took lessons in violin, cello,
golf, swimming, ballet, and Spanish.</font>

373
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,910
<font color="yellow">Wow, that's totally different
than what I did growing up.</font>

374
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,320
<font color="yellow">What did you study?</font>

375
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,120
<font color="yellow">I played soccer, took piano
lessons for two months</font>

376
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,710
<font color="yellow">watched cartoons,
and played with paper dolls.</font>

377
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,910
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's my first time
making a model, too.</font>

378
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,320
<font color="yellow">So then, why did you...</font>

379
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,710
<font color="yellow">Because the kids in
my class will like it.</font>

380
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,910
<font color="yellow">Buy me that, Mom!
I want it!</font>

381
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,410
<font color="yellow">No. Let's go.</font>

382
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,320
<font color="yellow">But I want it!</font>

383
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,820
<font color="yellow">If you keep misbehaving,
I'm just going to leave you here!</font>

384
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,120
<font color="yellow">You want to live with the owner
of this store? And I'll get a new son?</font>

385
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,320
<font color="yellow">But still!
Buy it for me!</font>

386
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,120
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

387
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,710
<font color="yellow">- Come on!
- Hey! Let's go.</font>

388
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,520
<font color="yellow">Hurry it up!</font>

389
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,910
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Are you sleeping with your eyes open?</font>

390
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,210
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not asleep.</font>

391
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,320
<font color="yellow">You're not sick, are you?</font>

392
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,120
<font color="yellow">Or do you hate doing this that much?</font>

393
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,710
<font color="yellow">Should... we leave, then?</font>

394
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,710
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

395
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,410
<font color="yellow">Just keep working on this.
I'll go buy some drinks.</font>

396
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,710
<font color="yellow">He's such a weird guy.</font>

397
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,210
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and buy it for me, Mom!</font>

398
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,120
<font color="yellow">You're really not going
to listen to your mom?</font>

399
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,320
<font color="yellow">Come on!
Buy it for me!</font>

400
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,120
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

401
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,620
<font color="yellow">Here kid.</font>

402
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,620
<font color="yellow">Make sure to obey your mom, okay?</font>

403
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,210
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

404
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,520
<font color="yellow">It seems that Jae In has himself
another girlfriend.</font>

405
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
<font color="yellow">You saw them, too?</font>

406
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, I happened to stumble upon them.</font>

407
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,120
<font color="yellow">How is it that he has a different girl
on his arm almost every day?</font>

408
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,620
<font color="yellow">It'd be even weirder for him to not
have a girlfriend at his age.</font>

409
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,820
<font color="yellow">It's not bad for him to do
everything he wants to do</font>

410
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,120
<font color="yellow">before going to work
at the main SH Group branch.</font>

411
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,620
<font color="yellow">The main SH Group branch?</font>

412
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,620
<font color="yellow">Of course. Jae In won't be at
that hotel forever, you know.</font>

413
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,210
<font color="yellow">No matter what anyone says, Jae In
is the eldest son of this household.</font>

414
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,710
<font color="yellow">I'm my father's child too, you know.</font>

415
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,520
<font color="yellow">It's not just my older brother
who's my father's child!</font>

416
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,710
<font color="yellow">Tae Ha is a blood relative of
my father, just like Jae In is!</font>

417
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
<font color="yellow">Did I ever say otherwise?</font>

418
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,520
<font color="yellow">What's important is his skill, anyway.</font>

419
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:55,520
<font color="yellow">You know, Jae In is my
brother's son, not yours.</font>

420
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,520
<font color="yellow">You two don't even share
a single drop of blood.</font>

421
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,910
<font color="yellow">He won't become your son just because
you keep hanging around him.</font>

422
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,620
<font color="yellow">Young Miss!</font>

423
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,020
<font color="yellow">Watch your words.</font>

424
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,910
<font color="yellow">It won't benefit you in the slightest
to get on my bad side.</font>

425
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,410
<font color="yellow">I have SH Mall shares too, you know.</font>

426
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,910
<font color="yellow">Stop it, already!
How annoying.</font>

427
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,120
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

428
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,710
<font color="yellow">Why are you still here?</font>

429
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,710
<font color="yellow">Were you planning to eat here
before you left?</font>

430
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,620
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, sir.</font>

431
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,910
<font color="yellow">As I told you before,
Jae In is my son now.</font>

432
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,520
<font color="yellow">And he's also the grandson of the
chairman of Daehan Electric.</font>

433
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,620
<font color="yellow">I'd like it if you didn't forget that.</font>

434
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,710
<font color="yellow">Why does that punk
take after you so much?</font>

435
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,820
<font color="yellow">He might as well have been
born from your belly instead.</font>

436
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,710
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

437
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,620
<font color="yellow">That punk is ten times
more wicked than I am.</font>

438
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,520
<font color="yellow">Is a piece missing?
Why won't it fit?</font>

439
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,620
<font color="yellow">Drink up.</font>

440
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:48,820
<font color="yellow">Did you know that kid
you bought the model set for?</font>

441
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,520
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

442
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,020
<font color="yellow">Then why...</font>

443
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,620
<font color="yellow">Because his whining was so annoying.</font>

444
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,410
<font color="yellow">When are you planning to leave?
It's been an hour already.</font>

445
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,710
<font color="yellow">I think the instructions are wrong.
Everything is rolling around!</font>

446
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:12,820
<font color="yellow">Don't do this in front of kids.</font>

447
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,520
<font color="yellow">Kids think that their teachers
are good at everything, after all.</font>

448
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,620
<font color="yellow">Wow, it looks like you
really have a knack for this!</font>

449
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,620
<font color="yellow">Even kids can make these just fine.
It's just you that can't, DaDa.</font>

450
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,210
<font color="yellow"><i>[SUITABLE FOR AGES 10 AND UP]</i></font>

451
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,820
<font color="yellow">Oh, it looks like a sudden downpour.</font>

452
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,120
<font color="yellow">Looks that way.</font>

453
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,710
<font color="yellow">It'll probably stop soon, right?</font>

454
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,820
<font color="yellow">Here, a present.</font>

455
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,620
<font color="yellow">It's new, so try making this
when you have some time.</font>

456
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,810
<font color="yellow">Who knows?
It might be fun.</font>

457
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,810
<font color="yellow">I'm busy.</font>

458
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,920
<font color="yellow">Yeah, so when you have time.</font>

459
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,810
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's not stopping.</font>

460
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,710
<font color="yellow">Should we just make a
run for it to the parking lot?</font>

461
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,620
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

462
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,210
<font color="yellow">- Did you borrow that?
- Yeah.</font>

463
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,210
<font color="yellow">You should've borrowed one more!</font>

464
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,420
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

465
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,210
<font color="yellow">Oh my!</font>

466
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,810
<font color="yellow">I heard that working on model figures
is good for concentration and creativity</font>

467
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,520
<font color="yellow">Geez!</font>

468
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,020
<font color="yellow">Does that mean you lack both
concentration and creativity, DaDa?</font>

469
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,310
<font color="yellow">Why, you...</font>

470
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,520
<font color="yellow">Oh, you really are horrid, you know!</font>

471
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,520
<font color="yellow">It'll just be your loss
if you try to run off, you know.</font>

472
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,620
<font color="yellow">You're the one with bad concentration!</font>

473
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,420
<font color="yellow">I'm creative, though, so it's okay
if I lack concentration.</font>

474
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,920
<font color="yellow">Oh, geez!</font>

475
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,520
<font color="yellow"><i>I heard you got yourself a man.
Your mom is over the moon about it.</i></font>

476
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,310
<font color="yellow"><i>But still, she said that you two can't
live together before getting married.</i></font>

477
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,810
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm really busy as of late because of a
really important and serious matter.</i></font>

478
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,020
<font color="yellow"><i>Bye.</i></font>

479
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,710
<font color="yellow"><i>Lee Jae In of SH Group?</i></font>

480
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,310
<font color="yellow"><i>- Lee Jae In?
- The Prince?</i></font>

481
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,520
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you look into the woman
who's dating Jae In?</i></font>

482
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,620
<font color="yellow"><i>Forget about everything else.
We need to know more about her.</i></font>

483
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,520
<font color="yellow"><i>My younger sister is
DaDa's best friend.</i></font>

484
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
<font color="yellow"><i>We don't exactly have an
average relationship, either!</i></font>

485
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
<font color="yellow"><i>Isn't that right?</i></font>

486
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,420
<font color="yellow"><i>- You're like the Demon King!
- Demon King?</i></font>

487
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,120
<font color="yellow"><i>You two have kissed already though,
right?</i></font>

488
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,810
<font color="yellow"><i>Um, what are you doing?</i></font>

489
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,020
<font color="yellow"><i>Kissing you.</i></font>
