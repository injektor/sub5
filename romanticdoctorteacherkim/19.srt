00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:08,673
<font color="yellow">Can you tell me?</font>

2
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:10,643
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

3
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:14,943
<font color="yellow">push my father's operation back?</font>

4
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:21,013
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you. Why did you push my father's operation back?</font>

5
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:30,143
<font color="yellow">I just heard...</font>

6
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:33,313
<font color="yellow">that the hospital would take care of it. That's all I know.</font>

7
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:35,943
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

8
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:37,573
<font color="yellow">Was there anything else?</font>

9
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:41,173
<font color="yellow">I heard the amount of the damage was...</font>

10
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:42,743
<font color="yellow">around 200,000 dollars.</font>

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,843
<font color="yellow">Right. It was about that.</font>

12
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:47,813
<font color="yellow">It was 14 years ago...</font>

13
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:49,843
<font color="yellow">and It was an obscene amount of money back then.</font>

14
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:53,213
<font color="yellow">Did they let it slide without charging you any of it?</font>

15
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:56,173
<font color="yellow">We were investigated by the police, though.</font>

16
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:59,843
<font color="yellow">In the meantime, we were informed of their decision.</font>

17
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:03,613
<font color="yellow">They said they'd drop the charges and wouldn't seek compensation.</font>

18
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,243
<font color="yellow">All of a sudden?</font>

19
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:07,113
<font color="yellow">Did they say that with no apparent reason or trigger?</font>

20
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:08,373
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

21
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:12,213
<font color="yellow">Maybe that was because my husband died in the hospital...</font>

22
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:14,113
<font color="yellow">or my son was too young.</font>

23
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,473
<font color="yellow">Things just worked out like that.</font>

24
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:20,443
<font color="yellow">That's all I know and nothing more.</font>

25
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:22,243
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

26
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:25,043
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

27
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:28,213
<font color="yellow">Thank you anyway.</font>

28
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,143
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

29
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:34,113
<font color="yellow">- What is your son's name? - Pardon?</font>

30
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:35,913
<font color="yellow">He's Kang Dong Joo, right?</font>

31
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:38,173
<font color="yellow">He used to work at Geodae Hospital,</font>

32
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:41,013
<font color="yellow">and he is now working as a surgeon at Doldam Hospital.</font>

33

<font color="yellow">Do you know what is the easiest thing in this world?</font>

34
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:51,243
<font color="yellow">It's breaking a relationship.</font>

35
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:53,413
<font color="yellow">It doesn't require...</font>

36
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:55,773
<font color="yellow">any money nor effort.</font>

37
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:58,343
<font color="yellow">You can do it with a word.</font>

38
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:04,673
<font color="yellow">You are being...</font>

39
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:07,443
<font color="yellow">fooled right now.</font>

40
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:10,313
<font color="yellow">Did you know...</font>

41
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:13,243
<font color="yellow">the patient whose operation was pushed back...</font>

42
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:18,043
<font color="yellow">was my father?</font>

43
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,113
<font color="yellow">Did you know that?</font>

44
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,243
<font color="yellow">Yes, I remember that operation.</font>

45
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,543
<font color="yellow">I was on duty that night.</font>

46
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:49,643
<font color="yellow">Two patients with dissection and cardiac infarction...</font>

47
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:53,013

48
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:55,243
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

49
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,513
<font color="yellow">was that you...</font>

50
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:03,913
<font color="yellow">who pushed my father's operation back for a VIP patient?</font>

51
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:07,913
<font color="yellow">It was not President Do.</font>

52
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:11,373
<font color="yellow">It was you, right?</font>

53
00:03:14,643 --> 00:03:15,643
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

54
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,843
<font color="yellow">It was my decision.</font>

55
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:27,143
<font color="yellow">The risk of death for a patient...</font>

56
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:30,873
<font color="yellow">with acute aortic dissection rises by one percent every hour.</font>

57
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,273
<font color="yellow">There were a patient with cardiac infarction...</font>

58
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,473
<font color="yellow">whose probability of dying within one hour was 99 percent...</font>

59
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:43,173
<font color="yellow">and a patient with dissection whose probability rises gradually.</font>

60
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:46,543
<font color="yellow">They both came to the hospital at a five-minute interval.</font>

61
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:48,043
<font color="yellow">If you were there,</font>

62
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:51,773
<font color="yellow">which patient would you operate on first, Dong Joo?</font>

63
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:57,573
<font color="yellow">It was not because he was a VIP patient.</font>

64
00:03:58,343 --> 00:03:59,813
<font color="yellow">I made that decision...</font>

65
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:02,173
<font color="yellow">in the order of emergency.</font>

66
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,143

70
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,473
<font color="yellow">Ask Dr. Nam...</font>

71
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:23,913
<font color="yellow">to take care of the patient with colitis.</font>

72
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:26,743
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yang will treat the patient with aortic dissection.</font>

73
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:29,913
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim. I will go tell them.</font>

74
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:39,573
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

75

<font color="yellow">If you can't,</font>

77
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:48,843
<font color="yellow">ask Dr. Do to perform it.</font>

78
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:51,543
<font color="yellow">I will do that.</font>

79
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:55,913
<font color="yellow">I will perform the operation.</font>

81

<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.</font>

82

410
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:35,073

425
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:13,343

426
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,813
<font color="yellow">It took a load off my shoulders.</font>

<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

439
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:52,243

440
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,573

444
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:13,273

445
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:15,913
<font color="yellow">Right. I want you to go on duty in the emergency room...</font>

00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:35,513
<font color="yellow">I can't leave the hospital.</font>

454

455

456

466

<font color="yellow">When are you going to neglect my husband just like that?</font>

467
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:16,443
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, we are not neglecting your husband.</font>

468

00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,743
<font color="yellow">Why do you let him stay in there instead?</font>

470
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:25,243
<font color="yellow">Like I said, we don't have a bed available in the ICU yet.</font>

471
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:26,243
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

472
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:28,673
<font color="yellow">Where's my husband's doctor?</font>

473
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:30,843
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to the doctor.</font>

474
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:39,973
<font color="yellow">Did you make up with Master Kim yet?</font>

475
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,573
<font color="yellow">You don't wish to talk about that, right?</font>

476
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:49,943
<font color="yellow">I get it.</font>

477
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:54,773
<font color="yellow">By the way, your mother just called.</font>

478
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:56,213
<font color="yellow">She asked if you were doing okay.</font>

479
00:30:56,943 --> 00:30:59,143
<font color="yellow">Did you talk to my mother on the phone?</font>

480
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:00,143
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

481
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:02,443
<font color="yellow">I heard your phone ringing.</font>

482
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:05,273
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell her you were in the operating room.</font>

483
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:07,873
<font color="yellow">Was there anything else apart from that?</font>

484
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:10,113
<font color="yellow">She talked about some side dishes...</font>

485
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:12,213
<font color="yellow">and corns?</font>

486
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:16,273
<font color="yellow">Can you have a conversation about those things?</font>

487
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:17,373
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

488
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:18,773
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

489
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:23,113
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang. We have a problem. A patient is having a fit.</font>

490
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:30,073
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

491
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:33,073
<font color="yellow">He started struggling all of a sudden. It seems he's having a fit.</font>

492
00:31:37,873 --> 00:31:40,343
<font color="yellow">Administer 4mg of lorazepam through IV line.</font>

493
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:41,443
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

494
00:31:52,373 --> 00:31:53,413
<font color="yellow">Administered.</font>

495
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:55,843
<font color="yellow">- He suffers from alcoholism, right? - Yes.</font>

496
00:31:55,943 --> 00:31:57,613
<font color="yellow">I think it is delirium tremens.</font>

497
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:01,443
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang, his heart rate is 180.</font>

498
00:32:01,843 --> 00:32:02,943
<font color="yellow">Administer another ampoule of lorazepam.</font>

499
00:32:02,973 --> 00:32:03,973
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor. Kang.</font>

500
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:11,243
<font color="yellow">His heart rate is not dropping.</font>

501
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:12,843
<font color="yellow">Administer another ampoule of lorazepam...</font>

502
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:15,413
<font color="yellow">- and inject 200mg of phenobarbital. - Okay.</font>

503
00:32:15,473 --> 00:32:17,413
<font color="yellow">Inject 100mg of scyamine, too.</font>

504
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:18,413
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

505
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:21,873
<font color="yellow">Sir. Sir!</font>

506
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:23,913
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

507
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:29,473
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am, may I speak with you? - What's wrong with my husband?</font>

508
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:33,043
<font color="yellow">Did something go wrong with the operation?</font>

509
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:35,673
<font color="yellow">No, there's no problem about the operation.</font>

510
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:36,843
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

511
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:40,643
<font color="yellow">he's showing serious alcohol withdrawal symptoms.</font>

512
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:43,843
<font color="yellow">It's called delirium tremens.</font>

513
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:45,613
<font color="yellow">Delirium tremens?</font>

514
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:48,943
<font color="yellow">We are trying to control it with medication.</font>

515
00:32:49,443 --> 00:32:51,113
<font color="yellow">But it's not working well.</font>

516
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:54,473
<font color="yellow">If the condition continues,</font>

517
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,543
<font color="yellow">- he may have a cardiac arrest. - Goodness.</font>

518
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:02,043
<font color="yellow">Please save my husband.</font>

519
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:06,213
<font color="yellow">He's not a good husband, but I can't live without him.</font>

520
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:08,713
<font color="yellow">Doctor, you are here.</font>

521
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:12,813
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, until when are you going to neglect my husband in the ER?</font>

522
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:14,643
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - I mean,</font>

523
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,843
<font color="yellow">I'm already upset with the fact that his operation was pushed back.</font>

524
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:18,673
<font color="yellow">And now he can't be treated in the ICU?</font>

525
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:19,843
<font color="yellow">Ma'am,</font>

526
00:33:20,313 --> 00:33:22,813
<font color="yellow">didn't the chief nurse explain about that?</font>

527
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:25,943
<font color="yellow">We don't have any bed available in the ICU now.</font>

528
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:28,143
<font color="yellow">We have patients who had an operation before your husband.</font>

529
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:29,743
<font color="yellow">And they both are in a critical condition.</font>

530
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:32,213
<font color="yellow">Then you shouldn't have accepted a patient in the first place.</font>

531
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,873
<font color="yellow">We had no choice as two emergency patients came in at the same time.</font>

532
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:39,673
<font color="yellow">We asked for your understanding already.</font>

533
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:42,073
<font color="yellow">And your husband is making good progress after the operation.</font>

534
00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:44,513
<font color="yellow">So we were going to move him to a patient's room anyway.</font>

535
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:45,613
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

536
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:48,773
<font color="yellow">Send my husband to the Intensive Care Unit now.</font>

537
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:50,773
<font color="yellow">- Right now. - Excuse me.</font>

538
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,913
<font color="yellow">- This is just too much. - What did you say?</font>

539
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:55,473
<font color="yellow">My husband didn't have...</font>

540
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:58,443
<font color="yellow">an operation on time because of your husband.</font>

541
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:02,443
<font color="yellow">And now you want to take his bed in the ICU?</font>

542
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:04,913
<font color="yellow">What does that mean, ma'am?</font>

543
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:07,973
<font color="yellow">I heard what the doctors said yesterday.</font>

544
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,943
<font color="yellow">I heard that...</font>

545
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,913
<font color="yellow">you'd give my husband's operation a lick and a promise because of him.</font>

546
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:17,313
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what are you talking about?</font>

547
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:21,673
<font color="yellow">My husband's operation was pushed back because of your husband.</font>

548
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,013
<font color="yellow">You are the one who cut in line.</font>

549
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:26,513
<font color="yellow">- What did you way? - Don't be ridiculous.</font>

550
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:27,873
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - What's that?</font>

551
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:29,673
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

552
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:32,813
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, there seems to be some misunderstanding.</font>

553
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:35,673
<font color="yellow">I never give an operation a lick and a promise.</font>

554
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:38,243
<font color="yellow">I told you that we did our best.</font>

555
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,343
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

556
00:34:39,873 --> 00:34:42,473
<font color="yellow">It's a doctor who determines the order of emergency.</font>

557
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:43,843
<font color="yellow">That's it. That's enough.</font>

558
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:47,473
<font color="yellow">Just send my husband to the Intensive Care Unit right now.</font>

559
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,083
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I will sue this hospital.</font>

560
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:51,343
<font color="yellow">Send him immediately.</font>

561
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:53,213
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang. He's having a cardiac arrest.</font>

562
00:34:57,373 --> 00:34:58,543
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

563
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:01,173
<font color="yellow">Bring me the VPB and defibrillator now.</font>

564
00:35:01,173 --> 00:35:02,173
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

565
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:11,543
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

566
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:22,373
<font color="yellow">Let me.</font>

567
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:25,373
<font color="yellow">Charge 200J.</font>

568
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,313
<font color="yellow">Step away. Shock.</font>

569
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:35,473
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

570
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:37,973
<font color="yellow">Give him 1mg of epinephrine every three minute.</font>

571
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:39,043
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

572
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:41,943
<font color="yellow">I'll check his heart rhythm.</font>

573
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,543
<font color="yellow">- Ventricular fibrillation. - Charge 200J.</font>

574
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:49,673
<font color="yellow">Shock.</font>

575
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:54,473
<font color="yellow">What's going on with him?</font>

576
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:58,973
<font color="yellow">- I will switch with him. - Okay.</font>

577
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:10,013
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

578
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,213
<font color="yellow">It's been almost an hour.</font>

579
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,313
<font color="yellow">Are you injecting epinephrine every three minutes?</font>

580
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:28,973
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

581
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:12,173
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

582
00:37:22,513 --> 00:37:23,643
<font color="yellow">Patient Lee Dong Soo...</font>

583
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:27,743
<font color="yellow">has passed away.</font>

584
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:30,743
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

585
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:34,213
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

586
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:45,643
<font color="yellow">Why did you say he needs operation...</font>

587
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,213
<font color="yellow">if you weren't even going to save him?</font>

588
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:54,913
<font color="yellow">If you performed the operation well,</font>

589
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,273
<font color="yellow">my husband wouldn't have died.</font>

590
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:01,973
<font color="yellow">Bring him back.</font>

591
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:05,943
<font color="yellow">Bring my husband back now.</font>

592
00:38:07,373 --> 00:38:08,473
<font color="yellow">Now.</font>

593
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:10,843
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

594
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:14,013
<font color="yellow">It wasn't because of the operation. It was because of alcohol.</font>

595
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:18,313
<font color="yellow">He died of delirium tremens.</font>

596
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:20,713
<font color="yellow">He walked in here just yesterday.</font>

597
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:22,813
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this happened over the night.</font>

598
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:24,773
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

599
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:26,843
<font color="yellow">Bring him back.</font>

600
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:30,273
<font color="yellow">Bring my husband back.</font>

601
00:38:30,913 --> 00:38:33,083
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

602
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:36,083
<font color="yellow">Please bring him back, Doctor.</font>

603
00:38:37,143 --> 00:38:38,173
<font color="yellow">Please calm down.</font>

604
00:38:39,143 --> 00:38:41,013
<font color="yellow">We will give you time to say goodbye to him.</font>

605
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:44,543
<font color="yellow">You should say your last farewell.</font>

606
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:48,443
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

607
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:05,643
<font color="yellow">I guess, now,</font>

608
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:10,273
<font color="yellow">your husband can be moved to the ICU.</font>

609
00:39:28,473 --> 00:39:30,243
<font color="yellow">What was with your attitude back there?</font>

610
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:32,873
<font color="yellow">Why would you get angry with the guardians?</font>

611
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:34,873
<font color="yellow">She kept doubting the operation I performed.</font>

612
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,343
<font color="yellow">I tried my absolute best.</font>

613
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:42,083
<font color="yellow">I tried my absolute best to find the bowel infarction...</font>

614
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,173
<font color="yellow">and I tried my absolute best to remove that piece of glass.</font>

615
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,443
<font color="yellow">It's not my fault that the ICU is full.</font>

616
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:50,613
<font color="yellow">It's not my fault that he drank a lot.</font>

617
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:53,043
<font color="yellow">Why would she put the blame on my operation? Why?</font>

618
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:56,743
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

619
00:39:57,773 --> 00:39:59,973
<font color="yellow">You want to yell at me like I did.</font>

620
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:02,083
<font color="yellow">You want to say...</font>

621
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:05,473
<font color="yellow">you had no other option to make that decision about my dad.</font>
