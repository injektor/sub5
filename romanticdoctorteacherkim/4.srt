00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:57,786
<font color="yellow">The only person on the emergency medicine board here is her.</font>

158
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,616
<font color="yellow">Should she be just sitting around doing nothing for the patient?</font>

159
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:05,716
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

160
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:09,046
<font color="yellow">I should do anything and everything at such an emergency.</font>

161
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,916
<font color="yellow">Nonsense.</font>

162
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:13,486
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

163
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:15,346
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

164
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:19,746
<font color="yellow">It looks like you believe you were really heroic...</font>

165
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:23,786
<font color="yellow">to bring in Seo Jung for help in such an emergency.</font>

166
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:25,546
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

167
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,516
<font color="yellow">You're a coward who can't react quickly.</font>

168
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:32,586
<font color="yellow">Here you go again.</font>

169
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,686
<font color="yellow">Did you just call me a coward?</font>

170
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:40,086
<font color="yellow">Look. You have worked so hard to become the top of your class...</font>

171
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:42,846
<font color="yellow">and you can't let go of Geodae Hospital's name.</font>

172
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,816
<font color="yellow">It's all because you're a coward.</font>

173
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,816
<font color="yellow">If you don't have those to fall back on,</font>

174
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,116
<font color="yellow">you're just anxious.</font>

175
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:52,686
<font color="yellow">Are you done?</font>

176
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,816
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you angry?</font>

177
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:02,816
<font color="yellow">Then don't ever be pretentious in front of me.</font>

178
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,216
<font color="yellow">Pretending to be someone. Pretending to know.</font>

179
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:06,946
<font color="yellow">Pretending to be a righteous doctor.</font>

180
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,046
<font color="yellow">Pretending to be a hero after doing just your job.</font>

181
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:11,916
<font color="yellow">I never did any of those.</font>

182
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:13,546
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

183
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,546
<font color="yellow">You didn't bring Seo Jung in because of the patient.</font>

184
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:19,346
<font color="yellow">You needed her for yourself.</font>

185
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:23,146
<font color="yellow">You didn't want to look like a fool while treating that burn patient.</font>

186
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:25,146
<font color="yellow">You didn't want to be ashamed in front of our staff.</font>

187
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:28,486
<font color="yellow">And now you're here pretending to look out for Seo Jung...</font>

188
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:30,716
<font color="yellow">and pretending like it was for the patient.</font>

189
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:33,886
<font color="yellow">Stop blabbering about yourself.</font>

190
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:35,316
<font color="yellow">Understood?</font>

191
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:40,046
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

192
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:55,886
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

193
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,916
<font color="yellow">What's with you? What?</font>

194
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:02,446
<font color="yellow">If you got nothing, I'm leaving.</font>

195
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,586
<font color="yellow">Forgive me, Master Kim.</font>

196
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:13,316
<font color="yellow">Please give me another chance. I promise I'll do well.</font>

197
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:17,286
<font color="yellow">I'm serious. I will never put you down.</font>

198
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:18,786
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

199
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:21,086
<font color="yellow">- Get up right now. - No.</font>

200
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,116
<font color="yellow">I'm not moving an inch...</font>

201
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:26,386
<font color="yellow">until you forgive me.</font>

202
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,416
<font color="yellow">I won't move.</font>

203
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,846
<font color="yellow">Go ahead, then.</font>

204
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:50,216
<font color="yellow">You coward.</font>

205
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,586
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

206
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:57,846
<font color="yellow">Kang Dong...</font>

207
00:14:58,546 --> 00:14:59,546
<font color="yellow">Stay here.</font>

208
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,216
<font color="yellow">Don't step in.</font>

209
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:03,346
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

210
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,586
<font color="yellow">That's enough, okay?</font>

211
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,316
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

212
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:30,486
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything about me. Don't talk about me like that!</font>

213
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,716
<font color="yellow">I know you're older than me,</font>

214
00:15:34,286 --> 00:15:35,386
<font color="yellow">but it doesn't mean that you're wiser.</font>

215
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:40,516
<font color="yellow">If you're old, can you ignore young people like this?</font>

216
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:42,546
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

217
00:15:42,986 --> 00:15:46,116
<font color="yellow">You don't even know a thing about me.</font>

218
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:51,786
<font color="yellow">If you're an adult, you shouldn't talk like that.</font>

219
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:54,646
<font color="yellow">Exactly. Adults shouldn't talk like that.</font>

220
00:15:57,046 --> 00:16:00,216
<font color="yellow">I am older, but I may not be the wisest.</font>

221
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,716
<font color="yellow">And I don't know anything about you. However,</font>

222
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,216
<font color="yellow">if you reach my age,</font>

223
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:12,086
<font color="yellow">you'll begin to see something.</font>

224
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:14,916
<font color="yellow">You'll be able to see if someone's sincere or not.</font>

225
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:18,846
<font color="yellow">You'll also be able to see if someone as a future or not.</font>

226
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:19,916
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

227
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,816
<font color="yellow">I'm not sincere?</font>

228
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:24,686
<font color="yellow">And that I don't have a future?</font>

229
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,846
<font color="yellow">You probably know that better.</font>

230
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,916
<font color="yellow">Hey, let go.</font>

231
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:36,916
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

232
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:41,046
<font color="yellow">- Seriously... - Let go. Let go of me.</font>

233
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,286
<font color="yellow">Mr. Go, let go of him.</font>

234
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:45,446
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

235
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:47,916
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Dr. Kang. You're at the hospital.</font>

236
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,016
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill him today.</font>

237
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,446
<font color="yellow">Darn you. I'll kill you.</font>

238
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:57,146
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

239
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:03,446
<font color="yellow">Myung Sim started again.</font>

240
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:07,216
<font color="yellow">What? Started again?</font>

241
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:12,386
<font color="yellow">This is the moment when Myung Sim looks the sexiest.</font>

242
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:16,156
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing?</font>

243
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:20,416
<font color="yellow">This is a hospital and we still have patients.</font>

244
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,186
<font color="yellow">That's exactly what I'm saying.</font>

245
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:24,886
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mr. Go. Get rid of him.</font>

246
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:26,316
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Master Kim.</font>

247
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,516
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard Dr. Kang worked...</font>

248
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:31,386
<font color="yellow">at the emergency room today?</font>

249
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,446
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard he worked...</font>

250
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:36,546
<font color="yellow">in this lagging environment with lagging equipment...</font>

251
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,386
<font color="yellow">with his lack of experiences?</font>

252
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:41,686
<font color="yellow">No one else could have done better than what he did.</font>

253
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:45,416
<font color="yellow">You should be praising him, not bashing on him.</font>

254
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,346
<font color="yellow">You were getting beaten while he was working.</font>

255
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:52,516
<font color="yellow">Come on, Ms Oh. That's true, but...</font>

256
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:54,486
<font color="yellow">Look at Dr. Yoon's incident.</font>

257
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:58,116
<font color="yellow">President Yeo asked and Mr. Nam asked.</font>

258
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:02,656
<font color="yellow">On top of that, Dr. Yoon kneeled down with all sincerity.</font>

259
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:04,986
<font color="yellow">You should step back...</font>

260
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:07,716
<font color="yellow">after a while, too.</font>

261
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,656
<font color="yellow">How can you be so harsh?</font>

262
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:15,686
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon has worked with us for so long.</font>

263

264
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:21,046
<font color="yellow">Come on, Ms. Oh. About that...</font>

265
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:22,086
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it.</font>

266
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:25,086
<font color="yellow">Please reconsider your decision...</font>

269
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:33,386

00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:48,846
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

311
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:52,286
<font color="yellow">- It's my letter of resignation. - What?</font>

312
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:53,816
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

313
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,546
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'm the right doctor...</font>

314
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,686
<font color="yellow">you're looking for here at this hospital.</font>

315
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,146
<font color="yellow">I'm not cut out for it, too.</font>

316
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,446
<font color="yellow">- That's all I needed to hear. - Please, Master Kim.</font>

317
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:07,846
<font color="yellow">You can't do this. Please think about it again.</font>

318
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:11,216
<font color="yellow">There's so much for you to do here at this hospital.</font>

319
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:14,916
<font color="yellow">I completely understand why you're upset.</font>

320
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:17,786
<font color="yellow">At least stay here before you go back to Geodae Hospital.</font>

321
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:20,316
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for other places rather than Geodae Hospital.</font>

322
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:26,116
<font color="yellow">I already got offered by a couple of hospitals.</font>

323
00:22:26,986 --> 00:22:29,316
<font color="yellow">That's good news. Off you go, then.</font>

324
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,846
<font color="yellow">Master Kim. Sit down.</font>

325
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:33,216
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

326
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,816
<font color="yellow">You can't make the man stay just because you want him to.</font>

327
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:38,116
<font color="yellow">Kids like him are good for nothing.</font>

328
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,086
<font color="yellow">Please think it over. You must.</font>

329
00:22:44,216 --> 00:22:47,346
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your help. I owe you much for your kindness.</font>

330
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:55,346
<font color="yellow">I almost forgot.</font>

331
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:59,646
<font color="yellow">I get that you're a great doctor...</font>

332
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:02,416
<font color="yellow">and that you're a big shot,</font>

333
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,286
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

334
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:08,086
<font color="yellow">you're the one who thinks you can lecture other people...</font>

335
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:10,846
<font color="yellow">after just doing your job.</font>

336
00:23:15,546 --> 00:23:17,686
<font color="yellow">You're right about me.</font>

337
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:22,016
<font color="yellow">I'm a stupid coward like how you said.</font>

338
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:24,416
<font color="yellow">I studied so hard because I was anxious about having...</font>

339
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:28,346
<font color="yellow">Geodae Hospitals' name to fall back on.</font>

340
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:31,486
<font color="yellow">I did try to flatter in order to climb up the ladder.</font>

341
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:34,616
<font color="yellow">Also, I'm not proud of every decision I've made in my life.</font>

342
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,746
<font color="yellow">But you must know this.</font>

343
00:23:40,216 --> 00:23:42,216
<font color="yellow">Old fossils like you...</font>

344
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:44,846
<font color="yellow">are the ones who made me live like this.</font>

345
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:54,416
<font color="yellow">You shaped this world so that people with no background...</font>

346
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:58,146
<font color="yellow">can't become anything unless they live like me.</font>

347
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:00,546
<font color="yellow">And you look down on us...</font>

348
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:02,646
<font color="yellow">calling us idiots and cowards.</font>

349
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:03,986
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

350
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:06,216
<font color="yellow">You don't even know what it's like to live well.</font>

351
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,686
<font color="yellow">Stop trying to teach me how to live right.</font>

352
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,346
<font color="yellow">You disgust me.</font>

353
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:26,916
<font color="yellow">That'll be all.</font>

354
00:24:29,316 --> 00:24:31,186
<font color="yellow">Where are you going, Dr. Kang?</font>

355
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:38,416
<font color="yellow">Why are you so scared?</font>

356
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,546
<font color="yellow">You haven't done anything wrong.</font>

357
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:43,186
<font color="yellow">What's so great about this hospital to make you be like that?</font>

358
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,616
<font color="yellow">Anywhere is better than here.</font>

359
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,386
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to look for your position as well?</font>

360
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:53,646
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

361
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:56,316
<font color="yellow">Let's calm down and talk this out.</font>

362
00:24:56,316 --> 00:24:57,686
<font color="yellow">Let me know when you change your mind.</font>

363
00:24:58,086 --> 00:24:59,816
<font color="yellow">It's not hard to find open positions.</font>

364
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:04,286
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang. Dr. Kang!</font>

365
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:11,486
<font color="yellow">- What are you going to do? - I'm not sure.</font>

366
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,486
<font color="yellow">What should I do, indeed?</font>

367
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,786
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang, you shouldn't decide things with your emotions.</font>

368
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:23,386
<font color="yellow">I know Master Kim irritates people.</font>

369
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:27,086
<font color="yellow">I know that. He's done it to me, too.</font>

370
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:29,116
<font color="yellow">But still,</font>

371
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:32,086
<font color="yellow">it's not right for you to quit just because of one person.</font>

372
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:35,216
<font color="yellow">It's not just about him. I hate everything about this hospital.</font>

373
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:38,186
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

374
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:40,646
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you don't like about this hospital.</font>

375
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:44,116
<font color="yellow">I can't even tell whether it's a surgery department or an ER.</font>

376
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:45,586
<font color="yellow">The nurses come in and out...</font>

377
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:47,286
<font color="yellow">from the operating room to the emergency room.</font>

378
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,086
<font color="yellow">Nothing is organized here.</font>

379
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,286
<font color="yellow">I don't even know who are responsible for what.</font>

380
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:54,086
<font color="yellow">That's simply because of lacking manpower.</font>

381
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,146
<font color="yellow">There are no departments here.</font>

382
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,516
<font color="yellow">Everyone works together.</font>

383
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,486
<font color="yellow">That's why I want to work at a hospital where...</font>

384
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,386
<font color="yellow">I can put my specialty to good use.</font>

385
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:02,986
<font color="yellow">A big and clean hospital...</font>

386
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:05,816
<font color="yellow">with the latest technology and equipment.</font>

387
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:08,686
<font color="yellow">I admit that our hospital lags a little in some areas...</font>

388
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,616
<font color="yellow">compared to big hospitals in big cities, but...</font>

389
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:11,946
<font color="yellow">That's not a little.</font>

390
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:15,446
<font color="yellow">We're lagging way behind.</font>

391
00:26:16,046 --> 00:26:18,146
<font color="yellow">The building is old.</font>

392
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:19,916
<font color="yellow">The system is out of date.</font>

393
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:22,146
<font color="yellow">Also, the equipment is just awful.</font>

394
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:25,016
<font color="yellow">So stop wasting your time in a place like this...</font>

395
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,546
<font color="yellow">and find a different hospital to work in.</font>

396
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:29,216
<font color="yellow">And then what? Live like you?</font>

397
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:33,116
<font color="yellow">You value the opinions of higher ups more than of the patients.</font>

398
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:36,916
<font color="yellow">All you care about is how to climb the ladder faster.</font>

399
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:41,086
<font color="yellow">It's either that or being stuck in a place like this forever.</font>

400
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:44,586
<font color="yellow">- You're a disgrace. - Dr. Yoon.</font>

401
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:49,316
<font color="yellow">How are those the only things you think about...</font>

402
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:51,816
<font color="yellow">with all your capabilities?</font>

403
00:26:51,816 --> 00:26:55,216
<font color="yellow">Because nothing works out for me even with these capabilities.</font>

404
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:58,286
<font color="yellow">Of course nothing would have worked out with that victim mentality.</font>

405
00:26:58,286 --> 00:26:59,316
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

406
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:01,186
<font color="yellow">Break it up, you two.</font>

407
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:03,746
<font color="yellow">I heard you loud and clear, Dr. Kang.</font>

408
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:07,046
<font color="yellow">I'll discuss with President Yeo and improve the working conditions.</font>

409
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:09,886
<font color="yellow">Do you need a raise? A house to stay in? You name it.</font>

410
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:13,086
<font color="yellow">There's no need for that. He won't even feel grateful.</font>

411
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:15,186
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this, Dr. Yoon?</font>

412
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,686
<font color="yellow">Help me out here, okay?</font>

413
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:18,346
<font color="yellow">I'm really fine, Mr. Jang.</font>

414
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,316
<font color="yellow">Like what she said just now, those things won't change my mind.</font>

415
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:24,486
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Kang. - See? He's like that.</font>

416
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:25,546
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon.</font>

417
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,346
<font color="yellow">I wish you the best of lucks...</font>

418
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:30,016
<font color="yellow">in this rubbish place you call a hospital.</font>

419
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:33,116
<font color="yellow">Mind your own luck. I don't need you to worry about me.</font>

420
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:39,686
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

421
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:42,786
<font color="yellow">- Please, Dr. Kang. - Let go of me.</font>

422
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:45,046
<font color="yellow">- Please. Just this once. - Let me go!</font>

423
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:48,286
<font color="yellow">This hospital is really noisy.</font>

424
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:58,016
<font color="yellow">What are you two on about...</font>

425
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:02,186
<font color="yellow">in this early afternoon?</font>

426
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:11,546
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jo. What a pleasant surprise.</font>

427
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:17,216
<font color="yellow">- Is he your father? - He's Chairman Shin.</font>

428
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:22,186
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you, Chairman Shin.</font>

429
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:25,146
<font color="yellow">I'm Jang Gi Tae of Doldam Hospital.</font>

430
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,386
<font color="yellow">I've been meaning to say hello. Thank you for coming down here.</font>

431
00:28:28,546 --> 00:28:31,786
<font color="yellow">Is there something wrong with Chairman Shin?</font>

432
00:28:32,186 --> 00:28:33,916
<font color="yellow">He's here to see Master Kim.</font>

433
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:36,486
<font color="yellow">What? To see Master Kim?</font>

434
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:40,686
<font color="yellow">These are the candidates for the operation on the chairman.</font>

435
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,686
<font color="yellow">One of them are Dr. John Woo.</font>

436
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:45,846
<font color="yellow">He is a renowned surgeon in the US.</font>

437
00:28:46,786 --> 00:28:49,816
<font color="yellow">This will surely guarantee...</font>

438
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:52,946
<font color="yellow">your third consecutive term. Congratulations in advance.</font>

439
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:55,816
<font color="yellow">Don't get too ahead of yourself.</font>

440
00:28:56,946 --> 00:29:00,216
<font color="yellow">We still have two months left before the board decision.</font>

441
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,516
<font color="yellow">I'm not getting ahead of myself.</font>

442
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:05,486
<font color="yellow">I'm just stating the obvious, President Do.</font>

443
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:08,086
<font color="yellow">Give Ms. Jo a call.</font>

444
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:10,886
<font color="yellow">I'll go down to Jeongseon myself.</font>

445
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,016
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

446
00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:16,586
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

447
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:20,516
<font color="yellow">I thought you said I should come if I wanted to see you.</font>

448
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,646
<font color="yellow">I'm the desperate one here.</font>

449
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:25,716
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see you now.</font>

450
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:28,286
<font color="yellow">If you want me to be your doctor,</font>

451
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:31,686
<font color="yellow">it's like how I already told you.</font>

452
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,316
<font color="yellow">It's been about two years since the operation, right?</font>

453
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,546
<font color="yellow">You're exactly right.</font>

454
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:52,746
<font color="yellow">How does it look?</font>

455
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,586
<font color="yellow">Do you think the operation went well?</font>

456
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:01,916
<font color="yellow">It must have done perfectly since you're alive and well.</font>

457
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:06,416
<font color="yellow">It's been two years now since I've been living with...</font>

458
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:09,946
<font color="yellow">electric wires inside of my body.</font>

459
00:30:10,346 --> 00:30:11,886
<font color="yellow">The way I look at it,</font>

460
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:14,316
<font color="yellow">there's something wrong with...</font>

461
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:17,546
<font color="yellow">the battery inside my body.</font>

462
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:21,746
<font color="yellow">It feels uncomfortable when I'm not even doing anything.</font>

463
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:25,486
<font color="yellow">They told me that I have to live like this...</font>

464
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,816
<font color="yellow">unless I get a heart transplant.</font>

465
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:32,216
<font color="yellow">Who knows when...</font>

466
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:34,946
<font color="yellow">that's going to happen?</font>

467
00:30:35,286 --> 00:30:37,916
<font color="yellow">You've lived so well with all that money.</font>

468
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:41,486
<font color="yellow">Isn't it about time for you to start giving away to other people?</font>

469
00:30:41,546 --> 00:30:44,216
<font color="yellow">Try to do something good for a change.</font>

470
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:47,416
<font color="yellow">Who knows? If you start to live like that,</font>

471
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:52,516
<font color="yellow">the sky may be touched and send you a perfect heart.</font>

472
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:56,086
<font color="yellow">Even if I do find a perfect heart,</font>

473
00:30:57,846 --> 00:30:58,986
<font color="yellow">the problem is this.</font>

474
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:03,686
<font color="yellow">I don't have the perfect doctor.</font>

475
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:06,746
<font color="yellow">What about the one who gave you that artificial heart?</font>

476
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:08,046
<font color="yellow">He died.</font>

477
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:09,616
<font color="yellow">He died with a heart attack.</font>

478
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:13,416
<font color="yellow">He was in a heart surgery to save someone else's life,</font>

479
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:15,746
<font color="yellow">but he got a heart attack and died.</font>

480
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:17,816
<font color="yellow">Funny, isn't it?</font>

481
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:19,816
<font color="yellow">It's sad.</font>

482
00:31:24,286 --> 00:31:25,416
<font color="yellow">Will you do it?</font>

483
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:29,716
<font color="yellow">I heard you used to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.</font>

484
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,346
<font color="yellow">Why me?</font>

485
00:31:32,946 --> 00:31:35,886
<font color="yellow">There are many other qualified doctors.</font>

486
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:40,116
<font color="yellow">I know that there are millions of qualified doctors.</font>

487
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:41,816
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

488
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:44,216
<font color="yellow">not many of them are real.</font>

489
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,816
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm real?</font>

490
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:53,586
<font color="yellow">How do you think...</font>

491
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,716
<font color="yellow">I made this much money?</font>

492
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:02,686
<font color="yellow">It's all because I have an eye for people.</font>

493
00:32:05,186 --> 00:32:06,816
<font color="yellow">I can see...</font>

494
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:08,746
<font color="yellow">who is real.</font>

495
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:11,986
<font color="yellow">In that case,</font>

496
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:15,686
<font color="yellow">your eye for people probably grew old.</font>

497
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,216
<font color="yellow">Why? Don't you want to perform...</font>

498
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,216
<font color="yellow">my surgery?</font>

499
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:21,946
<font color="yellow">Is it because I'm trashy?</font>

500
00:32:36,446 --> 00:32:38,346
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry to interrupt.</font>

501
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:40,886
<font color="yellow">Please let me introduce some of our tea menu...</font>

502
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:43,546
<font color="yellow">prepared just for our VIP patients.</font>

503
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:46,416
<font color="yellow">We have Earl Grey tea, English Breakfast, and Ceylon tea.</font>

504
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:49,646
<font color="yellow">We also have three different types of green tea.</font>

505
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:51,646
<font color="yellow">You can have them in both hot or iced,</font>

506
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:53,746
<font color="yellow">or as a milk tea if you wish.</font>

507
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:55,346
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

508
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:13,746
<font color="yellow">Have you ever...</font>

509
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,116
<font color="yellow">thought about me?</font>

510
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:22,446
<font color="yellow">Have you ever missed me?</font>

511
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:30,146
<font color="yellow">Can't you hear me?</font>

512
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:31,786
<font color="yellow">What's with you?</font>

513
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:34,816
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

514
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:37,186
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

515
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:40,146
<font color="yellow">Did you say something to me?</font>

516
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:41,916
<font color="yellow">Have you ever missed me?</font>

517
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,286
<font color="yellow">For the last five years,</font>

518
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:55,056
<font color="yellow">have you ever thought of me?</font>

519
00:35:07,716 --> 00:35:10,446
<font color="yellow">I got lost in the mountains.</font>

520
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,616
<font color="yellow">I slipped on a slope and hurt my wrist.</font>

521
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:17,886
<font color="yellow">My focus was only rehabilitation for the next three years.</font>

522
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:21,846
<font color="yellow">Thankfully, 90 percent of my wrist is back to normal.</font>

523
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:23,556
<font color="yellow">That's how I got on the emergency medicine board.</font>

524
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:29,916
<font color="yellow">After that, I wanted to be certified as a cardiothoracic surgeon.</font>

525
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:33,146
<font color="yellow">Most of the patients in the emergency room have...</font>

526
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,686
<font color="yellow">heart or lung problems.</font>

527
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:38,346
<font color="yellow">That sounds like you did not have any time to think of me.</font>

528
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:42,646
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

529
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,446
<font color="yellow">Okay. I get it.</font>

530
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:56,986
<font color="yellow">I heard you.</font>

531
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:06,016
<font color="yellow">I missed you, too.</font>

532
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:11,416
<font color="yellow">I don't know why,</font>

533
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:14,786
<font color="yellow">but I thought of you from time to time.</font>

534
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:20,416
<font color="yellow">Are you saying this because I'm leaving?</font>

535
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:23,616
<font color="yellow">Are you pitying me?</font>

536
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,786
<font color="yellow">Did it sound like that?</font>

537
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:35,216
<font color="yellow">If so, I can't help it.</font>

538
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:42,816
<font color="yellow">(Master Kim)</font>

539
00:36:43,716 --> 00:36:44,786
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

540
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,016
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

541
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:01,716
<font color="yellow">Succeeding and advancing in your career.</font>

542
00:37:03,216 --> 00:37:04,446
<font color="yellow">They're all great.</font>

543
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,186
<font color="yellow">But hey, Dong Joo.</font>

544
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,056
<font color="yellow">We're doctors.</font>

545
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:12,916
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

546
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:15,586
<font color="yellow">We're doctors, so what?</font>

547
00:37:17,116 --> 00:37:18,586
<font color="yellow">We're only doctors,</font>

548
00:37:20,016 --> 00:37:21,316
<font color="yellow">but we're still doctors.</font>

549
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:26,186
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that.</font>

550
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:21,986
<font color="yellow">Are you off duty?</font>

551
00:38:22,786 --> 00:38:24,886
<font color="yellow">No. I am leaving.</font>

552
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:28,946
<font color="yellow">Did you say goodbye to President Yeo?</font>

553
00:38:29,616 --> 00:38:31,646
<font color="yellow">I turned in my resignation. That's enough.</font>

554
00:38:34,216 --> 00:38:35,286
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry,</font>

555
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:40,216
<font color="yellow">but we have a hand laceration case in the emergency room.</font>

556
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:44,216
<font color="yellow">I know you're leaving, but can you stitch it up?</font>

557
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:50,086
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

558
00:38:56,746 --> 00:38:57,946
<font color="yellow">Where's the patient?</font>

559
00:38:58,346 --> 00:39:00,516
<font color="yellow">The patient is waiting in the hybrid operating room.</font>

560
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:17,716
<font color="yellow">I'm ready to hear.</font>

561
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:23,316
<font color="yellow">I will comply with whatever decision you made.</font>

562
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:24,986
<font color="yellow">I mean,</font>

563
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,186
<font color="yellow">I will comply...</font>

564
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,516
<font color="yellow">with anything but getting fired.</font>

565
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:41,816
<font color="yellow">Come closer.</font>

566
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,816
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - Let me see your hand.</font>

567
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,056
<font color="yellow">Come closer.</font>

568
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:49,746
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

569
00:40:20,446 --> 00:40:21,556
<font color="yellow">Are you doing okay?</font>

570
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:24,216
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

571
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:38,146
<font color="yellow">You're good.</font>

572
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:40,446
<font color="yellow">You would have made a great plastic surgeon.</font>

573
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:42,946
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that because I'm slow?</font>

574
00:40:43,186 --> 00:40:45,146
<font color="yellow">I'm complimenting you for your precision.</font>

575
00:40:49,286 --> 00:40:51,556
<font color="yellow">What do you hate so much about Doldam Hospital?</font>

576
00:40:56,846 --> 00:40:57,886
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

577
00:40:57,886 --> 00:41:00,486
<font color="yellow">I asked you to tell me three reasons...</font>

578
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:03,446
<font color="yellow">why you want to stay in this hospital so much.</font>

579
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:07,286
<font color="yellow">First of all, I don't like Master Kim.</font>

580
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:09,646
<font color="yellow">I want to learn from you.</font>

581
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:11,746
<font color="yellow">Second, I don't like this hospital.</font>

582
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:13,986
<font color="yellow">I want to learn from you.</font>

583
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:17,216
<font color="yellow">I can't see my future in this hospital.</font>

584
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:18,346
<font color="yellow">I want to learn...</font>

585
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:22,586
<font color="yellow">from you.</font>

586
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:27,846
<font color="yellow">I want to carry out a collaborative surgery with you some day.</font>

587
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:30,846
<font color="yellow">It is my wish.</font>

588
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:35,146
<font color="yellow">I want to become the best doctor, not a good doctor.</font>

589
00:41:35,846 --> 00:41:37,016
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

590
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:39,686
<font color="yellow">this isn't where I belong.</font>

591
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:40,946
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

592
00:41:43,016 --> 00:41:44,216
<font color="yellow">Then, let me ask you one more thing.</font>

593
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:45,946
<font color="yellow">From your perspective,</font>

594
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:51,056
<font color="yellow">is Master Kim a good doctor or the best doctor?</font>

595
00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:11,946
<font color="yellow">Which one is he?</font>

596
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:14,186
<font color="yellow">Is Master Kim...</font>

597
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:16,586
<font color="yellow">a good doctor...</font>

598
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:18,846
<font color="yellow">or the best doctor?</font>

599
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:21,556
<font color="yellow">These are the best doctors.</font>

600
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:22,946
<font color="yellow">Please take a look.</font>

601
00:42:23,516 --> 00:42:25,556
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad.</font>

602
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:28,586
<font color="yellow">You came all the way here for nothing.</font>

603
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:30,646
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

604
00:42:32,446 --> 00:42:33,486
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

605
00:42:34,746 --> 00:42:38,746
<font color="yellow">I've already found a doctor to operate on me.</font>

606
00:42:40,386 --> 00:42:42,556
<font color="yellow">He's a talented doctor.</font>

607
00:42:42,556 --> 00:42:45,646
<font color="yellow">May I ask who recommended you the doctor?</font>

608
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,086
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin, it's a call from Master Kim.</font>

609
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:49,286
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll take it.</font>

610
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:53,586
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim. It's me.</font>

611
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:55,916
<font color="yellow">Have you made up your mind?</font>

612
00:42:56,916 --> 00:43:00,486
<font color="yellow">First, I need a new ultrasound machine. The latest model.</font>

613
00:43:00,486 --> 00:43:04,646
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me for that instead of the surgery fee?</font>

614
00:43:04,746 --> 00:43:05,916
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

615
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,056
<font color="yellow">This would be the settlement money.</font>

616
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:11,316
<font color="yellow">As a result of being beaten up yesterday,</font>

617
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:15,686
<font color="yellow">I have injuries requiring 2 or 3 weeks of medial treatment.</font>

618
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:20,816
<font color="yellow">As I've already told you, I'm worth a lot of money.</font>

619
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:24,946
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll buy you the latest equipment.</font>

620
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:29,086
<font color="yellow">Then, will you take up my operation?</font>

621
00:43:29,216 --> 00:43:31,486
<font color="yellow">In order to change the battery of your artificial heart,</font>

622
00:43:31,686 --> 00:43:34,216
<font color="yellow">we need a new ultrasound machine to begin with.</font>

623
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:37,056
<font color="yellow">We also need the latest model of operation table, anesthesia machine,</font>

624
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:39,416
<font color="yellow">and a heart-lung machine.</font>

625
00:43:40,316 --> 00:43:43,916
<font color="yellow">If you consider a heart transplant in the future.</font>

626
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:45,086
<font color="yellow">I'm listening.</font>

627
00:43:45,786 --> 00:43:49,886
<font color="yellow">We'll also need a clean room for the immunosuppression therapy,</font>

628
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:52,446
<font color="yellow">but... Gosh. How can I say?</font>

629
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:54,916
<font color="yellow">These are very expensive equipments. I'm worried.</font>

630
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:58,186
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't mind how much it'd cost. Don't worry about it.</font>

631
00:43:58,716 --> 00:44:00,646
<font color="yellow">No matter how much it'll cost me,</font>

632
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:03,446
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you the latest equipments.</font>

633
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:08,146
<font color="yellow">If I do that, will you operate on me?</font>

634
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:12,116
<font color="yellow">Once we get the equipment, I'll set the date for your surgery.</font>

635
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,646
<font color="yellow">You heard that, right? Master Kim said...</font>

636
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:22,186
<font color="yellow">he'll operate on me.</font>

637
00:44:22,216 --> 00:44:23,486
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

638
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:24,986
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin.</font>

639
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:27,416
<font color="yellow">Have I done...</font>

640
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:30,686
<font color="yellow">anything to upset you?</font>

641
00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:32,386
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

642
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:37,086
<font color="yellow">You've been doing a great job in running Geodae Hospital.</font>

643
00:44:37,086 --> 00:44:39,716
<font color="yellow">Then, why did you refuse all the doctors I recommended you...</font>

644
00:44:40,116 --> 00:44:42,916
<font color="yellow">and let an unknown doctor operate on you?</font>

645
00:44:45,186 --> 00:44:47,316
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to know? - If I may,</font>

646
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,786
<font color="yellow">I'd like to hear the reason.</font>

647
00:44:53,716 --> 00:44:56,416
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jo, show it to him.</font>

648
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:57,486
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

649
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:09,616
<font color="yellow">- What do you see? - It looks like the scene of a fire.</font>

650
00:45:10,186 --> 00:45:11,486
<font color="yellow">Is this the kitchen in the casino?</font>

651
00:45:11,586 --> 00:45:15,046
<font color="yellow">The fire broke out last night.</font>

652
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:18,716
<font color="yellow">What do you see?</font>

653
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:21,186
<font color="yellow">It seems that the staff members in the kitchen got severely injured.</font>

654
00:45:21,216 --> 00:45:23,886
<font color="yellow">Right. What else?</font>

655
00:45:25,116 --> 00:45:26,616
<font color="yellow">This man...</font>

656
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:28,986
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

657
00:45:30,086 --> 00:45:31,286
<font color="yellow">That's him.</font>

658
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:33,946
<font color="yellow">He jumped into the fire...</font>

659
00:45:34,216 --> 00:45:36,846
<font color="yellow">to save other people's lives.</font>

660
00:45:38,086 --> 00:45:39,616
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'm following you.</font>

661
00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:42,446
<font color="yellow">Usually, when people get hurt,</font>

662
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:46,146
<font color="yellow">doctors only care about the treatment of their wounds.</font>

663
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:51,216
<font color="yellow">But he tried to help them get injured less.</font>

664
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,986
<font color="yellow">He might have lost his own life,</font>

665
00:45:53,986 --> 00:45:56,346
<font color="yellow">but he still jumped into the fire.</font>

666
00:45:56,846 --> 00:45:58,946
<font color="yellow">Do you still not understand...</font>

667
00:46:00,146 --> 00:46:02,086
<font color="yellow">the difference?</font>

668
00:46:03,546 --> 00:46:05,486
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think I do.</font>

669
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:10,016
<font color="yellow">This man is the doctor who's called Master Kim.</font>

670
00:46:10,946 --> 00:46:13,216
<font color="yellow">He's the true doctor whom I can trust...</font>

671
00:46:14,346 --> 00:46:15,786
<font color="yellow">with my life.</font>

672
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:42,846
<font color="yellow">It looks like you finally recognized his face.</font>

673
00:46:46,686 --> 00:46:49,516
<font color="yellow">You're right. That's him.</font>

674
00:46:54,216 --> 00:46:56,946
<font color="yellow">He's in ventricular fibrillation. Sir. Sir.</font>

675
00:47:00,586 --> 00:47:03,686
<font color="yellow">Move him to the hybrid operating room and bring the defibrillator.</font>

676
00:47:04,886 --> 00:47:07,416
<font color="yellow">- Give him epinephrine. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

677
00:47:15,286 --> 00:47:17,086
<font color="yellow">Did you meet Master Kim?</font>

678
00:47:19,116 --> 00:47:20,146
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung.</font>

679
00:47:23,586 --> 00:47:24,616
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

680
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:28,686
<font color="yellow">What did he say? Did he say you can stay here?</font>

681
00:47:31,446 --> 00:47:32,546
<font color="yellow">Actually...</font>

682
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:36,916
<font color="yellow">You can stay here if you want to.</font>

683
00:47:39,186 --> 00:47:40,586
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

684
00:47:43,386 --> 00:47:45,516
<font color="yellow">I won't forget that you gave me the second chance,</font>

685
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:49,746
<font color="yellow">and I'll do everything in my power to repay your generosity.</font>

686
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:53,346
<font color="yellow">However, I can't allow you...</font>

687
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:55,646
<font color="yellow">to treat patients yet.</font>

688
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:59,516
<font color="yellow">If I don't treat patients,</font>

689
00:48:00,816 --> 00:48:02,086
<font color="yellow">what should I do here?</font>

690
00:48:04,386 --> 00:48:05,486
<font color="yellow">You'll work as an orderly.</font>

691
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,416
<font color="yellow">- Orderly? - Yes, I'm an orderly.</font>

692
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,746
<font color="yellow">Did you just tell me to work...</font>

693
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:15,416
<font color="yellow">as an orderly?</font>

694
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:18,986
<font color="yellow">I need to be sure if I can let you be with the patients or not.</font>

695
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:21,516
<font color="yellow">Until you become able to control yourself solely...</font>

696
00:48:21,886 --> 00:48:24,086
<font color="yellow">with your willpower without taking medications,</font>

697
00:48:24,746 --> 00:48:26,586
<font color="yellow">the only job you can get in this hospital is...</font>

698
00:48:27,216 --> 00:48:28,746
<font color="yellow">to be an orderly.</font>

699
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,346
<font color="yellow">Why? Can't you do that?</font>

700
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:37,746
<font color="yellow">No. It's not that.</font>

701
00:48:38,146 --> 00:48:39,286
<font color="yellow">Did you accept it?</font>

702
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,186
<font color="yellow">I asked him for some time to think about it.</font>

703
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:43,846
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that?</font>

704
00:48:44,016 --> 00:48:45,886
<font color="yellow">You should have refused it.</font>

705
00:48:45,986 --> 00:48:46,986
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

706
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:51,186
<font color="yellow">- Working as an orderly is... - Really? Can't you do that?</font>

707
00:48:56,816 --> 00:49:00,046
<font color="yellow">You can just leave this hospital if you can't do it.</font>

708
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:03,616
<font color="yellow">- I won't stop you. - I didn't say I can't do it.</font>

709
00:49:03,616 --> 00:49:05,646
<font color="yellow">You can't make her work as an orderly.</font>

710
00:49:05,646 --> 00:49:09,586
<font color="yellow">This is the best offer I can give to her, Ms. Oh.</font>

711
00:49:09,986 --> 00:49:11,186
<font color="yellow">Don't try to change my mind.</font>

712
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,286
<font color="yellow">You heard him. I should go now.</font>

713
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:28,216
<font color="yellow">Charge 200J.</font>

714
00:49:29,616 --> 00:49:30,686
<font color="yellow">It's ready.</font>

715
00:49:32,546 --> 00:49:33,616
<font color="yellow">Shock.</font>

716
00:49:41,686 --> 00:49:43,586
<font color="yellow">- Fill me in. - He's from a car accident.</font>

717
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:46,516
<font color="yellow">He has right-sided hemopneumothorax and his right hip is dislocated.</font>

718
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:50,146
<font color="yellow">He went into ventricular fibrillation while being hydrated.</font>

719
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:51,816
<font color="yellow">Please hang in there.</font>

720
00:49:53,146 --> 00:49:54,286
<font color="yellow">I'll check his heart rhythm.</font>

721
00:49:56,386 --> 00:49:58,646
<font color="yellow">- Let's try it again. 200J. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

722
00:50:00,846 --> 00:50:01,886
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

723
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:05,316
<font color="yellow">Shock.</font>

724
00:50:09,086 --> 00:50:11,946
<font color="yellow">- How long has it been? - It's been about three minutes.</font>

725
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:16,946
<font color="yellow">Please, please.</font>

726
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:20,646
<font color="yellow">I'll check his heart rhythm.</font>

727
00:50:23,216 --> 00:50:24,646
<font color="yellow">Doctor, his pulse is back.</font>

728
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:31,546
<font color="yellow">Print out the electrocardiogram and prepare the central line.</font>

729
00:50:31,546 --> 00:50:33,546
<font color="yellow">- As for the blood transfusion... - You said you'd quit.</font>

730
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,416
<font color="yellow">Why are you still here?</font>

731
00:50:37,616 --> 00:50:41,646
<font color="yellow">I'm considering him as my last patient in Doldam Hospital.</font>

732
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:44,046
<font color="yellow">Did you get his CT scan result?</font>

733
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:46,846
<font color="yellow">He has multiple rib fracture and right-sided hemopneumothorax.</font>

734
00:50:47,186 --> 00:50:49,446
<font color="yellow">I put in a tube and he's not bleeding much.</font>

735
00:50:49,886 --> 00:50:51,886
<font color="yellow">Simple dislocation on the right hip...</font>

736
00:50:52,146 --> 00:50:54,716
<font color="yellow">and compound fracture on the left humerus was also found.</font>

737
00:50:54,816 --> 00:50:56,846
<font color="yellow">Have you ever dealt with hip dislocation before?</font>

738
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:57,886
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

739
00:50:58,046 --> 00:51:00,746
<font color="yellow">I know how to do it, though. Do you want me to do it?</font>

740
00:51:00,746 --> 00:51:01,746
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park.</font>

741
00:51:02,316 --> 00:51:03,486
<font color="yellow">Bring me a sheet.</font>

742
00:51:12,146 --> 00:51:13,286
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

743
00:51:13,746 --> 00:51:15,086
<font color="yellow">Tie up the other side.</font>

744
00:51:26,746 --> 00:51:27,746
<font color="yellow">Are you doing it alone?</font>

745
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:35,446
<font color="yellow">Is it done?</font>

746
00:51:42,216 --> 00:51:43,216
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

747
00:51:43,786 --> 00:51:45,346
<font color="yellow">What about his vital signs?</font>

748
00:51:45,386 --> 00:51:47,046
<font color="yellow">- It is stable. - Okay.</font>

749
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:50,016
<font color="yellow">Next up is the humerus.</font>

750
00:51:56,386 --> 00:51:57,446
<font color="yellow">Which one are you?</font>

751
00:51:58,046 --> 00:51:59,116
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

752
00:51:59,846 --> 00:52:01,586
<font color="yellow">Are you a good doctor...</font>

753
00:52:02,046 --> 00:52:03,386
<font color="yellow">or the best doctor?</font>

754
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:33,586
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

755
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:43,746
<font color="yellow">(Kang Dong Joo)</font>

756
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:52,816
<font color="yellow">I only want to hear it from you.</font>

757
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:57,016
<font color="yellow">Are you a good doctor or the best doctor?</font>

758
00:53:06,586 --> 00:53:09,046
<font color="yellow">If the patient lying down here gets to choose one of them,</font>

759
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,216
<font color="yellow">which one do you think he will choose?</font>

760
00:53:13,286 --> 00:53:14,816
<font color="yellow">- The best doctor. - Wrong.</font>

761
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:18,146
<font color="yellow">He will need a doctor who can treat his injury.</font>

762
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:24,116
<font color="yellow">What this patient would need so badly...</font>

763
00:53:24,486 --> 00:53:26,386
<font color="yellow">is an orthopedic surgeon who can treat fractures.</font>

764
00:53:27,046 --> 00:53:29,786
<font color="yellow">So I'm playing all my cards...</font>

765
00:53:30,886 --> 00:53:33,786
<font color="yellow">to be the right one for him.</font>

766
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:35,716
<font color="yellow">Does this answer your question?</font>

767
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:41,016
<font color="yellow">You can blame the system and the world.</font>

768
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:44,746
<font color="yellow">You can blame all the people who messed up the world if you want.</font>

769
00:53:44,986 --> 00:53:45,986
<font color="yellow">I know you can.</font>

770
00:53:46,716 --> 00:53:49,886
<font color="yellow">But nothing will change even if you try so hard to blame everything.</font>

771
00:53:52,616 --> 00:53:54,116
<font color="yellow">Those people won't even...</font>

772
00:53:54,946 --> 00:53:57,316
<font color="yellow">remember your name.</font>

773
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:06,216
<font color="yellow">If you really want to win, become a doctor who can serve.</font>

774
00:54:06,846 --> 00:54:08,786
<font color="yellow">Stop blaming them and pay them back with your capability.</font>

775
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:16,146
<font color="yellow">As long as you don't change,</font>

776
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,346
<font color="yellow">nothing will change.</font>

777
00:54:19,346 --> 00:54:20,346
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

778
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:24,286
<font color="yellow">As long as you don't change,</font>

779

<font color="yellow">nothing will change.</font>

780

<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

781
00:54:32,316 --> 00:54:33,316
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

782
00:54:34,216 --> 00:54:36,346
<font color="yellow">I will let you finish up on the last patient...</font>

783

<font color="yellow">at Doldam Hospital.</font>

784

<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

785
00:54:53,346 --> 00:54:54,416
<font color="yellow">Is that him?</font>

786
00:54:57,116 --> 00:54:58,146
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

787
00:54:59,646 --> 00:55:02,046

791
00:55:26,186 --> 00:55:27,216
<font color="yellow">You are him, right?</font>

792
00:55:28,816 --> 00:55:29,946
<font color="yellow">You are the doctor.</font>

793

<font color="yellow">Aren't you?</font>

794
00:55:37,686 --> 00:55:38,886
<font color="yellow">You are Dr. Boo Yong Joo.</font>

795
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:47,346
<font color="yellow">Is that him?</font>

796
00:55:48,716 --> 00:55:51,116
