471

<font color="yellow">to take Chairman Shin out of the hospital. Now!</font>

472
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,640
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will take care of it.</font>

473
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,570

474
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,700

<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

477
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,740
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to go this far.</font>

478
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,640
<font color="yellow">Attack!</font>

479
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,770

480
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,740

493

<font color="yellow">He's awake.</font>

494
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,740
<font color="yellow">Exactly. Since he's awake, we should...</font>

495
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,100

497
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,470

498
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,770
<font color="yellow">and get lost from this hospital. Okay?</font>

499
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,810

500
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,840

502
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

503
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,840
<font color="yellow">No, I'm on my way right now.</font>

504
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,070
<font color="yellow">Father is awake.</font>

505
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,140
<font color="yellow">He recognizes everyone and is very conscious.</font>

506
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,400
<font color="yellow">How's my father?</font>

507
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,700
<font color="yellow">You should go in there.</font>

508
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,100
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin.</font>

509
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,900
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling right now?</font>

510
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,700
<font color="yellow">Did the surgery go well?</font>

511
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,040
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

512
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,840
<font color="yellow">It was a success, Chairman Shin.</font>

513
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,200
<font color="yellow">Good work,</font>

514
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,170
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

515
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,640
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

516
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,900
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

517
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,370
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right? - Yes.</font>

518
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,040
<font color="yellow">- I'm all right. - Dad.</font>

519
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,670
<font color="yellow">Do you have any idea how worried I was?</font>

520
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,870
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Dad.</font>

521
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,100
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

522
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,970
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

523
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,140
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

524
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

525
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,340
<font color="yellow">That cocky swine.</font>

526
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,310
<font color="yellow">President Do. What do you intend to do now?</font>

527
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,270
<font color="yellow">The chairman is awake and...</font>

528
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,670
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, the dispatched staff will return by tomorrow.</font>

529
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,470
<font color="yellow">- I will also go back to Seoul... - No.</font>

530
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,170
<font color="yellow">- Stay here for a little longer. - Pardon?</font>

531
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,400
<font color="yellow">My game isn't over yet.</font>

532
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,400
<font color="yellow">So until Doldam Hospital closes down,</font>

533
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,810
<font color="yellow">be prepared to completely devote yourself to this hospital.</font>

534
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,170
<font color="yellow">Devote myself?</font>

535
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,900
<font color="yellow">I said I'm sorry, Honey.</font>

536
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,340
<font color="yellow">They said I was going back to Geodae Hospital tomorrow.</font>

537
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,700
<font color="yellow">I even packed all my things.</font>

538
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,870
<font color="yellow">Now they're saying the decision has been changed.</font>

539
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not happy about this either.</font>

540
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,640
<font color="yellow">Do you think I want to... Hello?</font>

541
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,470
<font color="yellow">Who am I talking to?</font>

542
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

543
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,540
<font color="yellow">Your wife must be really upset.</font>

544
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,170
<font color="yellow">It's either one of the two.</font>

545
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,310
<font color="yellow">Either I hand in my resignation or I get divorced.</font>

546
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,440
<font color="yellow">Why don't your wife and your baby come down here and live with you?</font>

547
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,310
<font color="yellow">My daughter just started walking...</font>

548
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,470
<font color="yellow">and she's the kind of woman who is already looking into pre-schools.</font>

549
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,570
<font color="yellow">I see. I guess she won't come.</font>

552

<font color="yellow">I'll buy you a glass of beer.</font>

553
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,310
<font color="yellow">- I'm in. - I'm in.</font>

554
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,240
<font color="yellow">Do they have good food there?</font>

555
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,370
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam's ramyeon is delicious.</font>

556
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,840
<font color="yellow">Their signature dish is ramyeon?</font>

557
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,570
<font color="yellow">There's beer, too.</font>

558
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,370

559
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,740
<font color="yellow">That patient with glass penetrated through the abdomen...</font>

560
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,740
<font color="yellow">The CT scan result came out. Do you want to go look at it?</font>

561

<font color="yellow">It's not a common case.</font>

562

563

566
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,140
<font color="yellow">Everyone here is suffering...</font>

567
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,740

568

569
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,740

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,170
<font color="yellow">I'm really thankful.</font>

620
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,170
<font color="yellow">I mean it.</font>

<font color="yellow">Please go ahead.</font>

635
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:20,470

<font color="yellow">Dr. Kim Somebody! Are you busy now?</font>

642
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,140
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

643
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,470
<font color="yellow">When you use the Billroth two for a gastrectomy,</font>

644
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,070
<font color="yellow">should you leave the front part as a cul-de-sac?</font>

649
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,870
<font color="yellow">It's about the Roux-en-Y bypass.</font>

650
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,840
<font color="yellow">If you connect the stomach and the jejunum,</font>

651
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,900
<font color="yellow">you leave the duodenum as it is, right?</font>

652
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,940
<font color="yellow">It contains videos of the operations you asked me about.</font>

653
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,100
<font color="yellow">Both gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y bypass.</font>

654
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,870
<font color="yellow">Did you perform those operations?</font>

655
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,100
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask so many questions?</font>

656
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,370
<font color="yellow">Just watch the videos.</font>

657
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,970
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You are so talkative.</font>

658

00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,940
<font color="yellow">He has glass shatter in the wound,</font>

773
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,300
<font color="yellow">but he isn't bleeding much.</font>

774
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,300
<font color="yellow">I think the patient with an aortic dissection is more urgent.</font>

775
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,970
<font color="yellow">Do we have someone with an aortic dissection?</font>

776
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,240
<font color="yellow">- Do you have his CT scan? - It just came out.</font>

777
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,040
<font color="yellow">It's type A and it has already ascended.</font>

778
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:11,040
<font color="yellow">- What's his blood pressure? - Initially, 160 over 100...</font>

779
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,470
<font color="yellow">on the right and 100 over 60 on the left.</font>

780
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,700
<font color="yellow">After we injected esmolol,</font>

781
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,740
<font color="yellow">his BP on the right side dropped to 120 over 80.</font>

782
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,640
<font color="yellow">- What about his EKG? - We took a look.</font>

783
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,440
<font color="yellow">- How's aortic valve regurgitation? - A bit, but not much.</font>

784
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,440
<font color="yellow">- What about the other patient? - His CT scan is coming up.</font>

785
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,070
<font color="yellow">- It's ischemic colitis. - Ischemic colitis?</font>

786
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,770
<font color="yellow">We have the CT scan of the ischemic colitis patient.</font>

787
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,800
<font color="yellow">This is bad.</font>

788
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,100
<font color="yellow">I even see pneumatosis intestinalis.</font>

789
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,270
<font color="yellow">We have to cut it out.</font>

790
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,470
<font color="yellow">Yes. It seems so.</font>

791
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,570
<font color="yellow">All three of them are emergency cases. What should we do?</font>

792
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,670
<font color="yellow">It's not like we can...</font>

793
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,200
<font color="yellow">send any one of them to another hospital.</font>

794
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,600
<font color="yellow">Master Kim, let's start with the aortic dissection case.</font>

795
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,640
<font color="yellow">It'll take us a while to prepare fully for the operation.</font>

796
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,040
<font color="yellow">I believe we should begin with the ischemic colitis patient.</font>

797
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,300
<font color="yellow">The aortic dissection patient is the most urgent case.</font>

798
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,470
<font color="yellow">That patient came in first, too.</font>

799
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,340
<font color="yellow">If we have to go by the order which they came in,</font>

800
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,140
<font color="yellow">we have to go with the abdomen penetration.</font>

801
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,570
<font color="yellow">The most urgent case is...</font>

802
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,700
<font color="yellow">the aortic dissection patient. Isn't that right?</font>

803
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:21,340
<font color="yellow">Why are you so hung up over that case? You're a GS.</font>

804
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,870
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

805
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,840
<font color="yellow">Let me know if you need anything else.</font>

806
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,000
