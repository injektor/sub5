158
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,950
<font color="yellow">Make sure you do this as if you're making your own tree.</font>

159
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,150
<font color="yellow">Is it Christmas already?</font>

160
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,250
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

161
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,350
<font color="yellow">I became in charge of Chairman Shin as a cardiac surgeon...</font>

162
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,790
<font color="yellow">and not as an emergency medical personnel.</font>

163
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,520
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Dr. Yoon.</font>

164
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,490
<font color="yellow">I guess reading those books on artificial hearts paid off.</font>

165
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,290
<font color="yellow">- Did you notice?
- Of course, I did.</font>

166
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,120
<font color="yellow">- It's so awesome.
- Congratulations.</font>

167
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,250
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

168
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,150
<font color="yellow">You will still visit the emergency room, right?</font>

169
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,090
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, still? I will be around.</font>

170
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,120
<font color="yellow">This calls for a celebration.</font>

171
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,150
<font color="yellow">- Buy us food!
- Buy us food!</font>

172
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,620
<font color="yellow">- Buy us food!
- All right!</font>

173
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Kang Dong Joo.</font>

174
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,190
<font color="yellow">Come to my room.</font>

175
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

177
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,450
<font color="yellow">We tried to put everything together for you, Chairman Shin.</font>

178
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,350
<font color="yellow">If you need anything else, please do let me know.</font>

179
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,090
<font color="yellow">I am Jang Gi Tae, the manager of Doldam Hospital.</font>

180
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,290
<font color="yellow">This is enough. Thank you for your kindness.</font>

181
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,590
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

182
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,920
<font color="yellow">Who's this?</font>

183
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,020
<font color="yellow">- Are you my doctor?
- I'm...</font>

184
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,550
<font color="yellow">Song Hyun Cheol, the chief surgeon of Geodae Hospital. We met before.</font>

185
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,820
<font color="yellow">And this is Dr. Do In Beom.</font>

186
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,820
<font color="yellow">He's President Do's son.</font>

187
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,390
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Chairman Shin.
- Is this young man...</font>

188
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,690
<font color="yellow">- my doctor?
- No, that's not the case.</font>

189
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,550
<font color="yellow">We just came by to say hello to you, Chairman Shin.</font>

190
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,720
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

191
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,220
<font color="yellow">Where is my doctor?</font>

192
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,220
<font color="yellow">What happened, Manager Jang?</font>

193
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,420
<font color="yellow">Why isn't his doctor here?</font>

194
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,120
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

195
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,590
<font color="yellow">Hello, Chairman Shin. I am Yoon Seo Jung.</font>

196
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,490
<font color="yellow">I am your doctor.</font>

197
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,220
<font color="yellow">Are you a woman?</font>

198
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,650
<font color="yellow">Don't you have...</font>

199
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,250
<font color="yellow">any male doctors?</font>

200
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,190
<font color="yellow">- Chairman Shin.
- Where's Master Kim?</font>

201
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,520
<font color="yellow">Tell him to come immediately. How dare he do this?</font>

202
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,290
<font color="yellow">He must know that I'm here. How can he not show himself?</font>

203
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,990
<font color="yellow">- Call him immediately!
- Okay.</font>

204
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,950
<font color="yellow">Put some time aside tonight.</font>

205
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,620
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

206
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,620
<font color="yellow">I have to hold a video conference...</font>

207
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,490
<font color="yellow">with some doctors in Cleveland...</font>

208
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,750
<font color="yellow">regarding artificial hearts.</font>

209
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,390
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of materials to cover.</font>

210
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,450
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

211
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,390
<font color="yellow">Master Kim. You have to see Chairman Shin immediately.</font>

212
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,490
<font color="yellow">There is a problem.</font>

213
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,590
<font color="yellow">Hey. Why are you here?</font>

214
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,520
<font color="yellow">He's the chairman of board. Of course I have to be here.</font>

215
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,390
<font color="yellow">I'll give him my regards...</font>

216
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,190
<font color="yellow">and introduce myself to him.</font>

217
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,550
<font color="yellow">I'm worried Dr. Yoon might not handle the operation very well.</font>

218
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,920
<font color="yellow">Perhaps you should consider replacing her.</font>

219
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,320
<font color="yellow">What are you standing there for?</font>

220
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,850
<font color="yellow">I said get out.</font>

221
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,920
<font color="yellow">I'll give you an explanation of the tests you'll undergo.</font>

222
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,790
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon...</font>

223
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,490
<font color="yellow">You will go under a blood test and an X-Ray scan today.</font>

224
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,550
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear what I said?</font>

225
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,650
<font color="yellow">You will have to go on a fast starting this evening...</font>

226
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,790
<font color="yellow">and we'll do a CT scan on you tomorrow morning.</font>

227
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,490
<font color="yellow">I said I only talk to Master Kim.</font>

228
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,520
<font color="yellow">Bring him here.</font>

229
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,150
<font color="yellow">Master Kim...</font>

230
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,590
<font color="yellow">has many things to do for preparing the operation.</font>

231
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,650
<font color="yellow">Simple tests like these can be done under my supervision.</font>

232
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,690
<font color="yellow">Like I said,</font>

233
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,250
<font color="yellow">I don't feel comfortable...</font>

234
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,390
<font color="yellow">with a female doctor.</font>

235
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,490
<font color="yellow">So am I, Chairman Shin.</font>

236
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,290
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- Put yourself in my shoes.</font>

237
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,720
<font color="yellow">If I told you I felt uncomfortable treating you because you're a male,</font>

238
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,390
<font color="yellow">would you feel pleased?</font>

239
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,990
<font color="yellow">Then let's call this off.</font>

240
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,650
<font color="yellow">Get me a new doctor.</font>

241
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,520
<font color="yellow">That can't be done.</font>

242
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,550
<font color="yellow">I'm a doctor and you're a patient.</font>

243
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,020
<font color="yellow">If you have any complaints in the future regarding the treatments,</font>

244
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,590
<font color="yellow">I'd be happy to oblige,</font>

245
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,990
<font color="yellow">but if you make complaints regarding any other issues,</font>

246
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,750
<font color="yellow">I'll just ignore them.</font>

247
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,850
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

248
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,890
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

249
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,290
<font color="yellow">Are you joking around with me?</font>

250
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,350
<font color="yellow">I'm trying not to be intimidated by you.</font>

251
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,620
<font color="yellow">If I don't, I won't be able to proceed with the treatments.</font>

252
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,290
<font color="yellow">When did you start coughing?</font>

253
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,950
<font color="yellow">When people get old,</font>

254
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,720
<font color="yellow">it comes naturally.</font>

255
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,550
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know that information.</font>

256
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,590
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

257
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,690
<font color="yellow">Please change into a hospital gown.</font>

258
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,750
<font color="yellow">Please check his temperature...</font>

259
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,750
<font color="yellow">- and his blood sample.
- Yes, Doctor.</font>

260
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,320
<font color="yellow">Until later, then.</font>

261
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,550
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim.
- Hello.</font>

262
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,950
<font color="yellow">Have you gone out of your mind, Dr. Yoon?</font>

263
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,290
<font color="yellow">Ignore him?</font>

264
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,820
<font color="yellow">He's not the one to be ignored.</font>

265
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,720
<font color="yellow">What was I supposed to do, then?</font>

266
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,620
<font color="yellow">Should I sue a patient for sexual discrimination?</font>

267
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

268
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,850
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

269
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,790
<font color="yellow">you can run the tests on him without running into a problem?</font>

270
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,920
<font color="yellow">I'll finish running the tests in two hours...</font>

271
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,950
<font color="yellow">and get him to rest.</font>

272
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,490
<font color="yellow">Is there anything I should take care of?</font>

273
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,660
<font color="yellow">There isn't.</font>

274
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,790
<font color="yellow">- Off you go, then.
- Okay.</font>

275
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,920
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let her be like that?</font>

276
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,920
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see how rude she was to Chairman Shin?</font>

277
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,020
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

278
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,520
<font color="yellow">The moment a doctor gets intimidated by the patient,</font>

279
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,990
<font color="yellow">the whole medical treatment goes down the drain.</font>

280
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,750
<font color="yellow">She's doing everything by the books.</font>

281
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,250
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim.
- Yes?</font>

282
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,790
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you pay him a visit?</font>

283
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,620
<font color="yellow">He's looking for you.</font>

284
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,450
<font color="yellow">I'm very busy right now. Tell him I'll come by later.</font>

285
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,190
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

286
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,350
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't neglect a VIP patient.</font>

287
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,120
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

288
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,620
<font color="yellow">This is Dr. Kang.</font>

289
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,220
<font color="yellow">We have an emergency patient, Dr. Kang.</font>

290
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,160
<font color="yellow">It's a 7-year-old boy with a 10cm-long lacerated wound.</font>

291
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,190
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way.</font>

292
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,660
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

293
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
<font color="yellow">He's refusing to be tested?</font>

294
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,250
<font color="yellow">Yes. He keeps asking for Master Kim.</font>

295
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,190
<font color="yellow">- Did you take his blood?
- He won't let me.</font>

296
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,990
<font color="yellow">His body temperature is 38.3°C.</font>

297
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,550
<font color="yellow">Give me that.</font>

298
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,950
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take your blood, Chairman Shin.</font>

299
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,320
<font color="yellow">When did the coughing get more severe?</font>

300
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,050
<font color="yellow">It became more frequent since last week.</font>

301
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,520
<font color="yellow">Does he have phlegm?</font>

302
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,850
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

303
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,750
<font color="yellow">Have you checked the color of it?</font>

304
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,350
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

305
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,250
<font color="yellow">I was watching that.</font>

306
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,690
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

307
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,450
<font color="yellow">I'm treating a patient right now.</font>

308
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,690
<font color="yellow">You can keep watching after I'm done.</font>

309
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,720
<font color="yellow">I told you I don't want to be treated by you.</font>

310
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,290
<font color="yellow">Bring me Master Kim right now.</font>

311
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,050
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much money he took from me?</font>

312
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,620
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to let someone like you treat me.</font>

313
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,160
<font color="yellow">Someone like me is more than capable of doing this.</font>

314
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,620
<font color="yellow">So let me listen to your chest.</font>

315
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,220
<font color="yellow">Get Master Kim to do it!</font>

316
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,950
<font color="yellow">You might have pneumonia, Chairman Shin.</font>

317
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,390
<font color="yellow">- What?
- If that's the case,</font>

318
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,320
<font color="yellow">you need to take antibiotics right away.</font>

319
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,620
<font color="yellow">If not, we won't be able to put you under general anesthesia.</font>

320
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,420
<font color="yellow">That means no operation for you.</font>

321
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,490
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

322
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,890
<font color="yellow">Not only that,</font>

323
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,620
<font color="yellow">but Master Kim will be furious with me.</font>

324
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,490
<font color="yellow">He'll call me an idiot who couldn't even diagnosis pneumonia...</font>

325
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,350
<font color="yellow">and a quack who doesn't belong here.</font>

326
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,520
<font color="yellow">Well, that's...</font>

327
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,620
<font color="yellow">You've never heard of...</font>

328
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,890
<font color="yellow">Master Kim ranting, have you?</font>

329
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,790
<font color="yellow">The worst thing in the world is to be scolded by Master Kim.</font>

330
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
<font color="yellow">That being said,</font>

331
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,390
<font color="yellow">please cooperate with me.</font>

332
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,820
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

333
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,390
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

334
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,050
<font color="yellow">I'll start with the auscultation.</font>

335
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,490
<font color="yellow">Take a deep breath.</font>

336
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,050
<font color="yellow">Exhale.</font>

337
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,520
<font color="yellow">One more time.</font>

338
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,950
<font color="yellow">Inhale.</font>

339
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,950
<font color="yellow">Once more.</font>

340
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,220
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look at your scar.</font>

341
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,020
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

342
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,520
<font color="yellow">It won't hurt if I...</font>

343
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,550
<font color="yellow">He fell from the slide at a playground.</font>

344
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,550
<font color="yellow">Did you fall on your head?</font>

345
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,550
<font color="yellow">He must have.</font>

346
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,390
<font color="yellow">I don't know for sure.</font>

347
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,160
<font color="yellow">I didn't see him fall.</font>

348
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,690
<font color="yellow">Are your parents not here?</font>

349
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,350
<font color="yellow">They're both working right now.</font>

350
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,750
<font color="yellow">My mom said she can be here after 7pm.</font>

351
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,390
<font color="yellow">Please let me take a look.</font>

352
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,590
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Good boy.</font>

353
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,090
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

354
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,890
<font color="yellow">want this candy?</font>

355
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,720
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Don't you like sweets?</font>

356
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,490
<font color="yellow">I want two.</font>

357
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,450
<font color="yellow">If you let us treat you...</font>

358
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,550
<font color="yellow">Surprise.</font>

359
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,450
<font color="yellow">I'll give you two more.</font>

360
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,950
<font color="yellow">Can we take a look at it now?</font>

361
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,820
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

362
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,320
<font color="yellow">You're good at this.</font>

363
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,020
<font color="yellow">This is nothing.</font>

364
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,950
<font color="yellow">Can I take a look at you now?</font>

365
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,390
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

366
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,520
<font color="yellow">It'll sting a little.</font>

367
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,150
<font color="yellow">I'll have to stitch up the open wound.</font>

368
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,420
<font color="yellow">After that, let's run him through a brain CT.</font>

369
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

370
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,690
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

371
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,890
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

372
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,090
<font color="yellow">Are you not feeling well?</font>

373
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,650
<font color="yellow">I'm just a bit tired.</font>

374
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,550
<font color="yellow">Should I page a different doctor?</font>

375
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,750
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll do it.</font>

376
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,520
<font color="yellow">He's been overdoing himself all this time.</font>

377
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,920
<font color="yellow">He has.</font>

378
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,350
<font color="yellow">It's an emergency patient!</font>

379
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,720
<font color="yellow">Soo Jeong!</font>

380
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,590
<font color="yellow">Don't die. Don't die on me.</font>

381
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,750
<font color="yellow">This way.</font>

382
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,350
<font color="yellow">- Move away.
- Don't die.</font>

383
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,320
<font color="yellow">- What happened?
- She became unconscious from pills.</font>

384
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,720
<font color="yellow">- One, two, three.
- Two, three.</font>

385
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

386
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,050
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

387
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,920
<font color="yellow">My son is running a high fever.</font>

388
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,190
<font color="yellow">Please come this way.</font>

389
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,150
<font color="yellow">Ms. Eom.</font>

391
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,590
<font color="yellow">- He has pneumonia?
- Yes.</font>

392
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,990
<font color="yellow">His chest sounds are not good and his temperature is 38.7°C.</font>

393
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,950
<font color="yellow">We're running tests on sputum smear and blood culture.</font>

394
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,950
<font color="yellow">According as Community-Acquired Pneumonia,</font>

395
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,390
<font color="yellow">give him injections of triaxone.</font>

396
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

397
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,290
<font color="yellow">There's something else.</font>

398
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,890
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

399
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,320
<font color="yellow">This is a different model of artificial heart...</font>

400
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,250
<font color="yellow">than the one in Chairman Shin.</font>

401
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,920
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin's artificial heart is Model A.</font>

402
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,720
<font color="yellow">That model is reported to be defected.</font>

403
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,450
<font color="yellow">I heard it could get discontinued soon.</font>

404
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,750
<font color="yellow">Are you considering...</font>

405
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,690
<font color="yellow">the replacement of his artificial heart?</font>

406
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,050
<font color="yellow">Go over the data thoroughly.</font>

407
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,620
<font color="yellow">We'll talk about the details at the conference meeting.</font>

408
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,890
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

409
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,420
<font color="yellow">This is going to be tough.</font>

410
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,520
<font color="yellow">In Soo, are you leaving already?</font>

411
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,720
<font color="yellow">Is it 6pm?</font>

412
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,820
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

413
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,890
<font color="yellow">In fact, my wife and mother-in-law are here already.</font>

414
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,390
<font color="yellow">So I'm leaving a bit early today.</font>

415
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,090
<font color="yellow">But still, you should stay here until 6pm.</font>

416
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,090
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin shows signs of pneumonia, so I'll be busy by then.</font>

417
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,390
<font color="yellow">Actually, I asked Dong Joo to take care of the emergency room.</font>

418
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. My mother-in-law is so fussy.</font>

419
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,720
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

420
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,150
<font color="yellow">That's her.</font>

421
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,320
<font color="yellow">I will come back as soon as possible after dinner. I'm sorry.</font>

422
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,850
<font color="yellow">Hello? Are you here?</font>

423
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,120
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be there.</font>

424
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,890
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Dong Joo and I are such pushovers.</font>

425
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,450
<font color="yellow">Don't even ask me. I won't carry on the duty instead of him.</font>

426
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,690
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo has been on duty for three days in a row.</font>

427
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,720
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel sorry for him?</font>

428
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,990
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

429
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,290
<font color="yellow">I will be right back after checking Chairman Shin's condition.</font>

430
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,350
<font color="yellow">Can't you do that for me?</font>

431
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,050
<font color="yellow">I said no. I have a lot to do.</font>

432
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,950
<font color="yellow">Okay. You are so cheap and nasty.</font>

433
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,490
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

434
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,920
<font color="yellow">I will be there in a second.</font>

435
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,620
<font color="yellow">Don't ever ask me to carry on duty for you.</font>

436
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,890
<font color="yellow">I will never do that.</font>

437
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,690
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

438
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,620
<font color="yellow">He's not just changing the batteries...</font>

439
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,590
<font color="yellow">but replacing the artificial heart?</font>

440
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,350
<font color="yellow">I guess that's the plan.</font>

441
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,890
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this. He always gets his own way.</font>

442
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,990
<font color="yellow">It seems difficult to go ahead with the surgery, though.</font>

443
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,220
<font color="yellow">Apparently, Chairman Shin is showing signs of pneumonia.</font>

444
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,720
<font color="yellow">I think they'll have to postpone it a few days because of inflammation.</font>

445
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,250
<font color="yellow">Okay. Keep me updated on what's going on.</font>

446
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,790
<font color="yellow">Replacing the artificial heart?</font>

447
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,820
<font color="yellow">Soo Jeong, are you all right?</font>

448
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,320
<font color="yellow">Wake up, Soo Jeong. I'm sorry.</font>

449
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,350
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me.
- Yes.</font>

450
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,050
<font color="yellow">What medicines did she take? Do you have them with you?</font>

451
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,050
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

452
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,750
<font color="yellow">There you are.</font>

453
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,190
<font color="yellow">She took a handful of them.</font>

454
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,120
<font color="yellow">What's your relationship with her?</font>

455
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,390
<font color="yellow">I'm her boyfriend.</font>

456
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,150
<font color="yellow">In fact, we had a little fight.</font>

457
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

458
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,250
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

459
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,650
<font color="yellow">Can you please wait outside while I check her condition?</font>

460
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,850
<font color="yellow">This way, please.</font>

461
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,590
<font color="yellow">Soo Jeong, please don't die. Hang in there.</font>

462
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,420
<font color="yellow">Miss, please get up now.</font>

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,750
<font color="yellow">They won't pick up.</font>

<font color="yellow">(JEONGSEON PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER)</font>

624
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,450
<font color="yellow">It looks like...</font>

625
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,020
<font color="yellow">everyone has gone home.</font>

626
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,390

627
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,120
<font color="yellow">I did, but they only told me...</font>

- Okay.</font>

<font color="yellow">But...</font>

634
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,950

<font color="yellow">So send the patients to a designated hospital.</font>

639
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,060
<font color="yellow">We have given those hospitals everything they need,</font>

640
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,220
<font color="yellow">so if you send them over...</font>

641
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,320
<font color="yellow">We have three patients here.</font>

642

644
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,590
<font color="yellow">you can just call the 911.</font>

<font color="yellow">How are we supposed to go back and forth three times...</font>

648
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,250
<font color="yellow">to Gangneung, which is two hours away?</font>

649
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,020
<font color="yellow">Do you want us to do that all night long?</font>

650
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,150
<font color="yellow">If one ambulance is not enough,</font>

651
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,650
<font color="yellow">you can call a private ambulance.</font>

652
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,820
<font color="yellow">Stop talking with such nonsense!</font>

653
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,020
<font color="yellow">All of the emergency crew members must wear protection suits...</font>

654
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,150
<font color="yellow">to transfer the suspected patients of MERS.</font>

655
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,620

00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,720
<font color="yellow">How can you tell us to call a private ambulance?</font>

659
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

660
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,560
<font color="yellow">Like I said...</font>

661
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,590
<font color="yellow">we have given everything you need to the designated hospital.</font>

662
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,420
<font color="yellow">You just have to transfer them there.</font>

663
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,520
<font color="yellow">Transferring them itself is the big problem here!</font>

664
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,850
<font color="yellow">Just the transfer!</font>

665
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,950
<font color="yellow">Why can't you understand?</font>

666
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,520
<font color="yellow">You are the central control center!</font>

667

<font color="yellow">Understanding is...</font>

668
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,590
<font color="yellow">Did you just talk down to me?</font>

669
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,390
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

670
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,820
<font color="yellow">We need to find a way to work around this.</font>

671
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,560
<font color="yellow">Screaming at me won't solve any of these problems.</font>

672
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,820
<font color="yellow">Forget about it. I'm hanging up, you idiot!</font>

673
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,790
<font color="yellow">You are unbelievable. Hello?</font>

683
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,190
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you down here?</font>

684
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,850
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear what I said about keeping your post?</font>

685
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,490
<font color="yellow">What will happen to those people...</font>

686
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,420
<font color="yellow">in the emergency room?</font>

687
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,250
<font color="yellow">What's your plan?</font>

688
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,520
<font color="yellow">We're trying to reach the public health center.</font>

689
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,090
<font color="yellow">You should keep your post upstairs.</font>

690

<font color="yellow">The possible MERS patients are...</font>

694
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,390
<font color="yellow">moved to the hybrid room.</font>

695
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,820
<font color="yellow">We have separated them from us with quarantine plastic curtain.</font>

696
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,820
<font color="yellow">What about other patients?</font>

697
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,250
<font color="yellow">We have not informed them about the situation yet.</font>

698
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,720
<font color="yellow">I thought it would cause a big turmoil if they find out.</font>

699
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,790
<font color="yellow">I think you should still tell them about it.</font>

700
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,750
<font color="yellow">Get blood samples of the possible MERS patients,</font>

701
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,990
<font color="yellow">and take the samples of their sputum as well.</font>

<font color="yellow">Leave it out the back door,</font>

<font color="yellow">After that,</font>

00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,820
<font color="yellow">Do you want us all die together?</font>

773
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,420
<font color="yellow">People from the public health center will come...</font>

774
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,920
<font color="yellow">and take each of you home.</font>

775
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,150
<font color="yellow">Until then, you are not allowed to leave this hospital.</font>

776
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,390
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I can't believe this.</font>

777
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,020
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

778
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,820
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

779
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,590
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

780
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,050
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

781
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,350
<font color="yellow">Sir, please stop it.</font>

782
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,890
<font color="yellow">That's enough already! Please go back to your bed.</font>

783
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,490
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

784
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,250
<font color="yellow">I said, let go!</font>

785
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,650
<font color="yellow">Why should I stay with MERS patients?</font>

786
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,490
<font color="yellow">Move away. Open the door!</font>

787
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,690
<font color="yellow">There are also children in here.</font>

788
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,690
<font color="yellow">Please don't arouse anxiety by raising your voice.</font>

789
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,690
<font color="yellow">Follow our instructions for now.</font>

790
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,290
<font color="yellow">Open the door right now!</font>

791
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,820
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, sir. Please stop making a scene and go back to your bed.</font>

792
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,620
<font color="yellow">- You might cause a bigger turmoil.
- Gosh.</font>

793
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,420
<font color="yellow">- Do you understand?
- You jerks.</font>

794
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,520
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

795
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,990
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
- Soo Jeong.</font>

796
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,090
<font color="yellow">Soo Jeong, what's wrong? What is the matter?</font>

797
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,620
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, what's wrong? Where does it hurt?</font>

798
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,890
<font color="yellow">My stomach... My gosh.</font>

799
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,890
<font color="yellow">It hurts so much.</font>

800
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,950
<font color="yellow">Please lie on your back for me.</font>

801
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:35,690
<font color="yellow">With your knees bent.</font>

802
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,690
<font color="yellow">I'll press your abdomen for a second.</font>

803
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,590
<font color="yellow">- Does it hurt here?
- A little bit.</font>

804
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,220
<font color="yellow">When you press there, the right side hurts even more.</font>

805
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,850
<font color="yellow">Rovsing's Sign?</font>

806
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,020
<font color="yellow">How about here?</font>

807
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:59,050
<font color="yellow">This time, I'll press your abdomen a little longer.</font>

808
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,250
<font color="yellow">Please hang in there.</font>

809
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,950
<font color="yellow">What? Acute appendicitis?</font>

810
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,820
<font color="yellow">Yes, she has severe rebound tenderness,</font>

811
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,950
<font color="yellow">and shows Rovsing's sign and Dunphy's sign.</font>

812
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,950
<font color="yellow">First, check her OP lab.</font>

813
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,890
<font color="yellow">- Please check her OP lab.
- Yes, Dr. Kang.</font>

814
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,750
<font color="yellow">Can she wait for the anti-contamination clothing?</font>

815
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:34,550
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure yet.</font>

816
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,720
<font color="yellow">I think I'll have to see.</font>

817
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:41,390
<font color="yellow">Let me know if she's about to fall into a critical condition.</font>

818
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim.</font>

819
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,420
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh, please administer one ampoule of tramadol via IV.</font>

820
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dr. Kang.</font>

821
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,590
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

822
00:50:59,614 --> 00:51:11,614
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

823
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,520
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

824
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,650
<font color="yellow">We have an acute appendicitis patient in the emergency room.</font>

825
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,720
<font color="yellow">Get ready for a surgery.</font>

826
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,450
<font color="yellow">My shift is over.</font>

827
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,520
<font color="yellow">It can worsen the situation if she doesn't get a surgery.</font>

828
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,820
<font color="yellow">Let's prevent it while we can.</font>

829
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,320
<font color="yellow">You know the situation we're in right now.</font>

830
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,820
<font color="yellow">Why would I cut open the possible MERS patient's abdomen?</font>

831
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,350
<font color="yellow">It's not contagious because the incubation period hasn't passed.</font>

832
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,720
<font color="yellow">There is a zero percent chance you'll get MERS.</font>

833
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,250
<font color="yellow">Still, I don't want to do that. I refuse to perform that surgery.</font>

834
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,320
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Gosh.</font>

835
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,090
<font color="yellow">Doctors are humans, too.</font>

836
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,320
<font color="yellow">Doctors get sick, and we can get MERS, too.</font>

837
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,390
<font color="yellow">If we're unlucky, we can die from it. You know?</font>

838
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,250
<font color="yellow">I have my rights to protect my own life. You should know that.</font>

839
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,090
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

840
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,150
<font color="yellow">You are absolutely right about everything you said.</font>

841
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,650
<font color="yellow">That's why you should get ready, you jerk!</font>

842
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,550
<font color="yellow">Darn it!</font>

843
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,350
<font color="yellow">Give me protection suit first.</font>

844
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,550
<font color="yellow">Master Kim. Master Kim.</font>

845
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,190
<font color="yellow">What now? What is it?</font>

846
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,620
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang Dong Joo is...</font>

847
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,790
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang, are you okay?</font>

848
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,550
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I'm all right.</font>

849
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,250
<font color="yellow">You can't go on like this. Please go take a rest, Dr. Kang.</font>

850
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,950
<font color="yellow">It's not that bad, Ms. Oh.</font>

851
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,120
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Kang!
- Dr. Kang!</font>

852
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,990
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang, wake up.</font>

853
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,250
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

854
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,450
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo.</font>

855
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,320
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo!</font>

856
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,790
<font color="yellow">No, Master Kim. You can't go in there.</font>

857
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,320
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang, wake up.</font>

858
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,390
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

859
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,720
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

860
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,420
<font color="yellow">Master Kim, Dr. Kang is unconscious.</font>

861
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,250
<font color="yellow">His pulse is weak, and he has fever.</font>

862
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,720
<font color="yellow">What should we do, Master Kim?</font>

863
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,590
<font color="yellow">Please give us an order.</font>

864
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:59,450
<font color="yellow">Put him on a bed, and check his vital signs.</font>

865
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:04,420
<font color="yellow">I will call you right back.</font>

866
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,690
<font color="yellow">- Let's move him to a bed.
- Yes, Ms. Oh.</font>

867
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,020
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

868
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,190
<font color="yellow">I knew one of us would end up dying because of him.</font>

869
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:33,750
<font color="yellow">Mr. Goo.</font>

870
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,520
<font color="yellow">Bring me N95 masks and gowns.</font>

871
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,320
<font color="yellow">I will get in.</font>

872
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,290
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

873
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,190
<font color="yellow">Did Dong Joo faint?</font>

874
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,720
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

875
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,850
<font color="yellow">He seems to be in a critical condition.</font>

876
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:08,450
<font color="yellow">So who is in the emergency room now?</font>

877
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,450
<font color="yellow">No one.</font>

878
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,850
<font color="yellow">No one?</font>

879
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,690
<font color="yellow">Are you saying there is no doctor in the emergency room?</font>

880
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,820
<font color="yellow">What about Dong Joo?</font>

881
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,220
<font color="yellow">Who is taking care of him?</font>

882
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:22,650
<font color="yellow">Hold yourself together, Dr. Kang.</font>

883
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,320
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

884
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,890
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

885
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,850
<font color="yellow">His vital signs are not good, Ms. Oh.</font>

886
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:34,850
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

887
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:41,990
<font color="yellow">You can't do that, Master Kim.</font>

888
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:43,950
<font color="yellow">President Yeo.</font>

889
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,150
<font color="yellow">I don't even have time for this.</font>

890
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,990
<font color="yellow">You are the control tower of this hospital.</font>

891
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,290
<font color="yellow">You can't just get carried away by your feelings...</font>

892
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:53,750
<font color="yellow">and get into the emergency room now.</font>

893
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,620
<font color="yellow">What about the public health center?</font>

894
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,820
<font color="yellow">Our staff are on the way.</font>

895
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,690
<font color="yellow">Dr. Song.</font>

896
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,420
<font color="yellow">Perform the operation as soon as we get the protection suits.</font>

897
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,390
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I'm not performing the operation.</font>

898
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,420
<font color="yellow">You only think about yourself in a situation like this.</font>

899
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,920
<font color="yellow">Do you still call yourself a doctor?</font>

900
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,950
<font color="yellow">You can see your junior doctor is lying in the bed right there.</font>

901
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,420
<font color="yellow">How dare you say such a thing?</font>

902
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,750
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

903
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,390
<font color="yellow">Please think it all through once again.</font>

904
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,020
<font color="yellow">You can't do this with Chairman Shin's operation ahead.</font>

905
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,150
<font color="yellow">Do you know what they say about this situation?</font>

906
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,290
<font color="yellow">For patients,</font>

907
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,250
<font color="yellow">it's not the order of arrival. It's the order of emergency.</font>

908
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,950
<font color="yellow">The emergency patient here is not Chairman Shin.</font>

909
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,620
<font color="yellow">That's the patients in the emergency room.</font>

910
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,750
<font color="yellow">I will get in there.</font>

911
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,720
<font color="yellow">I will get in the emergency room.</font>

912
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,520
<font color="yellow">I will get in there.</font>

913
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,690
<font color="yellow">Please let me.</font>

914
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,120
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon.</font>

915
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:01,550
<font color="yellow">I told you...</font>

916
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,990
<font color="yellow">to keep your position.</font>

917
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:05,790
<font color="yellow">Just go.</font>

918
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,220
<font color="yellow">I've completed the change-over already.</font>

919
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,620
<font color="yellow">I'm Do In Beom, sir.</font>

920
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,790
<font color="yellow">I will be taking care of you...</font>

921
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,790
<font color="yellow">instead of Dr. Yoon Seo Jung.</font>

922
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,490
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

923
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,790
<font color="yellow">Who told you to do so?</font>

924
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,590
