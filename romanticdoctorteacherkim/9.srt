4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,050
<font color="yellow">I heard that you were being interrogated.</font>

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,240
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that it didn't end so soon.</font>

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,950
<font color="yellow">How dare you try to do the chairman's
surgery in your lowly position?</font>

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,840
<font color="yellow">Look at the mess you've made.</font>

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,950
<font color="yellow">Looks like you'll lose another precious

<font color="yellow">Doctor!</font>

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,150

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,540
<font color="yellow">A guest?</font>

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,150
<font color="yellow">Teacher Kim!
Hey, there. I'm here.</font>

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,940
<font color="yellow">I heard you told me to
admit myself to the hospital.</font>

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:02,040
<font color="yellow">I contacted the chairman with
the news just as you told me to, sir.</font>

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,650
<font color="yellow">Why are you just standing there?</font>

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,740
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and escort me to my room.</font>

19

stupid like this, you bastard?</font>

20

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Chairman.</font>

21
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,650
<font color="yellow">I think that there's been a mistake here.</font>

22
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,740
<font color="yellow">We're not ready to
accommodate you here yet.</font>

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,150
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,240
<font color="yellow">- Teacher Kim.
- You've come such a long way.</font>

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to have to
send you back like this.</font>

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,280
<font color="yellow">We'll admit you as soon
as we're ready...</font>

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,440
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,350
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I told you that
you're forbidden from working.</font>

29
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,240
<font color="yellow">Forbidden from working?</font>

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,790
<font color="yellow">Hey... hey.</font>

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,850
<font color="yellow">I cannot allow you to treat any patients
until we're done with our investigation.</font>

32
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,800
<font color="yellow">And if you disobey us, you could
suffer an even worse punishment.</font>

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,750
<font color="yellow">Who the hell are you punks?</font>

34
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,840
<font color="yellow">What do you mean,
he's forbidden from working?</font>

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,050
<font color="yellow">Says whom?</font>

36
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,050
<font color="yellow">I'll explain, Chairman.</font>

37
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,740
<font color="yellow">- What happened is...
- Look here, Teacher Kim.</font>

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,240
<font color="yellow">You explain this.</font>

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,840
<font color="yellow">Tell me what's going on here, exactly.</font>

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,840
<font color="yellow">And who are those punks?</font>

41
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,950
<font color="yellow">The hospital is under
investigation right now, Chairman.</font>

42
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,650
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey, Kang Dong Joo!</font>

43
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,550
<font color="yellow">We have no idea why Geosan sent
investigators down here to us</font>

44
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,840
<font color="yellow">and we have no idea why they're
putting pressure on us, either.</font>

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,340
<font color="yellow">Hey. Shut your mouth.</font>

46
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,050
<font color="yellow">Why should I shut my mouth?</font>

47
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,360
<font color="yellow">We're the ones being treated unfairly
when we didn't do anything wrong.</font>

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,450
<font color="yellow">You're the Chairman of the Geosan
University Hospital Foundation, correct?</font>

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,340
<font color="yellow">Could you possibly file
a complaint with Geosan</font>

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,450
<font color="yellow">for pressuring Doldam Hospital
like this for no reason?</font>

53
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,650
<font color="yellow">Manager Joo.</font>

54
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chairman?</font>

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,910
<font color="yellow">- Call Director Do, now.
- Chairman.</font>

56
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,340
<font color="yellow">Tell him to come down here now and
explain this situation to me in person.</font>

57
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
<font color="yellow">Right now!</font>

58
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,950
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

59
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,650
<font color="yellow">Tell me what I did wrong.</font>

60
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,260
<font color="yellow">Why did you call the chairman here?</font>

61
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,240
<font color="yellow">I couldn't just sit and watch while
Seo Jung was being treated unfairly.</font>

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,740
<font color="yellow">And I figured that we needed someone
to resolve this situation for us.</font>

63
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,150
<font color="yellow">Do you really think that Chairman Shin
will be the one to resolve this?</font>

64
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,650
<font color="yellow">To be honest, the only one who can
pressure Director Do is the chairman.</font>

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,840
<font color="yellow">Furthermore,
Chairman Shin is on your side.</font>

66
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,450
<font color="yellow">If I'd known that you
were such an idiot before...</font>

67
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,450
<font color="yellow">But you know, you really are ignorant
to the ways of this world, aren't you?</font>

68
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,740
<font color="yellow">You're really naive, huh?</font>

69
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,650
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,950
<font color="yellow">What? Chairman Shin has summoned me?</font>

71
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, but...</font>

72
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,650
<font color="yellow">you needn't put yourself
through the trouble, sir.</font>

73
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,660
<font color="yellow">I'll just watch over the situation
and do as I deem fit, sir.</font>

74
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,540
<font color="yellow">No, there's no need.</font>

75
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,840
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,950
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that, sir?</font>

77
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,520
<font color="yellow">Our opponents just gave us a
light jab to see how we'd respond</font>

78
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,450
<font color="yellow">but you took that as an opportunity,
and thus escalated the situation.</font>

79
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:41,040
<font color="yellow">I was actually wondering how that
old fart would find out about this.</font>

80
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,650
<font color="yellow">Good. They've set the
stage for us themselves.</font>

81
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,250
<font color="yellow">All I have to do now is go
and report the facts to him.</font>

82
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,840
<font color="yellow">Well, this might actually end up
being a good thing for you.</font>

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,250
<font color="yellow">You'll score some points with
Director Do, at the very least.</font>

84
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,290
<font color="yellow">Even though Yoon Seo Jung is screwed.</font>

85
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,870
<font color="yellow">Aren't you being a bit too harsh, sir?
What do you mean, she's screwed?</font>

86
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,250
<font color="yellow">You have no idea what kind of
person Director Do really is, do you?</font>

87
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:15,150
<font color="yellow"><i>He'd be willing to do anything and
everything to get what he wants.</i></font>

88
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,340
<font color="yellow">And Chairman Shin is someone who made
a guy like him the hospital's director</font>

89
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,150
<font color="yellow">and sits idly by while
reaping the benefits from that.</font>

90
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,950
<font color="yellow">He's on my side?
Give me a break.</font>

91
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,250
<font color="yellow">He doesn't need me.
He needs my operation.</font>

92
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,040

104
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,450
<font color="yellow">Can you be a bit more specific?</font>

105
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,650
<font color="yellow">One time, he saved me while
I was passed out in the mountains.</font>

106
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,840
<font color="yellow">And one time, he treated my wrist
when it had almost lost functionality.</font>

107
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,340
<font color="yellow">That's how he saved me twice.</font>

<font color="yellow">Wait, no.</font>

109
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,750

110
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,450

because of him, too.</font>

111
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,750

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,940
<font color="yellow">if a person broke into the OR and
held someone hostage with a sickle.</font>

147
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,040
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

148
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,940
<font color="yellow">They even left that criminal alone
with a patient who had been operated on.</font>

149
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,940
<font color="yellow">And because Teacher Kim was the one
to handle the situation, nobody was hurt.</font>

150
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,250
<font color="yellow">And they performed an expensive treatment
on a patient who cannot pay for it.</font>

151
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,350
<font color="yellow">Saving the patient is our priority.</font>

152
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,250
<font color="yellow">The hospital bill can be
taken care of after that, Director Do!</font>

153
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,540
<font color="yellow">And how are you going
to explain the fact</font>

154
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,850
<font color="yellow">that the doctor who ordered
the treatment has PTSD?</font>

155
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,940
<font color="yellow">PT what? What's that?</font>

156
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,850
<font color="yellow">It refers to post-traumatic
stress disorder, sir.</font>

157
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,350
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoon Seo Jung made
a full recovery two years ago.</font>

158
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,350
<font color="yellow">I heard that there was a drug overdose
incident involving her recently.</font>

159
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,150
<font color="yellow">And Director Yeo and Bu Yong Joo
were both aware of that.</font>

160
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,350
<font color="yellow">Yet, they were keeping it hidden.</font>

161
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,350
<font color="yellow">As such, these two have
been negligent of their duty.</font>

163
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,350
<font color="yellow">Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.</font>

164
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,850
<font color="yellow">What is it that you truly wish to say?</font>

165
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,350
<font color="yellow">I can't just sit by and watch
as these abnormalities occur</font>

166
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,040
<font color="yellow">at this poor excuse of a hospital.
That's what I truly wish to say.</font>

167
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,350
<font color="yellow">You mustn't entrust such an
important thing as your surgery</font>

168
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,850
<font color="yellow">to this sorry excuse
of a hospital, Chairman.</font>

169
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,650
<font color="yellow">Please reconsider entrusting
your surgery to Bu Yong Joo, sir.</font>

170
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,350
<font color="yellow">So that's what it is.</font>

171
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,260
<font color="yellow">You caused an uproar just to stop
Teacher Kim from performing the surgery?</font>

172
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,940
<font color="yellow">Watch your words, Director Yeo!</font>

173
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,350
<font color="yellow">Oh, whatever. That's enough.</font>

174
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,350
<font color="yellow">Chairman.</font>

175
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,850
<font color="yellow">This is my surgery, and I've already
made up my mind regarding this.</font>

176
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,940
<font color="yellow">So stop arguing about it, already.</font>

177
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:17,650
<font color="yellow">I'll have things proceed as originally
planned, so just be aware of that.</font>

178
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:25,940
<font color="yellow">And let's end things here by firing
that doctor who caused all this trouble.</font>

179
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,160
<font color="yellow">Now stop causing such a
ruckus at this hospital.</font>

180
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,840
<font color="yellow">We can't, Chairman!
Doctor Yoon Seo Jung is...</font>

181
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,650
<font color="yellow">Let's just end things there.
Okay, Director Yeo?</font>

182
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, wow.</font>

183
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,750
<font color="yellow">You really don't get what's
going on here, do you, Chairman?</font>

184
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,850
<font color="yellow">What did you just say? Hey.</font>

185
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,650
<font color="yellow">The one Director Do
really wants to fire is me.</font>

186
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,040
<font color="yellow">That's what he really wants.</font>

187
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,650
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Director Do?</font>

188
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,150
<font color="yellow">At the very least</font>

189
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,150
<font color="yellow">you must take responsibility for
letting a PTSD patient treat people.</font>

190
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,650
<font color="yellow">Oh, you got the neuropsychiatrist's
clinical notes already?</font>

191
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,040
<font color="yellow">PTSD, huh?</font>

192
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,380
<font color="yellow">Or did you already decide the results
of her evaluation from the start</font>

193
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,850
<font color="yellow">and just have her
interviewed as a formality?</font>

194
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,940
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to avoid shouldering
your part of the blame, either.</font>

195
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,250
<font color="yellow">The duty of ER doctors is to save
dying people, no matter what it takes.</font>

196
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,350
<font color="yellow">Asking them why they used an
expensive treatment on a patient</font>

197
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:30,150
<font color="yellow">is the same thing as asking why someone
falling from a plane used a parachute.</font>

198
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:35,160
<font color="yellow">So? Do you even know how much
the hospital will suffer in losses?</font>

199
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,650
<font color="yellow">Stop giving a doctor
lessons in economics.</font>

200
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,040
<font color="yellow">You can't get by nowadays
by merely being a skilled doctor.</font>

201
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,940
<font color="yellow">A doctor can only survive
if his hospital does.</font>

202
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,650
<font color="yellow">Wow, you say these things and yet
you call yourself a hospital director?</font>

203
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,850
<font color="yellow">No, the order is all messed up there.</font>

204
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,930
<font color="yellow">The patient needs to survive
for the hospital to survive.</font>

205
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,940
<font color="yellow">Those are the basic
principles of being a doctor!</font>

206
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

207
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,750
<font color="yellow">I didn't realize that you valued
fundamentals and principles so much.</font>

208
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,440
<font color="yellow">Fine, then.
Let's do things that way.</font>

209
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,250
<font color="yellow">We'll maintain our hospital's principles
and continue with the investigation.</font>

210
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,250
<font color="yellow">And we'll issue proper punishments
for employing a doctor with PTSD</font>

211
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,350
<font color="yellow">after the official diagnosis comes out,
as per our principles.</font>

212
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,650
<font color="yellow">Look here, Director Do.</font>

213
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,940
<font color="yellow">As the one in charge of Geosan Hospital</font>

214
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,040
<font color="yellow">and in an attempt to rectify this wrong</font>

215
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,540
<font color="yellow">I'll do what I must to defend our
principles until the very end, Chairman.</font>

216
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,040
<font color="yellow">Have you finished your
conversation, Director?</font>

217
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,040
<font color="yellow">Make sure you get them good this time.</font>

218
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,850
<font color="yellow">No matter how long this may take.</font>

219
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

220
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,650
<font color="yellow">What is it that you wanted to say?</font>

221
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for continuing
to disappoint you.</font>

222
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,150
<font color="yellow">The reason I became a doctor</font>

223
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,940
<font color="yellow">was because I wanted to be
acknowledged by you, above all else.</font>

224
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,850
<font color="yellow">Because you saw potential in me
and made me want to become a doctor.</font>

225
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,250
<font color="yellow">And yet, you went ahead
and backstabbed me instead.</font>

226
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,040
<font color="yellow">Just let him have this one, Teacher Kim.</font>

227
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,140
<font color="yellow">I understand that you
treasure your disciple</font>

228
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:08,050
<font color="yellow">but you can't have this hospital
shut down just because of her.</font>

229
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,650
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

230
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,150
<font color="yellow">I really don't see a way
out of this one, Teacher Kim.</font>

231
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,440
<font color="yellow">Why did it have to be
Bu Yong Joo, of all people?</font>

232
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,350
<font color="yellow">Why were you hiding behind
someone like him, of all people?</font>

233
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,050
<font color="yellow">There was an incident.</font>

234
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,050
<font color="yellow">And he helped me through that.</font>

235
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,440
<font color="yellow">And did he tell you to hide
the fact that you have PTSD?</font>

236
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,940
<font color="yellow">I received treatment for three years
and thought I made a full recovery.</font>

237
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,740
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you what the
hell he told you to do!</font>

238
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,650
<font color="yellow">Teacher Kim didn't do anything wrong.</font>

239
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,240
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault that the
situation got this out of hand.</font>

240
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,650
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm lacking and incompetent.</font>

241
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,940
<font color="yellow">So... if someone needs to
take responsibility, I'll do it.</font>

242
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,550
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

243
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,940
<font color="yellow">will quit working here.</font>

244
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,850
<font color="yellow">How unfortunate.</font>

245
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,850
<font color="yellow">At the very least, I thought
of you as my own daughter.</font>

246
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,050
<font color="yellow">I guess you never saw me
as a parent, though.</font>

247
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,740
<font color="yellow">If you had really needed help,
you should've come and sought me out.</font>

248
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,740
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

249
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,440
<font color="yellow">Regarding Doldam Hospital, I'm
going to go by the book to resolve this.</font>

250
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
<font color="yellow">And as for you...</font>

251
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,050
<font color="yellow">you're dead to me now.</font>

252
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,550
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for something, sir?</font>

253
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,350
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to help you?</font>

254
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,650
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

255
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,850
<font color="yellow">Um... you haven't seen
Senior Seo Jung, have you?</font>

256
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,850
<font color="yellow">Senior Seo Jung?</font>

257
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,350
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen her since she
dropped by the ER a little while ago.</font>

258
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,240
<font color="yellow">Oh... really?</font>

259
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,850
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

260
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,350
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Doctor.</font>

261
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,650
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to call you
if I do end up seeing her?</font>

262
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,350
<font color="yellow">Um, yes, could you? Thank you.</font>

Doctor Yoon Seo Jung?</font>

265
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,350
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't.</font>

266
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

267
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,550
<font color="yellow">Has his condition
improved at all, Doctor?</font>

268
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,350
<font color="yellow">No, we'll have to keep
monitoring his progress for now.</font>

269
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,240
<font color="yellow">How much longer does
he have to remain like this?</font>

270
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,050
<font color="yellow">It almost feels like
I'm clinging to false hope.</font>

271
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,440
<font color="yellow">The fees for this treatment and for
the ICU are overwhelming enough.</font>

272
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,550
<font color="yellow">I feel like we'll only end up
being a burden to our kids.</font>

273
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,440
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that things must be hard,
but please don't give up until the end.</font>

274
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,050
<font color="yellow">And continue talking to the patient
and telling him pleasant things.</font>

275
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Am I really doing
the right thing right now?</i></font>

276
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,150
<font color="yellow">Did Doctor Yoon Seo Jung
come by here, by any chance?</font>

277
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,850
<font color="yellow">It seemed that she
stopped by the ICU for a bit.</font>

278
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,740
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if she's
still there, though.</font>

279
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,240
<font color="yellow"><i>Are we ever making the right
decision in front of our patients</i></font>

280
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,150
<font color="yellow"><i>while they teeter
between life and death?</i></font>

281
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,050
<font color="yellow">Yoon Seo Jung!
What brings you here?</font>

282
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:50,440
<font color="yellow"><i>Am I someone who is perfectly prepared to
take responsibility for someone's life?</i></font>

283
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,740
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, you don't see
Yoon Seo Jung around anywhere?</font>

284
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,350
<font color="yellow">We looked everywhere for her today,
but we can't find her anywhere.</font>

285
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,650
<font color="yellow">She won't pick up her phone, either.</font>

286
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,850
<font color="yellow">I think she heard about you being
suspended from duty back in the ER.</font>

287
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,650
<font color="yellow">- Oh, Teacher Kim.
- Yeah?</font>

288
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,350
<font color="yellow">Yoon Seo Jung stopped by my
restaurant not too long ago</font>

289
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,440
<font color="yellow">and wanted me to give you this.</font>

290
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,940
<font color="yellow"><i>[LETTER OF RESIGNATION]</i></font>

291
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,050
<font color="yellow">A letter of resignation?</font>

292
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,940
<font color="yellow">When did she give this to you?</font>

293
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,650
<font color="yellow">About 10 minutes ago.</font>

294
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,240
<font color="yellow"><i>[TEACHER KIM]</i></font>

295
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,940
<font color="yellow">Where are you headed?</font>

296
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,860
<font color="yellow"><i>The caller you are trying
to reach is unavailable.</i></font>

297
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,150
<font color="yellow">She's not picking up?</font>

298
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,650
<font color="yellow">Of course she wouldn't.</font>

299
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,640
<font color="yellow">If she even wrote a letter of resignation</font>

300
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,850
<font color="yellow">she's really made up her mind about this.</font>

301
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,350
<font color="yellow">Go and get her back here.</font>

302
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,260
<font color="yellow">How would he know where to look?</font>

303
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,440
<font color="yellow">Regardless of that,
we have to start searching first.</font>

304
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,240
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

305
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,650
<font color="yellow">bring her back by the end of today.</font>

306
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,940
<font color="yellow">If you can't bring her back
by the end of today</font>

307
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,440
<font color="yellow">I really will accept this letter.</font>

308
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,850
<font color="yellow">You got that?</font>

309
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,650
<font color="yellow">Oh, Doctor Kang Dong Joo!
Good thing I ran into you.</font>

310
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,050
<font color="yellow">- Your car just got here, so...
- That's great.</font>

311
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,650
<font color="yellow">- Well, actually...
- I'm busy right now.</font>

312
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,940
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later!</font>

313
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,650
<font color="yellow">That's... a new car.</font>

314
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,930
<font color="yellow">We're here.</font>

315
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,940
<font color="yellow">Where are you planning to go?</font>

316
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,550
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

317
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,440
<font color="yellow">I did come all the way out here,
but I feel a bit lost now.</font>

318
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,350
<font color="yellow">Maybe I should take this
chance and go to Seoul?</font>

319
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,850
<font color="yellow">Or maybe I should go to the East Sea
and enjoy the oceanside?</font>

320
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,940
<font color="yellow">You have nowhere else to go?</font>

321
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,350
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

322
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,920
<font color="yellow">And there's nobody
for you to meet up with?</font>

323
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,010
<font color="yellow">No, no one.</font>

324
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,050
<font color="yellow">What a hard life you have.</font>

325
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,440
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

326
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,350
<font color="yellow">It seems bad from the surface, but it's
actually a lot worse than you'd think.</font>

327
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,760
<font color="yellow">Can you not say things
like that so nonchalantly?</font>

328
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,930
<font color="yellow">It seems like you're
made of steel or something.</font>

329
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,940
<font color="yellow">Isn't it better to seem that way
than to seem pitiful?</font>

330
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,850
<font color="yellow">Well, if you're going
to Seoul, I'll drive you.</font>

331
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,650
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to the hospital?</font>

332
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,610
<font color="yellow">- I'm taking my monthly day off.
- Your monthly day off?</font>

333
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,150
<font color="yellow">His monthly day off?
Doctor Do In Bum is taking the day off?</font>

334
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's what he said.</font>

335
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,050
<font color="yellow">Then call Kang Dong Joo
and tell him to take over.</font>

336
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,240
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kang was on duty last night
so he's not working today.</font>

337
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
<font color="yellow">Call Teacher Kim, then!</font>

338
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,150
<font color="yellow">Did you forget?</font>

339
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,850
<font color="yellow">Teacher Kim was ordered to
be off duty as of today.</font>

340
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:37,650
<font color="yellow">Wait, then I'm the only general
surgeon at this hospital now?</font>

341
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,940
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

342
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,350
<font color="yellow">Looks like things ended up
this way somehow.</font>

343
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,940
<font color="yellow">Doctor Jung!
Please come here.</font>

344
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,240
<font color="yellow">- Ow, it hurts!
- Wait just a bit, ma'am.</font>

345
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,050
<font color="yellow">- Ow!
- Doctor, over here, too!</font>

346
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,130
<font color="yellow"><i>The caller you are trying

347
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,150
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung?
Hey, how would I know?</font>

348
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,350
<font color="yellow">I just saw her for the
first time in five years!</font>

349
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,350
<font color="yellow">Hey, Doctor Jung!</font>

350
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,850
<font color="yellow">Are you done treating the patient
with the right lower quadrant pain?</font>

351
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,850
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm busy with a patient.
Talk to you later!</font>

352
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,650
<font color="yellow">I'll check right now!</font>

353
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,150
<font color="yellow"><i>[ASSHOLE KANG]</i></font>

354

It's me, Kang Dong Joo.</i></font>

355
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,240
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. What do you want?</font>

356
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,150
<font color="yellow">You said that you knew
Senior Seo Jung from before, right?</font>

357
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,650
<font color="yellow"><i>I have to find her right now.</i></font>

358
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,150
<font color="yellow">Do you know where she might have gone?</font>

359
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,350
<font color="yellow">She's next to me right now.</font>

360
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,850
<font color="yellow">You're on speakerphone.
Say what you need to say.</font>

361
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,240
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

362
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,050
<font color="yellow">We're on our way to Seoul.</font>

363
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,050
<font color="yellow">Turn your car around right now
and come back to the hospital.</font>

364
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,740
<font color="yellow">That's going to be a bit difficult.
I'm already on the highway.</font>

365
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,050
<font color="yellow">Are you listening, Senior?</font>

366
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,740
<font color="yellow">I know it's hard for you right now.</font>

367
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,650
<font color="yellow">I know that, but... come on.
A letter of resignation?</font>

368
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,440
<font color="yellow">You wrote a letter of resignation?</font>

369
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,240
<font color="yellow">Turn the car around right now.
Come back, Senior.</font>

370
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Senior!</i></font>

371
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,740
<font color="yellow">Hey, why did you tell him
that I was with you?</font>

372
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,850
<font color="yellow">Well, you didn't tell me not to.</font>

373
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,240
<font color="yellow">And why did you tell him that
we're heading to Seoul?</font>

374
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,650
<font color="yellow">Well, he asked me where I was.</font>

375
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,240
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

376
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,440
<font color="yellow">Why did you write a
letter of resignation?</font>

377
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,940
<font color="yellow">None of your business.
Just drive properly.</font>

378
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,240
<font color="yellow">Wow, you sure are
coming on strong, Big Sis.</font>

379
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,150
<font color="yellow">I told you, I'm not your older sister!</font>

380
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,940
<font color="yellow">Seoul? Where in Seoul?</font>

381
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,150
<font color="yellow">I don't know the details.
I'm just following them there for now.</font>

382
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,240
<font color="yellow">Hey, aren't you a bit too tight on
time to drive to and from Seoul?</font>

383
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,000
<font color="yellow">But still, I have to do as much as I can.</font>

384
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,650
<font color="yellow">All right, then. But you know,
things are kind of crazy back here, too.</font>

385
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:58,350
<font color="yellow">We all forgot because of Director Do,
but today is Friday.</font>

386
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,440
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I told you to
bring a suture set and lidocaine here!</font>

387
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,150
<font color="yellow">It's been barely 10 seconds
since you asked me to do that.</font>

388
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,350
<font color="yellow">Ugh, seriously. I'm not someone
to be treating people like this!</font>

389
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,650
<font color="yellow">You should take off your necktie.</font>

390
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,940
<font color="yellow">You concern yourself with
doctors' neckties now, too?</font>

391
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,650
<font color="yellow">Nurse Park!</font>

392
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,050
<font color="yellow">Whoa, whoa! Are you okay?</font>

393
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,740
<font color="yellow">Please lie down.</font>

394
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,650
<font color="yellow">Do you think that it may
be something you ate, ma'am?</font>

395
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:31,350
<font color="yellow">I had cold rice and soup this morning.</font>

396
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,650
<font color="yellow">But I guess I ate it really fast.</font>

397
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,350
<font color="yellow">My insides are killing me.</font>

398
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,050
<font color="yellow">And you didn't have any diarrhea?</font>

399
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,350
<font color="yellow">My stomach is rumbling,
but I haven't had diarrhea yet.</font>

400
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,240
<font color="yellow">I just vomited a couple of times.</font>

401
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,440
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling pain anywhere else?</font>

402
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,350
<font color="yellow">My chest, a little.</font>

403
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,240
<font color="yellow">It may be due to esophageal
damage from vomiting a lot.</font>

404
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,150
<font color="yellow">It seems to be just stomach pain for now,
so we'll give you an injection.</font>

405
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,050
<font color="yellow">Give this patient some metoclopramide
via IV, and hydrate her.</font>

406
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

407
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,850
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I can do it.</font>

408
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,650
<font color="yellow">I'll get her cleaned up.
You hurry and give her the injection.</font>

409
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,940
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ms. Yeon Hwa.</font>

412
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,050
<font color="yellow">What? Oh, I thought there
was something on her neck.</font>

413
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,950
<font color="yellow">We have an emergency patient
who was in a traffic accident!</font>

414
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,850
<font color="yellow">She's bleeding from her right calf,
and her BP is 90/60.</font>

417

<font color="yellow">Yes. Yes, I understand.</font>

419
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,850

will be here in five minutes.</font>

420
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,550

told me not to.</font>

<font color="yellow">You do know that today is Friday, right?</font>

430
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,050

department is down here now.</font>

<font color="yellow">Those people are doctors, too.</font>

434
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,150
<font color="yellow">It's a patient who attempted suicide!
He fell off a bridge!</font>

435
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,650
<font color="yellow">Doctor! Please come over here!</font>

436
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,650
<font color="yellow">You call yourself a
board-certified ER doctor?</font>

437
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,150
<font color="yellow">Do your job properly!</font>

438
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,650
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Do you think that Doctor
Yoon Seo Jung will come back?</font>

439
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,850
<font color="yellow">Well, the groundwork has
been laid out already, but...</font>

440
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,740
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy!</font>

441
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,850
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel an endorphin rush
just from looking at this?</font>

442
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, hello there.</font>

443
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,150
<font color="yellow">Are you serious? You're
eating pizza with a fork and knife?</font>

444
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,240
<font color="yellow">Come on, you're being
rude to the pizza!</font>

445
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,440
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to hold
pizza in your hand, like this.</font>

446
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,950
<font color="yellow">And give it a big old bite!</font>

447
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,950
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

448
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,840
<font color="yellow">You're a mama's boy, aren't you?</font>

449
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,340
<font color="yellow">You've never just rolled in
the dirt to have a good time</font>

450
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,240
<font color="yellow">or disobeyed your parents, have you?</font>

451
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,950
<font color="yellow">My gosh, "disobedience"? What's that?
Is it something you can eat?</font>

452
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,240
<font color="yellow">Were you always this chatty?</font>

453
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,950
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

454
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,650
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

455
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,950
<font color="yellow">I tend to be more quiet and stoic.</font>

456
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,840
<font color="yellow">Who's the one who's been talking
all by herself for all this time, then?</font>

457
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,240
<font color="yellow">Well, that's because you
chose not to say anything.</font>

458
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,340
<font color="yellow">I didn't want there to be
an awkward silence.</font>

459
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,240
<font color="yellow">I'm just being considerate to you,
to help you avoid feeling awkward.</font>

460
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,650
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's not
because you feel uneasy?</font>

461
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,650
<font color="yellow">Um, why would I feel uneasy?</font>

462
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,340
<font color="yellow">Aren't you worried, now that you've left
after writing a resignation letter?</font>

463
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,240
<font color="yellow">And I bet that you're concerned
that Kang Dong Joo called, too.</font>

464
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,150
<font color="yellow">And the fact that you're here with
me now concerns you a bit too, right?</font>

465
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,950
<font color="yellow">And you're just saying anything that
comes to mind so I don't find out.</font>

466
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Let's eat.</font>

467
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,470
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm worried to death.</font>

468
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,950
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even say a proper farewell to
those people, who were like family to me</font>

469
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,660
<font color="yellow">and I feel so bad about running off
after just leaving a letter behind</font>

470
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,240
<font color="yellow">that I feel like I'll die.</font>

471
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,450
<font color="yellow">Why did I do that?</font>

472
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,840
<font color="yellow">I should've been more persistent
and begged him to spare me.</font>

473
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,650
<font color="yellow">Why did I go and write
that letter of resignation?</font>

474
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,950
<font color="yellow">I have nowhere to go
but Doldam Hospital.</font>

475
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:49,940
<font color="yellow">I... really have nowhere
else to go but there.</font>

476
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,650
<font color="yellow">So why did you get scared and run off?</font>

477
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,550
<font color="yellow">Nothing has been decided yet.</font>

478
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,650
<font color="yellow">It's not like that psychiatrist's report
has been released yet.</font>

479
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,340
<font color="yellow">And that patient undergoing TTM
hasn't died yet, either.</font>

480
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,840
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,950

487
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,340

00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Give the phone to Senior.</i></font>

489
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,150
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and give the phone to her!</font>

490
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I can't do that.</font>

491
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,550
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

492
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,840
<font color="yellow">She ran off while we were eating.</font>

493
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,650
<font color="yellow">She said she suddenly remembered
something that she had to do.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL]</i></font>

495
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,150
<font color="yellow">Hello, Doctor.</font>

496
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,740
<font color="yellow">What brings you all the way here?</font>

497
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,840
<font color="yellow">I came here because of the question
I couldn't answer for you before.</font>

498
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,650
<font color="yellow">You're a bit too late for that.</font>

499
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,050
<font color="yellow">I just sent my report to the Director.</font>

500
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,340
<font color="yellow">I've never had that though.</font>

501
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,150
<font color="yellow">I've never once thought
that I wanted to die.</font>

502
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,840
<font color="yellow">Not when my mom died.</font>

503
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,840
<font color="yellow">Not when I got into the
accident with Doctor Moon.</font>

504
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,050
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

505
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,340
<font color="yellow">wanted to live,
even through all that.</font>

506
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,240
<font color="yellow">That's why I was so miserable.</font>

507
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,340
<font color="yellow">Because my desire to live was stronger</font>

508
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,450
<font color="yellow">than the guilt I felt for being the
only one to have survived.</font>

509
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,840
<font color="yellow">Because, despite all that,
I wanted to live.</font>

510
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,150
<font color="yellow">And I felt so bad about feeling this way.</font>

511
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,450
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoon Seo Jung,
why did you become a doctor?</font>

512
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,550
<font color="yellow">Because I thought that,
if I became a doctor...</font>

513
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,050
<font color="yellow">I'd be able to have my existence
acknowledged by someone.</font>

514
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,950
<font color="yellow">Did you ever have a moment in which
you wanted to quit being a doctor?</font>

515
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,650
<font color="yellow">Many times.</font>

516
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,150
<font color="yellow">Every single time...</font>

517
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,050
<font color="yellow">I had to make a decision
for the sake of the patient.</font>

518
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,240
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

519
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:22,450
<font color="yellow">Could you give this to Teacher Kim
at Doldam Hospital?</font>

520
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,950
<font color="yellow">It's my report regarding your
mental health evaluation.</font>

521
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,340
<font color="yellow">I thought it'd be good for your
hospital to have a copy, too.</font>

522
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,950
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

523
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:55,150
<font color="yellow"><i>This patient's outburst
was due to stress from this past year.</i></font>

524
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:00,150
<font color="yellow"><i>She does not exhibit the DSM-5
defined symptoms related to PTSD.</i></font>

525
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,760
<font color="yellow"><i>Furthermore, there is no need
for her to be supervised closely.</i></font>

526
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,050
<font color="yellow">This bastard!</font>

527
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,050
<font color="yellow">I've handed my report over
to Doctor Yoon myself.</font>

528
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,870
<font color="yellow">Thankfully, I was able to hear the
answer that I wanted to hear from her.</font>

529
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,150
<font color="yellow">I almost did something
quite immoral as a doctor.</font>

530
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,150
<font color="yellow">Is Hyun Ji doing well?</font>

531
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,650
<font color="yellow">You still remember my child's name?</font>

532
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,050
<font color="yellow">Hey, of course I do.</font>

533
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,240
<font color="yellow">She was the youngest
patient that I'd ever had.</font>

534
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,050
<font color="yellow">You know, about Doldam Hospital...</font>

535
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,950
<font color="yellow">I think I understand why
you're remaining there, Senior.</font>

536
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Please do a proper evaluation of her.</i></font>

537
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:54,150
<font color="yellow">This is a life-and-death issue
for Senior Seo Jung, as a doctor.</font>

538
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,240
<font color="yellow">Please give her a proper evaluation,
despite what Director Do said.</font>

539
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,950
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoon is someone we
must have at Doldam Hospital's ER.</font>

540
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:08,050
<font color="yellow">Please don't screw her over
with a false evaluation.</font>

541
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,550
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

542
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,150
<font color="yellow">These are thank you letters that
Doctor Yoon's patients have given her.</font>

543
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,180
<font color="yellow">I thought you may want to refer
to them as you write your evaluation.</font>

544
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,240
<font color="yellow">We'll entrust our Doctor Yoon
to you, then, sir.</font>

545
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,240
<font color="yellow">If you write anything strange,
we'll file an appeal against you.</font>

546
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,130
<font color="yellow">Please don't do something to make you
ashamed to face her, doctor to doctor.</font>

547
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,340
<font color="yellow">Well, figures.</font>

548
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,240
<font color="yellow">They're all such strong-willed people.</font>

549
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,650
<font color="yellow">Don't lose to Director Do
this time, Senior.</font>

550
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,840
<font color="yellow">I'll be going, then.</font>

00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,550

554
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,050
<font color="yellow">I just received word, so I rushed here.</font>

555
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,450
<font color="yellow">What about you, Senior?</font>

556
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,630
<font color="yellow">Did you take care of
everything you needed to?</font>

557
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,550
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

558
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,950
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

559
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,740
<font color="yellow">Let's head back now.</font>

560
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,050
<font color="yellow">You're not coming?</font>

561
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,150
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

562
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,450
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

563
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,450
<font color="yellow">It's just so cold out here.</font>

564
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,950
<font color="yellow">You know how if you suddenly
walk into a bright or cold place...</font>

565
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,650
<font color="yellow">You know how it is. You tear up.</font>

566
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,050
<font color="yellow">It's just that, is all.</font>

567
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,650
<font color="yellow">Oh man, it's so cold!</font>

568
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,950
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

569
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,650
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

570
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,430
<font color="yellow">Is this the first snowfall of the season?</font>

571
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,150
<font color="yellow">It seems that way.</font>

572
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,650
<font color="yellow">It's pretty.</font>

573
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

574
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,840
<font color="yellow">Your hands are cold.</font>

575
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:50,050
<font color="yellow">I'll hold your hand
just until it warms up.</font>

576
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,050
<font color="yellow">That's okay with you, right?</font>

577
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,050
