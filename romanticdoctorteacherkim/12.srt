<font color="yellow">you were keen to take 15-percent increase in salary...</font>

00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:58,581
<font color="yellow">does that make you go up that ladder?</font>

253
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:01,421
<font color="yellow">You are hiding under President Do...</font>

254
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:03,751
<font color="yellow">and giving him your loyalty.</font>

255

00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,451
<font color="yellow">If I don't make it...</font>

262
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:30,551
<font color="yellow">into the mainstream, I become a nobody.</font>

263
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:33,651
<font color="yellow">Is that why you want to abandon your pride...</font>

264
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,651
<font color="yellow">and your conscience?</font>

265

<font color="yellow">If you live as a nobody,</font>

268
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:45,751
<font color="yellow">does that keep your pride?</font>

269
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,081
<font color="yellow">If you have no power,</font>

270
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:54,351
<font color="yellow">how can you keep your conscience?</font>

271
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:04,481
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much it hurts to be humiliated...</font>

272
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,921
<font color="yellow">because you have no power and no money?</font>

273
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:11,691
<font color="yellow">Do you know?</font>

274
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:14,751
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

318
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:04,751
<font color="yellow">This is Dr. Kang's mother.</font>

319
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:14,951
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm glad to meet you.</font>

320
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:21,451
<font color="yellow">She is Dr. Yoon Seo Jung of Emergency Medicine.</font>

321
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:22,681
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

322
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:24,481
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

323
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:38,751
<font color="yellow">I guess Dong Joo lives here, right?</font>

324
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:41,551
<font color="yellow">Yes. We have a company house around here,</font>

325
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,881
<font color="yellow">but Dong Joo...</font>

326
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:46,021
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang feels...</font>

327
00:23:46,751 --> 00:23:49,421
<font color="yellow">more comfortable in this staff room.</font>

328
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:53,351
<font color="yellow">As you know, Dong Joo is... Gosh.</font>

329
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:55,221
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang...</font>

330
00:23:56,121 --> 00:24:00,251
<font color="yellow">gets very stubborn once he decides to be.</font>

331
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:01,551
<font color="yellow">Tell me about it.</font>

332
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:03,521
<font color="yellow">He is just like his father.</font>

333
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:08,081
<font color="yellow">But at the same time, I think...</font>

334
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,651
<font color="yellow">he could study so hard because of his stubborn streak.</font>

335
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,751
<font color="yellow">You are right. I think so.</font>

336
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:17,651
<font color="yellow">Would you like to have something to drink?</font>

337
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:28,581
<font color="yellow">You don't need to feel so nervous and uncomfortable around me.</font>

338
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:31,951
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

339
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:37,021
<font color="yellow">Let's just have one more round.</font>

340
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:40,921
<font color="yellow">Let's go to a karaoke room. It's on me.</font>

341
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:43,051
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

342
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,281
<font color="yellow">- Dong Joo. - It's on me.</font>

343
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:46,951
<font color="yellow">Why did you drink so much?</font>

344
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:49,551
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang Dong Joo.</font>

345
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,651
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

346
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:52,851
<font color="yellow">It's Seo Jung.</font>

347
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:58,581
<font color="yellow">You are here, my precious Seo Jung.</font>

348
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,021
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get off me.</font>

349
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:05,351
<font color="yellow">Get off.</font>

350
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:09,681
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Why are you doing this to me?</font>

351
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:12,651
<font color="yellow">Your mother is here. Get off me.</font>

352
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:25,681
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

353
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:28,351
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

354
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:32,151
<font color="yellow">how much I like you?</font>

355
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,581
<font color="yellow">Hey. Pull yourself together.</font>

356
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:41,851
<font color="yellow">I told you to let go of me.</font>

357
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,021
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear me?</font>

358
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:46,751
<font color="yellow">I said...</font>

359
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:51,021
<font color="yellow">I like you a lot.</font>

360
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:53,621
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

361
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:07,321
<font color="yellow">Get off of me!</font>

362
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,221
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo.</font>

363
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,921
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo, are you okay?</font>

364
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:17,221
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ma'am.</font>

365
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:20,821
<font color="yellow">Hey, Dong Joo. Are you all right?</font>

366
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:22,051
<font color="yellow">Hey, Dong Joo.</font>

367
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,181
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

368
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,721
<font color="yellow">Well... Where is Dr. Kang?</font>

369
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:53,851
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Dr. Yoon?</font>

370
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:55,681
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

371
00:26:56,021 --> 00:27:01,221
<font color="yellow">I just want to sink deep under my feet.</font>

372

391
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:04,281

00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,581
<font color="yellow">What do you mean the operation has been postponed?</font>

444
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:37,821
<font color="yellow">Is there something wrong with my dad?</font>

445

<font color="yellow">We'll have to wait and see for a few more days...</font>

446
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:42,121
<font color="yellow">and decide on the date of the operation again.</font>

451
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:57,151
<font color="yellow">Did he pass away?</font>

00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,751
<font color="yellow">Yes. He died.</font>

453
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,051
<font color="yellow">After you postponed his operation,</font>

454
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:07,181
<font color="yellow">they kept changing his doctor and the operation kept being postponed.</font>

455
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:10,951
<font color="yellow">After that, he passed away from acute sepsis.</font>

456

<font color="yellow">Why did you postpone the operation?</font>

457

<font color="yellow">His operation was scheduled first.</font>

458
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:25,451
<font color="yellow">Is it because the other man was a VIP...</font>

459
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,721
<font color="yellow">and my dad was a nobody?</font>

460

<font color="yellow">How can you...</font>

461
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:35,751
<font color="yellow">You can't be discriminate with people's lives at stake.</font>

462
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,181
<font color="yellow">Do you call yourself a doctor?</font>

463
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,821
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to be like that.</font>

464
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:43,281
<font color="yellow">How can you play with people's lives?</font>

465
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,321
<font color="yellow">Doctors aren't supposed to be like that.</font>

466

00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:56,551
<font color="yellow">here before that person.</font>

471
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:58,581
<font color="yellow">You have to treat my dad first.</font>

472
00:34:07,351 --> 00:34:08,751
<font color="yellow">I will never forgive you.</font>

473

475

479

<font color="yellow">Don't let it get you down.</font>

480
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,851
<font color="yellow">I'll contact the police and sort this mess out.</font>

481
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,181
<font color="yellow">You don't need to worry at all.</font>

482
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:09,091
<font color="yellow">No. Don't help him with that.</font>

483
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:12,621
<font color="yellow">Let's just see how things pan out.</font>

484
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:13,981
<font color="yellow">But Master Kim...</font>

<font color="yellow">For now,</font>

490
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:30,381

493
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:39,821

497
00:35:47,151 --> 00:35:49,421

500
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:01,181

501

503
00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:10,351

519
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:07,181
<font color="yellow">I have to think things through.</font>

520
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:08,421
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

521
00:37:09,821 --> 00:37:12,221
<font color="yellow">It's a medical certificate of death. There's no need to think.</font>

522
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:13,821
<font color="yellow">You just need to put down the facts.</font>

523

<font color="yellow">It's not that the truth is always right.</font>

528
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,321

530
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,751

531
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:42,251
<font color="yellow">You're just the doctor who operated on the patient.</font>

532
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,921

00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:33,681
<font color="yellow">until I am completely decided.</font>

786
00:57:33,981 --> 00:57:35,051
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

787
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:39,851
<font color="yellow">I hope Dr. Yoon gets a chance this time.</font>

788
00:57:41,321 --> 00:57:42,351
<font color="yellow">It's just...</font>

789
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:44,481
<font color="yellow">my wish, though.</font>

790
00:57:45,081 --> 00:57:46,681
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, Ms. Oh.</font>

791
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:51,921
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

792
00:57:58,381 --> 00:58:00,681
<font color="yellow">Why? What is it? Tell me.</font>

793
00:58:05,421 --> 00:58:06,581
<font color="yellow">It's about...</font>

794
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:08,821
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin's operation.</font>

795
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:12,151
<font color="yellow">It's not much of an operation.</font>

796
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:14,721
<font color="yellow">We're just changing the batteries of his artificial heart.</font>

797
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:15,921
<font color="yellow">May I be...</font>

798
00:58:16,681 --> 00:58:18,881
<font color="yellow">the first assistant?</font>

799
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,921
<font color="yellow">Why? You're a general surgeon.</font>

800
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:28,281
<font color="yellow">When I was an intern,</font>

801
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:30,821
<font color="yellow">I have participated in heart transplant operation once.</font>

802
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:32,721
<font color="yellow">I've also been...</font>

803
00:58:33,081 --> 00:58:34,581
<font color="yellow">in aortic dissection once,</font>

804
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:36,581
<font color="yellow">four times at cardiovascular bypass operation,</font>

805
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:37,951
<font color="yellow">ECMO operation once,</font>

806
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:40,821
<font color="yellow">and VAD operation twice.</font>

807
00:58:40,921 --> 00:58:43,021
<font color="yellow">If you take the first assistant,</font>

808
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,351
<font color="yellow">that will push back Dr. Yoon.</font>

809
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,581
<font color="yellow">Do you understand that?</font>

810
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:49,381
<font color="yellow">Is there...</font>

811
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:51,381
<font color="yellow">any way I can participate?</font>

812
00:59:00,421 --> 00:59:02,021
<font color="yellow">Don't you look forward to this?</font>

813
00:59:04,551 --> 00:59:05,621
<font color="yellow">Who will become...</font>

814
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:07,921
<font color="yellow">a part of Master Kim's operation?</font>

815
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:10,581
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

816
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:12,851
<font color="yellow">Whoever that may be,</font>

817
00:59:13,521 --> 00:59:15,681
<font color="yellow">he or she is very lucky.</font>

818
