5
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:56,636
<font color="yellow">You fractured your right ankle,
so I put a cast on it for you.</font>

6
00:00:56,636 --> 00:00:58,736
<font color="yellow">It'll be good as new
in two to three months.</font>

7
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:04,236
<font color="yellow">The problem, though,
is with your wrist.</font>

8
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:08,036
<font color="yellow">The fracture on your
right palm is quite severe.</font>

9
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,936
<font color="yellow">I did put some pins in there via surgery</font>

10
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,436

more than a 70 percent recovery.</font>

11
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:22,635

12
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:26,335

13
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:29,436
<font color="yellow">I was a fourth-year
resident working at an ER.</font>

14

<font color="yellow">Your recovery may vary...</font>

15
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:40,436
<font color="yellow">but in the worst-case scenario,
you won't be able to go back to work.</font>

- Thank you!</font>

18

<font color="yellow">Two orders of dumplings here, please.</font>

19
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:26,336
<font color="yellow">Why don't you head home
and eat rice instead?</font>

20
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,536
<font color="yellow">I came here because
I was craving dumplings.</font>

21
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:31,836
<font color="yellow">Don't they even feed you
at that hospital?</font>

22
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:33,735
<font color="yellow">How is it that you look so malnourished?</font>

23
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:36,336
<font color="yellow">I'm eating properly.</font>

24
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:39,367
<font color="yellow">It's just that my schedule is
unconventional since I work at the ER.</font>

25
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,735
<font color="yellow">So why did you insist on being a doctor?</font>

26
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:46,336
<font color="yellow">It's not like your dead father will
come back to life because you do that.</font>

27
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:51,436

your father died at, of all places.</font>

30

<font color="yellow">Or two, save some super-level
VIP from the brink of death.</font>

62
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:52,536
<font color="yellow">There's no way they'd assign
a VIP as my patient.</font>

63

The hospital director is looking for you.</font>

69
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,336
<font color="yellow">Go to his office.</font>

70
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,636
<font color="yellow">We just scheduled an
emergency surgery for a VIP.</font>

71
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:19,713
<font color="yellow">It's Assemblyman Go Man Suk, the former
Speaker of the National Assembly--</font>

72
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:24,309
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I already have an
operation scheduled for today, sir.</font>

73
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:26,836
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop being so difficult!</font>

74
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:29,536
<font color="yellow">You should take care of
rearranging your own schedule!</font>

75
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:32,536
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what it means to
have a VIP patient entrusted to you?</font>

76
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:35,235
<font color="yellow">He must be a real piece of work, then.</font>

77
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:40,935
<font color="yellow">And you probably need someone to
take the fall if the surgery goes awry.</font>

78
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:44,077
<font color="yellow">And I seemed to be the easiest person
to take advantage of among everyone.</font>

79

<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

80
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:47,636
<font color="yellow">Look here, Doctor Kang Dong Joo!</font>

81
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,735
<font color="yellow">I'm going to operate on my
original patient first.</font>

82
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:54,136
<font color="yellow">He's a sepsis patient so he could be
in danger if we push back the operation.</font>

83
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:55,536
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

84
00:05:55,536 --> 00:05:56,836
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

85
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,536
<font color="yellow">Why did you become a doctor?</font>

86
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:09,935
<font color="yellow">The fact that you studied like crazy
means that you wanted to be successful.</font>

87
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,536
<font color="yellow">So you should take
the opportunities offered to you.</font>

88
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:20,836
<font color="yellow">You're the one who came to the ER
once and went on a rampage, right?</font>

89
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:27,435
<font color="yellow">Yeah. This patient is quite a
difficult case, just as you said.</font>

90
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,735
<font color="yellow">He had a HCC rupture</font>

91
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:33,235
<font color="yellow">so there's only a 30 percent chance
that your surgery will be successful.</font>

92
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:38,336
<font color="yellow">But you need to take on that much risk
if you want to grab this opportunity.</font>

93
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:44,735
<font color="yellow">You're not standing here,
wanting to face off against me</font>

94
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,935
<font color="yellow">without even risking
that little, are you?</font>

95
00:06:49,336 --> 00:06:50,536
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

96

97
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:08,735
<font color="yellow">What do you mean,
push back the surgery?</font>

98
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,935
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem with
my father, by any chance?</font>

99

my skills, no matter what.</i></font>

100

<font color="yellow">I'll monitor his progress for a few more
days before scheduling his surgery again.</font>

101
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:24,836
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

102
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:27,235
<font color="yellow">Doctor!</font>

103
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:31,935

<font color="yellow">That's why your knives
get dull so easily.</font>

237

I'm a general surgeon.</font>

296
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,999
<font color="yellow">Why didn't they send me an
internal medicine specialist</font>

297
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:32,036
<font color="yellow">if they were going to send someone?</font>

298
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:33,736

particular issues with you, Doctor Kang.</font>

for our surgical department</font>

surgical specialist, too.</font>

hospital with all the bells and whistles.</font>

a surgical department, family physicians</font>

You don't need to worry about me.</font>

313

staying here too long.</font>

00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:29,936

much bigger hospital in Seoul.</font>

tell you this now rather than later.</font>

what you're saying.</font>

for our hospital or something?</font>

321
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:47,736

to last a week here.</font>

322
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:51,036
<font color="yellow">He has a good look about him,

386

<font color="yellow">Why are you using formal speech
with me all of the sudden? It's weird.</font>

387
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,816
<font color="yellow">You want a resident to talk informally
to you, though you're a specialist?</font>

388
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,229
<font color="yellow">I'll do that, then,
if that's okay with you.</font>

you've worked at the ER for five years?</font>

391

Doctor Kang Dong Joo?</font>

394
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:42,735
<font color="yellow">He already has severe muscle guarding.</font>

395
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,936
<font color="yellow">This means that he has
severe internal hemorrhaging.</font>

396
00:34:44,936 --> 00:34:48,235
<font color="yellow">It'd be best for us to put a chest tube
in and move him to a bigger hospital.</font>

397
00:34:48,235 --> 00:34:50,427
<font color="yellow">There's a limit to what we can do
at this tiny hospital, after all.</font>

398
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:52,735
<font color="yellow">If you need an ultrasound machine,
we have one here, too.</font>

399
00:34:57,735 --> 00:35:00,836
<font color="yellow">Our hospital has pretty much everything,
despite our appearance.</font>

400
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:25,572
<font color="yellow">So he does have severe internal
hemorrhaging from his spleen.</font>

401
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:26,684
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

402
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:29,164
<font color="yellow">I think the hemorrhaging
is more severe than we thought.</font>

403
00:35:29,164 --> 00:35:31,713
<font color="yellow">- What should we do?
- What do you mean?</font>

404
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,135
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't delay any longer
and get him to a bigger hospital.</font>

405
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:36,235
<font color="yellow">How far is the nearest large hospital?</font>

406
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:40,536
<font color="yellow">Two hours, by car. Or one hour and
30 minutes, if you really floor it.</font>

407
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:43,936
<font color="yellow">He'll probably die due to an excessive
loss of blood on his way there.</font>

408
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:45,438
<font color="yellow">Let's just treat him here.</font>

409
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:47,941
<font color="yellow">This isn't an injury that can be
treated at a hospital of this caliber!</font>

410
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:48,970
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell?</font>

411
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,293
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that's not your
lack of confidence talking?</font>

412
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:53,117
<font color="yellow">Even if I'm a doctor,
cutting open his stomach</font>

413
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,619
<font color="yellow">in an under-equipped hospital like this
is pretty much attempted murder!</font>

414
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,836
<font color="yellow">It's not that I can't.
I just won't!</font>

415
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,936
<font color="yellow">Hey, keep it down!</font>

416
00:36:26,036 --> 00:36:27,036
<font color="yellow">Vitals?</font>

417
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:29,036

Heart rate is 128.</font>

418
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:31,135

in his lower abdomen.</font>

419
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:34,235
<font color="yellow">We don't know his identity
nor the reason for his injuries.</font>

420
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:37,738
<font color="yellow">He drove himself here and crashed
into another car in our parking lot.</font>

421
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:39,443
<font color="yellow">His car is totaled, too.</font>

422
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:42,235
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing around?
Get back to doing what you were doing.</font>

423
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:43,836
<font color="yellow">Oh... yes, sir.</font>

424
00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:49,700
<font color="yellow">Perform an intubation first.
Hook him up on a ventilator</font>

425
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,735
<font color="yellow">and make preparations
for performing a ligation.</font>

426
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:55,135
<font color="yellow">You're not planning to try and stop
his hemorrhaging here, are you?</font>

427
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:57,036
<font color="yellow">All right, 20 miligrams of that.</font>

428
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:08,936
<font color="yellow"><i>They're fast.</i></font>

429
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:12,936
<font color="yellow">Put a propofol continuous infusion in him
and get some some rocuronium, too.</font>

430
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:13,936
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

431
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,135
<font color="yellow">Put the ventilator on CMV mode.</font>

432
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:21,536
<font color="yellow">Pass me the tube.</font>

433
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,536
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't waste time.
Just use the trocar!</font>

434
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,653
<font color="yellow">Pass me the trocar, please.</font>

435
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:27,836
<font color="yellow"><i>A trocar?
They have that here?</i></font>

436
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:40,536
<font color="yellow">How many cc's of blood
do we have now?</font>

437
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:43,135
<font color="yellow">400 cc's now, and we've still
got more coming out, sir.</font>

438
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,235
<font color="yellow">Okay. My turn now.</font>

439
00:37:45,235 --> 00:37:47,135
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey!</font>

440
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:48,536
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

441
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:51,427
<font color="yellow">If you're not going to do it yourself,
hurry up and move out of the way.</font>

442
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:54,936
<font color="yellow">You're going to cut open
a patient's stomach here?</font>

443
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:57,454
<font color="yellow">This isn't an OR or even a hybrid room!</font>

444
00:37:57,454 --> 00:37:58,836
<font color="yellow">It's not sterile enough here--</font>

445
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:01,735
<font color="yellow">Hey, Nurse Park.
Get this thing out of my face.</font>

446
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:05,336
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?
"Get this thing out of my face"?</font>

447
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:06,990
<font color="yellow">What kind of...</font>

448
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,735
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! Let go!</font>

449
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:12,036
<font color="yellow">- Scalpel.
- Stop that right now.</font>

450
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:14,936
<font color="yellow">Are all of you people crazy?</font>

451
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:16,833
<font color="yellow">There will be lots of blood, so be ready.</font>

452
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,936
<font color="yellow">Are you even a real doctor?</font>

453
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,536
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

454
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,735
<font color="yellow">All right. Suction.</font>

455
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:38,135
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

456
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:45,836
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. I found it.</font>

457
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:48,235
<font color="yellow"><i>He found it already?</i></font>

458
00:38:48,235 --> 00:38:49,735
<font color="yellow">All right. Hemostat, please.</font>

459
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:57,536
<font color="yellow">Hold on to this.</font>

460
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,135
<font color="yellow">Surgical string number three.</font>

461
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:20,036
<font color="yellow">All right, focus.</font>

462
00:39:42,536 --> 00:39:45,936
<font color="yellow"><i>What's with those hands of his?</i></font>

463
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:07,436
<font color="yellow"><i>What am I seeing here?</i></font>

464
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:12,343
<font color="yellow">All right. Cover it up with film for now.</font>

465
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,735
<font color="yellow">Move him to the operating room.</font>

466
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:16,735
<font color="yellow">Finish treating his
splenorrhagia there, okay?</font>

467
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:18,336
<font color="yellow">- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</font>

468
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:23,735
<font color="yellow"><i>Who is this man?</i></font>

469
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:26,336
<font color="yellow">What, you have a problem
with my work or something?</font>

470
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:32,836
<font color="yellow">That was reckless,
irresponsible, and dangerous.</font>

471
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:34,135
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

472
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:37,036
<font color="yellow">Well, clearly this situation
left us with no other choice</font>

473
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:38,851
<font color="yellow">since the patient's life was in danger.</font>

474
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:41,599
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll still be okay later</font>

475
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,885
<font color="yellow">after you tell the patient
how he was treated just now?</font>

476
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:48,034
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about patients' rights
that doctors are to respect?</font>

477
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,936
<font color="yellow">Don't argue about things
like that with me.</font>

478
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:55,336
<font color="yellow">I only care about one thing.
Saving the patient!</font>

479
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:57,936
<font color="yellow">Saving the patient, no matter what.</font>

480
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:03,536
<font color="yellow">And screw everything else.</font>

481
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:16,036
<font color="yellow">Prepare 10 packs of RBC and
8 packs of fresh frozen plasma, please.</font>

482
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:17,836
<font color="yellow">I'll go and prepare
the operating room.</font>

483
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:37,336
<font color="yellow"><i>Just what is this place, exactly?</i></font>

484
00:41:37,336 --> 00:41:39,135
<font color="yellow"><i>[Surgery in progress]</i></font>

485
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,135
<font color="yellow">You're not heading in?</font>

486
00:41:52,336 --> 00:41:55,536
<font color="yellow">I can't. I'm forbidden to.</font>

487
00:41:57,235 --> 00:41:59,735
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you oppose it back there?</font>

488
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:06,036
<font color="yellow">Cutting someone's abdomen open
in an ER is utterly ridiculous behavior.</font>

489
00:42:06,036 --> 00:42:09,735
<font color="yellow">And it was totally unsafe
for the patient to undergo that.</font>

490
00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:14,034
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

491
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:17,340
<font color="yellow">You pushed back your own patient's
surgery to perform surgery on a VIP</font>

492
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,251
<font color="yellow">who ended up dying
on the operating table.</font>

493
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:22,836
<font color="yellow">You were sent here because you tried
to gain recognition but were blindsided.</font>

494
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,836
<font color="yellow">Is that kind of surgery
okay to perform, then?</font>

495
00:42:28,536 --> 00:42:32,427
<font color="yellow">Do you keep in touch
with Senior In Soo?</font>

496
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,936
<font color="yellow">I heard from one of the department heads.</font>

497
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:38,735
<font color="yellow">Looks like they heard pretty much your
entire history from someone they know.</font>

498
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:41,836
<font color="yellow">It couldn't be helped.</font>

499
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:47,036
<font color="yellow">If I didn't take on that risk,
I would've lost my chance.</font>

500
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:49,735
<font color="yellow">What chance?</font>

501
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:52,836
<font color="yellow">A chance to prove my skills.</font>

502
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,135
<font color="yellow">To whom?</font>

503
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:56,253
<font color="yellow">Are you really asking me that,
as if you don't know?</font>

504
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:58,336
<font color="yellow">The higher-ups who were
watching me, obviously.</font>

505
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:00,635
<font color="yellow">Everything there depends on
connections. Don't you know that?</font>

506
00:43:00,635 --> 00:43:04,333
<font color="yellow">People like me who have to hit the ground
running need to do anything we can.</font>

507
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:08,735
<font color="yellow">We have to side with the right people or
save a VIP patient to gain recognition!</font>

508
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:18,235
<font color="yellow">What happened to you
in the past five years?</font>

509
00:43:18,936 --> 00:43:21,936
<font color="yellow">You've become such a coward,
full of excuses.</font>

510
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:25,325
<font color="yellow">Why did you change so much?</font>

511
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:31,735
<font color="yellow">Was it that hard to get by?</font>

512
00:43:35,536 --> 00:43:38,836
<font color="yellow">You said you'd be here a month,
but no longer than two months?</font>

513
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:43,536
<font color="yellow">Do your best, even though I'm
not sure you'll be able to last here.</font>

514
00:44:05,635 --> 00:44:07,235
<font color="yellow">I like you, Senior.</font>

515
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,036
<font color="yellow">This is your last year
as a resident, right?</font>

516
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:22,182
<font color="yellow">Let's get married as soon
as your residency is over.</font>

517
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:24,936
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

518
00:44:50,336 --> 00:44:52,735
<font color="yellow">You think you can hide your
feelings just by doing that?</font>

519
00:44:57,135 --> 00:45:02,958
<font color="yellow"><i>What, is your heart beating fast
now that you've run into him again?</i></font>

520
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:04,735
<font color="yellow">This is just an illusion.</font>

521
00:45:05,735 --> 00:45:07,436
<font color="yellow">This is just an illusion.</font>

522
00:45:08,235 --> 00:45:09,536
<font color="yellow">This is just an illusion.</font>

523
00:45:10,036 --> 00:45:11,735
<font color="yellow">This is just an illusion.</font>

524
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:44,536
<font color="yellow">I want to speak to you for a second.</font>

525
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:47,336
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm tired, kid.
Save it for later.</font>

526
00:46:16,536 --> 00:46:22,036
<font color="yellow">Madonna definitely
sounds best on a casette player.</font>

527
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:33,936
<font color="yellow">I told you that I wanted
to speak with you.</font>

528
00:46:34,936 --> 00:46:39,135
<font color="yellow">A patient's rights,
a doctor's integrity...</font>

529
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:41,235
<font color="yellow">you may not care
about any of that, but--</font>

530
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:44,635
<font color="yellow">How many people did you kill
before you ended up here?</font>

531
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,836
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about
when you were a resident.</font>

532
00:46:48,836 --> 00:46:53,235
<font color="yellow">How many patients died under your
knife after you got your specialization?</font>

533
00:46:54,036 --> 00:46:57,836
<font color="yellow">One person. Right before I came here.</font>

534
00:46:57,836 --> 00:47:01,036
<font color="yellow">Now add 10 to that.</font>

535
00:47:01,536 --> 00:47:05,635
<font color="yellow">Kill that many more people
before you come mouthing off to me.</font>

536
00:47:06,135 --> 00:47:09,936
<font color="yellow">I'll hear you out then.</font>

537
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:20,235
<font color="yellow">Oh, yeah. You still have my
right hand on you there, right?</font>

538
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:25,235
<font color="yellow">Take good care of it, because
I'll come for it when I need it.</font>

539
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:34,336
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I'm not staying here long.</font>

540
00:47:34,336 --> 00:47:40,336
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave this wretched place
in a month, or even sooner if I can!</font>

541
00:47:40,336 --> 00:47:44,135
<font color="yellow">And do you even have a place that'll
take you, if not this wretched hospital?</font>

542
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:46,936
<font color="yellow">I'll go back to where I came from.</font>

543
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:54,735
<font color="yellow">Did they say that
they'd even take you back?</font>

544
00:47:56,135 --> 00:48:00,945
<font color="yellow">I didn't get sent away to a place
like this because I lack skill.</font>

545
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:02,235
<font color="yellow">I just got really unlucky!</font>

546
00:48:02,235 --> 00:48:04,836
<font color="yellow">I didn't study hard, do practicals,
and perform all those dissections</font>

547
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:08,235
<font color="yellow">while pulling all-nighters all the time
just so I could be stuck</font>

548
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:11,536
<font color="yellow">in some crappy hospital in the
boonies for the rest of my life!</font>

549
00:48:11,536 --> 00:48:15,235
<font color="yellow">Yeah, yeah.
So what's your point?</font>

550
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:20,836
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go back there
by any means necessary.</font>

551
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:53,336
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kang Dong Joo?</font>

552
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:55,836
<font color="yellow">A call for you, from Seoul.</font>

553
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:57,536
<font color="yellow">She says she's your mother.</font>

554
00:48:57,536 --> 00:48:59,967
<font color="yellow">She said she kept calling your cell
but you wouldn't pick up</font>

555
00:48:59,967 --> 00:49:01,836
<font color="yellow">so she decided to call the hospital.</font>

556
00:49:05,635 --> 00:49:06,836
<font color="yellow"><i>[Senior In Soo]</i></font>

557
00:49:10,036 --> 00:49:11,336

<font color="yellow">Tell her that I'm busy,
and that I'll call her later.</font>

559
00:49:15,735 --> 00:49:17,536
<font color="yellow">Yes, Senior? It's me.</font>

560
00:49:18,536 --> 00:49:20,590
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kang's mother?
Yes, hello.</font>

561
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,445
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kang is busy right now.</font>

562
00:49:22,445 --> 00:49:25,135
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? All right.</font>

563
00:49:25,135 --> 00:49:27,135
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being a nuisance.</font>

564
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:36,135
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

565
00:49:36,135 --> 00:49:39,545
<font color="yellow">Director Do and Director Yeo are friends?</font>

566
00:49:39,545 --> 00:49:40,735
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

567
00:49:41,235 --> 00:49:44,267
<font color="yellow">Director Do Yoon Wan here
and Director Yeo from there</font>

568
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:46,711
<font color="yellow">have been best friends since college!</font>

569
00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:48,735
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

570
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:52,436
<font color="yellow">You did greet Director Yeo properly
as soon as you got there, right?</font>

571
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:58,990
<font color="yellow">You have to make a good impression
on Director Yeo, no matter what.</font>

572
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,834
<font color="yellow">If you want to change Director Do's mind,
you have to make Director Yeo like you.</font>

573
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,278
<font color="yellow">You get what I'm saying, right?</font>

574
00:50:04,278 --> 00:50:08,436
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, I also managed to hear
this info from someone I know.</i></font>

575
00:50:08,436 --> 00:50:11,751
<font color="yellow">Apparently, Director Yeo
really loves Baduk.</font>

576
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:16,235
<font color="yellow">And also, he loves oriental orchids.</font>

577
00:50:16,235 --> 00:50:23,135
<font color="yellow">Senior. I'm terrible at Baduk
and I know nothing about plants.</font>

578
00:50:23,135 --> 00:50:24,536
<font color="yellow">Ugh, you're so frustrating!</font>

579
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:27,036
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be stuck at
Doldam Hospital forever?</font>

580
00:50:34,036 --> 00:50:35,735
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

581
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:37,536
<font color="yellow">Um, well...</font>

582
00:50:45,235 --> 00:50:48,394
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Just tell me what you need.</font>

583
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:51,726
<font color="yellow">I was way out of line this morning</font>

584
00:50:51,726 --> 00:50:54,336
<font color="yellow">so I feel like I didn't
properly greet you.</font>

585
00:50:54,936 --> 00:51:00,336
<font color="yellow">I'd like it if you could forgive me
if I offended you in any way, Director.</font>

586
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:08,836
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.
You didn't really offend me.</font>

587
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:10,635
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

588
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:17,836
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes! I did hear that you
met Teacher Kim, though.</font>

589
00:51:17,836 --> 00:51:19,936
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Teacher Kim?</font>

590
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:21,735
<font color="yellow">You know, the Chief of the
Surgical Department.</font>

591
00:51:21,735 --> 00:51:25,536
<font color="yellow">Oh... is that how people refer to him?</font>

592
00:51:26,235 --> 00:51:30,135
<font color="yellow">He may not make a good first impression,
but there's a lot to learn from him.</font>

593
00:51:30,135 --> 00:51:32,436
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't know about that.</font>

594
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:36,836
<font color="yellow">Be polite, no matter what, so that
he gets a good impression of you!</font>

595
00:51:36,836 --> 00:51:38,036
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>

596
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:41,135
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir. I'll do my best.</font>

597
00:51:41,836 --> 00:51:44,086
<font color="yellow">All right, then.
You can go now.</font>

598
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:45,135
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

599
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:50,157
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

600
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:52,735
<font color="yellow">Was there something else you
wanted to discuss, too?</font>

601
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,536
<font color="yellow">Well, um, to be honest...</font>

602
00:51:54,536 --> 00:51:55,936
<font color="yellow">Director!</font>

603
00:51:55,936 --> 00:51:57,936
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoon Seo Jung
is having an epiosde again!</font>

604
00:51:57,936 --> 00:51:59,436
<font color="yellow">Again?</font>

605
00:51:59,436 --> 00:52:02,536
<font color="yellow">- Hurry and let Teacher Kim know!
- Yes, sir.</font>

606
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:15,693
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

607
00:52:17,836 --> 00:52:19,536
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoon?</font>

608
00:52:20,635 --> 00:52:22,436
<font color="yellow">Put that down, right now.</font>

609
00:52:29,336 --> 00:52:31,235
<font color="yellow">It's best to stay back.</font>

610
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:33,135
<font color="yellow">Trust Nurse Oh.</font>

611
00:52:33,135 --> 00:52:35,135
<font color="yellow">You've been doing so well up until now.</font>

612
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:39,036
<font color="yellow">You'll be able to re-enter the
surgical room in a few days, too.</font>

613
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:40,735
<font color="yellow"><i>I died because of you.</i></font>

614
00:52:40,735 --> 00:52:43,028
<font color="yellow">The voices won't stop!</font>

615
00:52:43,028 --> 00:52:45,536
<font color="yellow">It's because you think
that you can still hear them.</font>

616
00:52:45,536 --> 00:52:49,146
<font color="yellow">You've made a full recovery now,
Doctor Yoon, and you're fine now.</font>

617
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:52,536
<font color="yellow">So, here. Give that back to me.</font>

618
00:52:55,735 --> 00:52:59,536
<font color="yellow">Give me the scalpel.</font>

619
00:53:01,536 --> 00:53:03,235
<font color="yellow">Help me.</font>

620
00:53:06,336 --> 00:53:08,235
<font color="yellow">Please, help me.</font>

621
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:13,336
<font color="yellow"><i>I died because of you.</i></font>

622
00:53:13,336 --> 00:53:14,635
<font color="yellow">Senior...</font>

623
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:16,536
<font color="yellow">Stay back!</font>

624
00:53:19,036 --> 00:53:22,735
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? What's going on?</font>

625
00:53:24,135 --> 00:53:26,536
<font color="yellow">Why are you holding a scalpel?
That's dangerous!</font>

626
00:53:28,635 --> 00:53:30,135
<font color="yellow">I like you, Senior.</font>

627
00:53:41,436 --> 00:53:43,036
<font color="yellow">Give it here.</font>

628
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:47,536
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

629
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:51,635
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

630
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:54,336
<font color="yellow">No. No, Senior!</font>

631
00:54:03,235 --> 00:54:05,135
<font color="yellow">Get some gauze, now!</font>

632
00:54:20,936 --> 00:54:22,735
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

633
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:53,536
<font color="yellow">It seems that she
took too many sedatives.</font>

634
00:54:53,536 --> 00:54:55,235
<font color="yellow">Her vitals are bad, too.</font>

635
00:54:55,235 --> 00:54:57,135
<font color="yellow">It seems that the blade
damaged her artery, doesn't it?</font>

636
00:54:57,135 --> 00:55:01,135
<font color="yellow">Let's hydrate her and move her
to the operating room quickly.</font>

637
00:55:01,135 --> 00:55:02,436
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

638
00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:10,635
<font color="yellow">All right. Tourniquet.</font>

639
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:11,735
<font color="yellow">It's ready, sir.</font>

640
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,735
<font color="yellow">- Set the pressure to 205.
- Yes, sir.</font>

641
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:44,735
<font color="yellow">Turn the tourniquet on.</font>

642
00:57:02,735 --> 00:57:05,536
<font color="yellow">The wound is small, but deep.</font>

643
00:57:05,536 --> 00:57:09,704
<font color="yellow">She's cut through an artery,
a nerve, and two tendons. No, three.</font>

644
00:57:09,704 --> 00:57:12,449
<font color="yellow">So we have to reconnect five things.
Have you ever done this before?</font>

645
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:16,793
<font color="yellow">I asked if you've done this before.</font>

646
00:57:16,793 --> 00:57:20,436
<font color="yellow">No. I've only ever seen the
procedure done in videos.</font>

647
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:22,135
<font color="yellow">This is the first time
I've actually done it.</font>

648
00:57:22,135 --> 00:57:25,036
<font color="yellow">If you make even a single
mistake from here on out</font>

649
00:57:25,036 --> 00:57:28,235
<font color="yellow">I'll cut your hand off and
stick it on Doctor Yoon.</font>

650
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:29,536
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>
