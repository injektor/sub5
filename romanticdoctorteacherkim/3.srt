<font color="yellow">The operation in the afternoon was definitely a general surgery.</font>

139

145
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,080

<font color="yellow">I'm asking very seriously.</font>

152
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,620
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're not just embarrassed of yourself?</font>

153
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,820
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

154
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,080
<font color="yellow">You were embarrassed of yourself back there.</font>

155
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,820
<font color="yellow">That's not all, right? You're a doctor,</font>

156
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,520
<font color="yellow">but you wasted your time at a casino bar early in the evening.</font>

157
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,950
<font color="yellow">You tried to use a defibrillator...</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll bet 100 dollars. He'll leave in 3 days for certain.</font>

312
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,180
<font color="yellow">I didn't know who he was back then.</font>

313
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,350
<font color="yellow">I came to know...</font>

314
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,320
<font color="yellow">that he passed the exam with the highest score in the country.</font>

315
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,280
<font color="yellow">He's like a jewel to us.</font>

316
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,990
<font color="yellow">We can't just let him go.</font>

317
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,380
<font color="yellow">The important thing is...</font>

318
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,280
<font color="yellow">his willingness.</font>

319
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,780
<font color="yellow">I have heard...</font>

320
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,990
<font color="yellow">that he wishes to leave...</font>

321
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,320
<font color="yellow">this dreaded hospital as soon as possible.</font>

322
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,350
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

323
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,380
<font color="yellow">That's why we should do something to keep him here.</font>

324
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,620
<font color="yellow">He's the top of his class,</font>

325
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,680
<font color="yellow">good looking, and young.</font>

326
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,350
<font color="yellow">If we just let him stand around,</font>

327
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,550
<font color="yellow">people around the area,</font>

328
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,720
<font color="yellow">especially the ladies,</font>

329
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,820
<font color="yellow">would be crazy about him.</font>

330
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,050
<font color="yellow">I can't believe what you said just now.</font>

331
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
<font color="yellow">It was really awful.</font>

332
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,680
<font color="yellow">Hospitals are all about providing services nowadays.</font>

333
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,050
<font color="yellow">The doctors...</font>

334
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,950
<font color="yellow">at our hospital are...</font>

335
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,150
<font color="yellow">too old.</font>

336
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,850
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Ms. Oh?</font>

337
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,580
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we ask for Master Kim's opinion?</font>

338
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,850
<font color="yellow">Master Kim can do his own thing.</font>

339
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,750
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's about time to have a normal doctor?</font>

340
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,550
<font color="yellow">- In that case... - Yes, President Yeo.</font>

341
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,020
<font color="yellow">- First, - Yes?</font>

342
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,780
<font color="yellow">let's hear from Master Kim.</font>

343
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
<font color="yellow">Can you do a checkup?</font>

344
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,320
<font color="yellow">He's not here yet.</font>

345
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,250
<font color="yellow">I mean Master Kim.</font>

346
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

347
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,580
<font color="yellow">Did you have lunch?</font>

348
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,020
<font color="yellow">It's Friday.</font>

349
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,620
<font color="yellow">Of course I ate. I ate twice as much.</font>

350
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,650
<font color="yellow">- Check this again. - Okay.</font>

351
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,720
<font color="yellow">Are you allowed to walk around?</font>

352
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,780
<font color="yellow">Does your doctor approve?</font>

353
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,080
<font color="yellow">It's Friday.</font>

354
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,050
<font color="yellow">I couldn't just sit around.</font>

355
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,650
<font color="yellow">I mean, I'm on the board for emergency surgeries.</font>

356
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,320
<font color="yellow">This is Doldam Hospital Emergency Room.</font>

357
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,450
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll get it ready.</font>

358
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,980
<font color="yellow">It's a motorcycle accident. Five patients will...</font>

359
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,080
<font color="yellow">arrive in five minutes.</font>

360
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,980
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

361
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,180
<font color="yellow">He's from the motorcycle accident.</font>

362
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,150
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have external bleeding, but he's unconscious.</font>

363
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,150
<font color="yellow">His blood pressure is between 70 to 100. He has minor scratches.</font>

364
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,650
<font color="yellow">We'll begin with the intubation.</font>

365
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,280
<font color="yellow">Set up IV lines and execute a full drop.</font>

366
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,080
<font color="yellow">Stick two pints of emergency pack RBC on him.</font>

367
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,180
<font color="yellow">He's a hit and run driver.</font>

368
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,020
<font color="yellow">The guy who drove into...</font>

369
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,720
<font color="yellow">your car.</font>

370
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,120
<font color="yellow">He ran away after hitting two middle school students.</font>

371
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,820
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

372
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,080
<font color="yellow">I will talk to the insurance company...</font>

373
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,080
<font color="yellow">and make sure the expenses for your car are fully paid.</font>

374
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,280
<font color="yellow">Do you want some?</font>

375
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,050
<font color="yellow">No, thanks. I don't like juice.</font>

376
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,680
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

377
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,750
<font color="yellow">(Mom)</font>

378
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,320
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

379
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,380
<font color="yellow">It's a call from the emergency room for a patient from a car accident.</font>

380
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

381
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,920
<font color="yellow">My dear Dr. Kang doesn't like...</font>

382
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,350
<font color="yellow">juice that much.</font>

383
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,650
<font color="yellow">He doesn't like to answer his mom's call, either.</font>

384
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,420
<font color="yellow">It's hemoperitoneum.</font>

385
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,220
<font color="yellow">He needs a surgery now. Can you do it?</font>

386
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,420
<font color="yellow">- Is his guardian here? - On their way.</font>

387
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,580
<font color="yellow">They'll be here in an hour.</font>

388
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,150
<font color="yellow">He needs a surgery now, though.</font>

389
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,150
<font color="yellow">I'll get his guardian's consent when they get here...</font>

390
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,380
<font color="yellow">and then begin the surgery.</font>

391
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,380
<font color="yellow">It'll take them about an hour.</font>

392
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,120
<font color="yellow">He may get a shock from excessive bleeding.</font>

393
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,520
<font color="yellow">Do his surgery first.</font>

394
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,150
<font color="yellow">What may go wrong is your wrist.</font>

395
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,680
<font color="yellow">You should go back and get some rest.</font>

396
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,420
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of him.</font>

397
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,450
<font color="yellow">No, thanks. I'll take care of it.</font>

398
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,580
<font color="yellow">The general surgeon is the one to call a surgery and I give orders.</font>

399
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,050
<font color="yellow">Wait until we have his guardian's consent, Seo Jung.</font>

400
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,250
<font color="yellow">I mean, Dr. Yoon Seo Jung.</font>

401
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,250
<font color="yellow">Are you scared that things will go wrong?</font>

402
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sticking to the rules.</font>

403
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,580
<font color="yellow">Doctors are responsible for things happening in an unconsented surgery.</font>

404
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,520
<font color="yellow">You should be thinking about ways to save him...</font>

405
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,520
<font color="yellow">instead of being worried about things that didn't happen.</font>

406
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,780
<font color="yellow">I've seen many doctors...</font>

407
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,820
<font color="yellow">who fought and got sued by the guardians after they did that.</font>

408
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,350
<font color="yellow">I'm not even at Geodae Hospital.</font>

409
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
<font color="yellow">Why would I get myself into such a trouble?</font>

410
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,050
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

411
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,980
<font color="yellow">- You're no fun at all. - I'm sorry,</font>

412
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,480
<font color="yellow">but I've always been like this.</font>

413
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,550
<font color="yellow">I always stick to the rules.</font>

414
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,180
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if you remember.</font>

415
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,080
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

416
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,120
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I didn't know, you jerk.</font>

417
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,020
<font color="yellow">- What? What did you say? - Forget it.</font>

418
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,450
<font color="yellow">We're taking him to the operating room.</font>

419
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,920
<font color="yellow">Let go. This is my patient now.</font>

420
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,220
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Both of you, stop.</font>

421
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,320
<font color="yellow">Go to the operating room and tell Dr. Nam to get ready.</font>

422
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,450
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim.</font>

423
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,580
<font color="yellow">Not you.</font>

424
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,750
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

425
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,580
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get the operating room ready.</font>

426
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,480
<font color="yellow">I will go. I can do it.</font>

427
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,750
<font color="yellow">No. Go away, Seo Jung.</font>

428
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,220
<font color="yellow">I'm fine now. I'm okay.</font>

429
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,550
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

430
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,480
<font color="yellow">Get away from this patient!</font>

431
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,650
<font color="yellow">According to the Medical Law article 8, clause 1...</font>

432
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,980
<font color="yellow">and the Mental Health Act Article 3, Clause 1, a mental patient...</font>

433
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,880
<font color="yellow">cannot perform as a doctor.</font>

434
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,650
<font color="yellow">You have hurt yourself.</font>

435
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,480
<font color="yellow">I can't let you be with a patient.</font>

436
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,720
<font color="yellow">You are disqualified from this hospital as of today.</font>

437
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,280
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim. - That's the end of my decision.</font>

438
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,380
<font color="yellow">I won't reconsider it, so don't bring it up.</font>

439
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,750
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

440
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,650
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

441
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,480
<font color="yellow">Go and get the operating room ready.</font>

442
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,480
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it was too harsh?</font>

443
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,880
<font color="yellow">How could you say she's disqualified?</font>

444
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,980
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak. Eun Tak!</font>

445
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

446
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,020
<font color="yellow">Tell Dr. Nam to prepare for an operation,</font>

447
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,880
<font color="yellow">and move this patient to the operating room.</font>

448
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,920
<font color="yellow">His guardian hasn't arrived yet.</font>

449
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,020
<font color="yellow">Get the consent over the phone.</font>

450
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,480
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Doctor. - Good.</font>

451
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,580
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

452
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,780
<font color="yellow">You'll be on call at the emergency room tonight.</font>

453
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,180
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

454
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,620
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see me kicking out the emergency medicine specialist?</font>

455
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,380
<font color="yellow">You should fill the position since the specialist isn't here.</font>

456
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,050
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

457
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,550
<font color="yellow">Surgeons are never on call for the emergency room.</font>

458
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,320
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking for your opinion.</font>

459
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,920
<font color="yellow">I'm giving you an order.</font>

460
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,220
<font color="yellow">It seems like you like taking orders.</font>

461
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,350
<font color="yellow">This is a special order I'm giving you as the head of General Surgery.</font>

462
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,480
<font color="yellow">So you'll be on call tonight.</font>

463
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,620

00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,650
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

617
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,720
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

618
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,050
<font color="yellow">I should leave now to be there on time.</font>

619
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,580
<font color="yellow">Don't be late. Do you hear me?</font>

620
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,890
<font color="yellow">Forget about your pride.</font>

621
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,480
<font color="yellow">Just think about yourself going back to Geodae Hospital.</font>

622
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,850
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Woo. - Yes.</font>

623
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,680
<font color="yellow">Put the metro on bed number eight.</font>

624
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,980
<font color="yellow">Kang Dong Joo.</font>

625
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,320
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

626
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,620
<font color="yellow">You should walk out that door right now.</font>

627
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,920
<font color="yellow">We have an emergency patient.</font>

628
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,480
<font color="yellow">He is a 48-year-old man.</font>

629
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,580
<font color="yellow">It seems he drank pesticide.</font>

630
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,320
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Are you all right?</font>

631
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,450
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Kang. - My gosh.</font>

632
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,520
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Kang. - Wake up!</font>

633
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,580
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

634
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,890
<font color="yellow">- Don't look back. - Wake up!</font>

635
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,050
<font color="yellow">This is your last chance.</font>

636
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,120
<font color="yellow">It is your last chance to go back to Geodae Hospital.</font>

637
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,920
<font color="yellow">As soon as I turn around,</font>

638
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,150
<font color="yellow">it will ruin my life.</font>

639
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,350
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang!</font>

640
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,580
<font color="yellow">Please save my son.</font>

641
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,890
<font color="yellow">Please save my son.</font>

642
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,250
<font color="yellow">Doctor, please.</font>

643
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,950
<font color="yellow">Please save my son. Doctor.</font>

644
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,650
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

645
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,950
<font color="yellow">Please save my son.</font>

646
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,390
<font color="yellow">Please help me.</font>

647
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,350
<font color="yellow">Doctor. Please.</font>

648
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,820
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

649
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,280
<font color="yellow">Please save my son.</font>

650
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,350
<font color="yellow">Doctor, please.</font>

651
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,150
<font color="yellow">Please save my son.</font>

652
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,180
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

653
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,050
<font color="yellow">A 48-year-old man drank pesticide as he was drunk.</font>

654
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
<font color="yellow">- Did you check the bottle? - It's organophosphate.</font>

655
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,890
<font color="yellow">Prepare charcoal...</font>

656
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,120
<font color="yellow">and check how many vials of atropine...</font>

657
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,150
<font color="yellow">- we have in stock. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

658
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,650
<font color="yellow">- Let's move him to the hybrid room. - Excuse me.</font>

659
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,420
<font color="yellow">Please wait outside the room.</font>

660
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,850
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Doctor. - This way, please.</font>

661
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,120
<font color="yellow">He will be all right.</font>

662
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,280
<font color="yellow">This way, please. He will be fine.</font>

663
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,390
<font color="yellow">Who else is coming?</font>

664
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,650
<font color="yellow">In fact,</font>

665
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,120
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang Dong Joo is coming.</font>

666
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,180
<font color="yellow">It's not that he is competent.</font>

667
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,350
<font color="yellow">But we need more fellow doctors in Department of General Surgery.</font>

668
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,820
<font color="yellow">You know what's happening in Department of General Surgery.</font>

669
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,120
<font color="yellow">Young doctors these days don't prefer to become a surgeon.</font>

670
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,420
<font color="yellow">The hospital is full of patients and lacks fellow doctors.</font>

671
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,980
<font color="yellow">It's not for Kang Dong Joo.</font>

672
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,450
<font color="yellow">It's for me, President Do.</font>

673
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,250
<font color="yellow">What about the list of cardiothoracic surgeons...</font>

674
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,850
<font color="yellow">- for the operation on the chairman? - Please don't worry about it.</font>

675
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,650
<font color="yellow">We will have the best cardiothoracic surgeons for the operation.</font>

676
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,620
<font color="yellow">You know there will be a board meeting in two months, don't you?</font>

677
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,780
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

678
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,980
<font color="yellow">I will do everything I can for your second consecutive term.</font>

679
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

680
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,350
<font color="yellow">Please let me express my gratitude.</font>

681
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,480
<font color="yellow">- How many liters is it? - It's 7L.</font>

682
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,680
<font color="yellow">Do you have the result of arterial blood gas analysis?</font>

683
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,820
<font color="yellow">It's here, Doctor.</font>

684
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,750
<font color="yellow">Is it 6.8pH?</font>

685
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,720
<font color="yellow">Bring me five ampules of sodium bicarbonate.</font>

686
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,680
<font color="yellow">- I will perform the intubation. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

687
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,420
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for coming here. - It's my pleasure.</font>

688
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,720
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

689
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,150
<font color="yellow">Let me check his heart rhythm.</font>

690
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,350
<font color="yellow">I will do it again.</font>

691
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,420
<font color="yellow">It's ready.</font>

692
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,580
<font color="yellow">Shock.</font>

693
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,150
<font color="yellow">- The number you have dialed... - Is he out of his mind?</font>

694
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,150
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo. What do you think you are doing?</font>

695
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,850
<font color="yellow">It's almost 9pm. Why aren't you coming?</font>

696
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,020
<font color="yellow">Did you have a car accident or something?</font>

697
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,950
<font color="yellow">Or are you trying to get smart with me?</font>

698
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,850
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving already?</font>

699
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,650
<font color="yellow">I'm tired tonight. I can't stay any longer.</font>

700
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,950
<font color="yellow">Well... President Do.</font>

701
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,380
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo. You idiot.</font>

702
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,680
<font color="yellow">You are doomed. Do you understand?</font>

703
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,750
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

704
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,720
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

705
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,150
<font color="yellow">You should pronounce him dead.</font>

706
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,720
<font color="yellow">It is...</font>

707
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,780
<font color="yellow">9:29pm now.</font>

708
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,750
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

709
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,850
<font color="yellow">Your son...</font>

710
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,950
<font color="yellow">passed away.</font>

711
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,650
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

712
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:54,220
<font color="yellow">Would you mind speaking a little bit louder?</font>

713
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,050
<font color="yellow">We were in such a hurry,</font>

714
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,320
<font color="yellow">so we forgot to bring hearing aids.</font>

715
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,520
<font color="yellow">I said your son passed away.</font>

716
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,820
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

717
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,720
<font color="yellow">I can't hear you.</font>

718
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,050
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

719
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:23,020
<font color="yellow">I know my son is a bit old,</font>

720
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,620
<font color="yellow">but he should meet someone nice and get married.</font>

721
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,820
<font color="yellow">Please treat him well.</font>

722
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,250
<font color="yellow">Please, Doctor.</font>

723
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,720
<font color="yellow">Why should I do this?</font>

724
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,180
<font color="yellow">Your son passed away.</font>

725
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,820
<font color="yellow">Your son died.</font>

726
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,750
<font color="yellow">He passed away.</font>

727
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,250
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

728
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,080
<font color="yellow">I want to see...</font>

729
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,950
<font color="yellow">my daughter-in-law before I die.</font>

730
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,920
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

731
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,020
<font color="yellow">He's...</font>

732
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,720
<font color="yellow">my one and only son.</font>

733
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,150
<font color="yellow">Please save him.</font>

734
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,880
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

735
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,550
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

736
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,650
<font color="yellow">Why am I...</font>

737
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,650
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

738
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,150
<font color="yellow">How could this...</font>

739
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,550
<font color="yellow">Not like this.</font>

740
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,120
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo. You idiot.</font>

741
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,180
<font color="yellow">You are doomed. Do you understand?</font>

742
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,450
<font color="yellow">Press one for the next voice message.</font>

743
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,850
<font color="yellow">(Mom)</font>

744
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,250
<font color="yellow">(Mom)</font>

745
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,280
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

746
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,280
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo? It's me.</font>

747
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,320
<font color="yellow">Have you been busy all day?</font>

748
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,280
<font color="yellow">You didn't call me.</font>

749
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,220
<font color="yellow">It's tough, isn't it?</font>

750
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,580
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Dr. Kang, this Friday went by smoothly.</font>

751
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,880
<font color="yellow">But still, it was unnecessary for you to leave the ER...</font>

752
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,250
<font color="yellow">entirely up to him. You should come back right away.</font>

753
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,880
<font color="yellow">I still have things to take care.</font>

754
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,720
<font color="yellow">I'll come back as soon as I'm done.</font>

755
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,250
<font color="yellow">I heard you put up a fight...</font>

756
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,780
<font color="yellow">against that person who caused a scene at the ICU.</font>

757
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,250
<font color="yellow">With that hand.</font>

758
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,980
<font color="yellow">You don't have a fever.</font>

759
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,650
<font color="yellow">No swelling.</font>

760
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,980
<font color="yellow">No heat sensation.</font>

761
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,750
<font color="yellow">This is looking better than I anticipated.</font>

762
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,180
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

763
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,880
<font color="yellow">I'm just checking on my patient.</font>

764
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,480
<font color="yellow">I want a different doctor. Please get me someone else.</font>

765
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,650
<font color="yellow">There aren't any other doctors in this place.</font>

766
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,880
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to call Master Kim for you?</font>

767
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,050
<font color="yellow">That wouldn't go very well, right?</font>

768
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,980
<font color="yellow">He disqualified you in your face.</font>

769
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,220
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

770
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,020
<font color="yellow">I thought you two were very close friends.</font>

771
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,620
<font color="yellow">I guess I was very wrong.</font>

772
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,680
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

773
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,980
<font color="yellow">Why are you here at Doldam Hospital?</font>

774
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,780
<font color="yellow">Why are you in my life again?</font>

775
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,050
<font color="yellow">I didn't come here because I wanted to.</font>

776
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,420
<font color="yellow">You just happened to be here when I got here.</font>

777
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,450
<font color="yellow">Don't you think this is wrong?</font>

778
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,720
<font color="yellow">You and me...</font>

779
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,780
<font color="yellow">in a same hospital?</font>

780
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,380
<font color="yellow">No, you're wrong.</font>

781
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,080
<font color="yellow">You're not even working here any more.</font>

782
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,420
<font color="yellow">You're such a jerk.</font>

783
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,750
<font color="yellow">Why did you change so much?</font>

784
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,020
<font color="yellow">I was always like this.</font>

785
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:23,420
<font color="yellow">Perhaps you don't remember,</font>

786
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,450
<font color="yellow">but I've always been straightforward.</font>

787
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,480
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

788
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,050
<font color="yellow">Why did you take a sedative?</font>

789
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,050
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone. I'm tired.</font>

790
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,280
<font color="yellow">I said get out.</font>

791
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,750
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you here. Leave me alone.</font>

792
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,820
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

793
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,720
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

794
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,220
<font color="yellow">Kang Dong Joo speaking.</font>

795
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,620
<font color="yellow">We have burn patients. Four in total.</font>

796
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,350
<font color="yellow">We need you down here.</font>

797
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,620
<font color="yellow">Burn patients?</font>

798
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,950
<font color="yellow">Did she say burn patients? How many?</font>

799
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,380
<font color="yellow">Four.</font>

800
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,850
<font color="yellow">The patients are here. Please hurry, Dr. Kang.</font>

801
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:21,820
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get down there.</font>

802
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,020
<font color="yellow">I've never treated a burn patient.</font>

803
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,120
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

804
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,850
<font color="yellow">A patient with a 1st-degree burn and 2 with 2nd-degree burn.</font>

805
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,520
<font color="yellow">There's 1 patient with 3rd-degree burn all over the body.</font>

806
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,150
<font color="yellow">Third-degree goes to the hybrid room and the rest go over there.</font>

807
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

808
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,820
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang. Please start with the third-degree burn patient.</font>

809
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,150
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Go after them.</font>

810
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,120
<font color="yellow">Secure the airway first and start the intubation.</font>

811
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,780
<font color="yellow">Intubation.</font>

812
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,620
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

813
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,720
<font color="yellow">The trachea is already swollen.</font>

814
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,080
<font color="yellow">Then perform cricothyroidotomy.</font>

815
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,720
<font color="yellow">- Prepare for cricothyroidotomy. - Okay.</font>

816
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,880
<font color="yellow">- Hold on. Give me the tube. - What do you need the tube for?</font>

817
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,080
<font color="yellow">Hey. What are you doing?</font>

818
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,320
<font color="yellow">Kang Dong Joo.</font>

819
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,250
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

820
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,880
<font color="yellow">Fix it to 23.</font>

821
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,250
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

822
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,580
<font color="yellow">Set up IV lines with 2L of hydration.</font>

823
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,450
<font color="yellow">Set up IV lines with 2L of hydration.</font>

824
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,480
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

825
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,380
<font color="yellow">- Warm saline. - Please prepare warm saline.</font>

826
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,520
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

827
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,880
<font color="yellow">You're doing good so far. You have to dress the burn wounds.</font>

828
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,020
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to measure the area of burn on the back.</font>

829
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,080
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

830
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,380
<font color="yellow">Hold this.</font>

831
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,520
<font color="yellow">Take deep breaths.</font>

832
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,180
<font color="yellow">Please check on the carboxyhemoglobin.</font>

833
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,380
<font color="yellow">Okay, Doctor.</font>

834
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,050
<font color="yellow">The patient's saturation is dropping.</font>

835
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,580
<font color="yellow">It must be a respiratory tract burn. I'll proceed with the intubation.</font>

836
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,980
<font color="yellow">Move over.</font>

837
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,050
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

838
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,980
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face?</font>

839
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,350
<font color="yellow">Dress the burn wounds.</font>

840
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,950
<font color="yellow">Where's the third-degree burn patient now?</font>

841
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,450
<font color="yellow">He's in the hybrid room with Dr. Kang.</font>

842
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,150
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Master Kim?</font>

843
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,320
<font color="yellow">Call the burn center.</font>

844
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,350
<font color="yellow">We need a chopper fast.</font>

845
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,680
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

846
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,850
<font color="yellow">He should be hospitalized for at least four weeks.</font>

847
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,420
<font color="yellow">Where did he get beaten?</font>

848
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,080
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

849
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,450
<font color="yellow">Okay, you're doing well.</font>

850
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,680
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

851
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,280
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

852
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,280
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

853
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,020
<font color="yellow">His blood circulation isn't well.</font>

854
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,620
<font color="yellow">His hand is blue.</font>

855
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,350
<font color="yellow">Burn contracture has began.</font>

856
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,850
<font color="yellow">Perform the escharotomy immediately.</font>

857
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,780
<font color="yellow">- Escharotomy? - Cut open his skin.</font>

858
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,120
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

859
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,320
<font color="yellow">If you don't, his skin will shrink and block his blood circulation.</font>

860
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,120
<font color="yellow">It'll build into necrosis.</font>

861
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,950
<font color="yellow">You're so frustrating.</font>

862
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,620
<font color="yellow">What's with him?</font>

863
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,650
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

864
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:23,380
<font color="yellow">Our Friday night is...</font>

865
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,050
<font color="yellow">not over yet.</font>

866
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,180
<font color="yellow">(Dr. Romantic)</font>

867
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,180
<font color="yellow">Why are you so scared? You haven't done anything wrong.</font>

868
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,120
<font color="yellow">You didn't bring Seo Jung in because of the patient.</font>

869
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,720
<font color="yellow">You needed her for yourself.</font>

870
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,850
<font color="yellow">That must be why you are so obsessed with...</font>

871
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,380
<font color="yellow">staying as a doctor at Geodae Hospital, you idiot.</font>

872
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,080
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything about me. Don't talk about me like that!</font>

873
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,220
<font color="yellow">You don't even know what it's like to live well.</font>

874
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,480
<font color="yellow">Stop trying to teach me how to live right.</font>

875
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,350
<font color="yellow">You disgust me.</font>
