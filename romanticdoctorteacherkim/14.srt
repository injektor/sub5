00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,560
<font color="yellow">She said those crabs were in season.</font>

316
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,490
<font color="yellow">When was this?</font>

317
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,190
<font color="yellow">It was right before my business trip.</font>

318
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,990
<font color="yellow">It's been about two months.</font>

319
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,530
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

320
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,290
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park, let's examine their sputum.</font>

321
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,090
<font color="yellow">- Their sputum? - I think they have paragonimiasis.</font>

322
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,990
<font color="yellow">That's why the eosinophil level was so high.</font>

323
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,460
<font color="yellow">I'm an idiot.</font>

324
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,660
<font color="yellow">Why didn't I catch that?</font>

325
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,290
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

326
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,330
<font color="yellow">I can't believe...</font>

327
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,090
<font color="yellow">you made the decision to send her in.</font>

328
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,690
<font color="yellow">If she was unlucky, she could have missed the operation.</font>

329
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,290
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stop her.</font>

330
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,090
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

331
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,630
<font color="yellow">That's how...</font>

332
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,630
<font color="yellow">the MERS turmoil came to an end.</font>

333
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,360
<font color="yellow">It was just a case of paragonimiasis...</font>

334
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
<font color="yellow">caused by unfermented marinated crabs.</font>

335
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,960
<font color="yellow">(Doldam Hospital)</font>

336
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,990
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

337
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,030
<font color="yellow">When did you wake up?</font>

338
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,330
<font color="yellow">Just now.</font>

339
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,430
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

340
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,090
<font color="yellow">Your fever is gone.</font>

341
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,430
<font color="yellow">You look better, too.</font>

342
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,490
<font color="yellow">Are you dizzy? Or do you have any ear pains?</font>

343
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,560
<font color="yellow">You had three cases of overworking.</font>

344
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,730
<font color="yellow">Lack of sleep, lack of water, and lack of nutrition.</font>

345
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,690
<font color="yellow">Why were you so stubborn?</font>

346
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,030
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you lived here for two months.</font>

347
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,560
<font color="yellow">Was it you?</font>

348
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,060
<font color="yellow">What was?</font>

349
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,360
<font color="yellow">You were with me this whole time.</font>

350
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,930
<font color="yellow">You held my hand.</font>

351
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,560
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry. I'll get some food.</font>

352
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,990
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

353
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,530
<font color="yellow">You must have dreamt it. No.</font>

354
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,490
<font color="yellow">- No? - No.</font>

355
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,290
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

356
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,560
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

357
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,160
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

358
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,560
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

359
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,330
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

360
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,460
<font color="yellow">I am checking to see...</font>

361
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,390
<font color="yellow">if you are lying or not.</font>

362
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,390
<font color="yellow">Look, you just avoided my eye contact.</font>

363
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,260
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

364
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,030
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

365
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,790
<font color="yellow">It was paragonimiasis, not MERS.</font>

366
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,690
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

367
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,760
<font color="yellow">Yes. It was because of the pre-fermented marinated crab.</font>

368
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,360
<font color="yellow">So it was paragonimiasis.</font>

369
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,860
<font color="yellow">It's funny, right?</font>

370
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

371
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,760
<font color="yellow">Fine. It was me. I was by your side.</font>

372
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

373
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,930
<font color="yellow">You also held my hand.</font>

374
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,230
<font color="yellow">I was checking if you had fever.</font>

375
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,330
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much you were burning up?</font>

376
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,560
<font color="yellow">It went up to 39.8°C.</font>

377
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,530
<font color="yellow">It went as high up as...</font>

378
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,460
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

379
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,690
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

380
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,560
<font color="yellow">I'm dizzy.</font>

381
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,630
<font color="yellow">Let me stay like this for a while.</font>

382
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,930
<font color="yellow">If you're dizzy, you should eat.</font>

383
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,830
<font color="yellow">You should eat.</font>

384
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

385
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,360
<font color="yellow">lost all my power to resist him.</font>

386
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,560
<font color="yellow">This paragonimiasis.</font>

387
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,030
<font color="yellow">Ms. Woo?</font>

388
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,090
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Woo Yeon Hwa and I'll be working as a pay doctor here.</font>

389
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,960
<font color="yellow">I look forward to working with you.</font>

390
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,690
<font color="yellow">What's going on, President Yeo?</font>

391
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,030
<font color="yellow">She used to be a resident at Gangwon Hospital.</font>

392
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,890
<font color="yellow">But I thought your nationality was Chinese.</font>

393
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,330
<font color="yellow">I'm an international student.</font>

394
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,530
<font color="yellow">An international student?</font>

395
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,560
<font color="yellow">You must come from a wealthy background.</font>

396
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,890
<font color="yellow">My mother is Korean.</font>

397
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,930
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

398
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,190
<font color="yellow">Then why were you admitted here looking like a homeless?</font>

399
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,660
<font color="yellow">I was a medical resident who fled.</font>

400
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,660
<font color="yellow">You should have told us so.</font>

401
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,630
<font color="yellow">Back then, I didn't want to be a doctor ever again.</font>

402
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,860
<font color="yellow">It was too exhausting for me.</font>

403
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,560
<font color="yellow">Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?</font>

404
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,230
<font color="yellow">Because of you all.</font>

405
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,630
<font color="yellow">When I saw the staff working at this hospital,</font>

406
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,160
<font color="yellow">I thought to myself,</font>

407
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,990
<font color="yellow">"I want to become a real doctor."</font>

408
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,530
<font color="yellow">This is good news.</font>

409
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,330
<font color="yellow">A familiar face will be joining us.</font>

410
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,560
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Master Kim?</font>

411
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,330
<font color="yellow">So, what's your specialty?</font>

412
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,860
<font color="yellow">I'm a GS.</font>

413
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,930
<font color="yellow">She even studied general surgery.</font>

414
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,690
<font color="yellow">This is good.</font>

415
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,230
<font color="yellow">Even foreigners apply for general surgery.</font>

416
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,690
<font color="yellow">The domestic students should learn a thing or two.</font>

417
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,130
<font color="yellow">They all want to be dermatologists or plastic surgeons for money.</font>

418
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,560
<font color="yellow">They almost never apply for general surgery or cardiothoracic surgery</font>

419
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,190
<font color="yellow">This isn't right. Korea is supposed to be a medical powerhouse.</font>

420
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,560
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

421
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,660
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

422
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,790
<font color="yellow">You have a fair point, but it is not the appropriate time for that.</font>

423
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,430
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

424
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,530
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

425
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,530
<font color="yellow">I'll consider myself an intern and try my absolute best.</font>

426
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,460
<font color="yellow">I'm looking forward to working with you.</font>

427
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,230
<font color="yellow">You were a resident?</font>

428
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,860
<font color="yellow">I'm here as a pay doctor,</font>

429
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,830
<font color="yellow">but think of me as an intern and shove me around as much as you want.</font>

430
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,890
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

431
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,160
<font color="yellow">I like your mindset.</font>

432
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,560
<font color="yellow">How's your stamina?</font>

433
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,690
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty determined.</font>

434
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,630
<font color="yellow">You're even determined?</font>

435
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,090
<font color="yellow">Hello, Doctor.</font>

436
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,990
<font color="yellow">Hello, Yeon Hwa.</font>

437
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,130
<font color="yellow">She used to be a resident at Gangwon Hospital.</font>

438
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,960
<font color="yellow">On top of that, she was a GS.</font>

439
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,660
<font color="yellow">Is that right? General surgery?</font>

440
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,530
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - This is good news.</font>

441
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,490
<font color="yellow">Starting today,</font>

442
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,290
<font color="yellow">I'll give you all kinds of valuable advice.</font>

443
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,430
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hwa...</font>

444
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,030
<font color="yellow">Can I call you by your name?</font>

445
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,560
<font color="yellow">Of course. You can call me whatever you like.</font>

446
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,630
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

447
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,790
<font color="yellow">You can depend on me, Yeon Hwa.</font>

448
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,790
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Be careful, Yeon Hwa.</font>

449
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,560
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung's also known as Crazy Whale.</font>

450
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,690
<font color="yellow">- You little... - What? I'm right.</font>

451
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,060
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo. Do you want some pizza?</font>

452
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,790
<font color="yellow">Where did that come from?</font>

453
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,030
<font color="yellow">I got it last night.</font>

454
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,930
<font color="yellow">I just heated it up. It's hot.</font>

455
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,890
<font color="yellow">Eat all you want.</font>

456
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,790
<font color="yellow">From now on, snacks are on me.</font>

457
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,390
<font color="yellow">I'm serious. 100 percent.</font>

458
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,490
<font color="yellow">Thank you, In Soo.</font>

459
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,690
<font color="yellow">Do you want some, Manager Jang?</font>

460
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,730
<font color="yellow">I'll pass. I'm on a diet.</font>

461
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,930
<font color="yellow">Come eat, Yeon Hwa.</font>

462
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,060
<font color="yellow">We should eat while we can or...</font>

463
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,160
<font color="yellow">We have TA patients. All three are seriously injured.</font>

464
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,060
<font color="yellow">See that?</font>

465
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,730
<font color="yellow">This is what happens.</font>

466
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,160
<font color="yellow">They'll be arriving in three minutes.</font>

467
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,730
<font color="yellow">Three minutes.</font>

468
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,390
<font color="yellow">Take your time and unpack your things.</font>

469
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,790
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Until later.</font>

470
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,390
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you again, Yeon Hwa.</font>

471
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,960
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

472
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,290
<font color="yellow">It's a TA patient.</font>

473
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,830
<font color="yellow">She's a 35-year-old female driver.</font>

474
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,760
<font color="yellow">It looks like she smashed her head into the steering wheel.</font>

475
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,890
<font color="yellow">Her blood pressure is normal, but she's vomiting.</font>

476
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,790
<font color="yellow">She's experiencing a severe headache and dizziness.</font>

477
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,790
<font color="yellow">What about her vital signs?</font>

478
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,760
<font color="yellow">It's 100 over 65 and 120 beats per minute.</font>

479
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,160
<font color="yellow">It could be hemorrhage.</font>

480
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,060
<font color="yellow">Execute drops of maxolon, then I'll do a brain CT on her.</font>

481
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,890
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Doctor. - One, two, three.</font>

482
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,830
<font color="yellow">The glass window broke and got embedded in her arm.</font>

483
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,560
<font color="yellow">I'll take a look at your arm, Miss. Stop crying.</font>

484
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,930
<font color="yellow">Are you experiencing pain in any other parts of your body?</font>

485
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,030
<font color="yellow">No. Please get it out.</font>

486
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,230
<font color="yellow">Pieces of glass could still be in there. You need to get X-rayed.</font>

487
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,230
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Park. X-ray scan, please. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

488
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,690
<font color="yellow">- What's the status? - He's experiencing shoulder pain.</font>

489
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,360
<font color="yellow">- It hurts. - It's dislocated.</font>

490
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,460
<font color="yellow">Sir, your shoulder seems to be dislocated. We have to X-ray you.</font>

491
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,230
<font color="yellow">- Get on it, Ms. Eom. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

492
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,290
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

493
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
<font color="yellow">It's you again. Please go wait on that bed.</font>

494
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,830
<font color="yellow">Master Kim...</font>

495
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,130
<font color="yellow">Master Kim...</font>

496
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,330
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

497
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,860
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

498
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,060
<font color="yellow">Mr. Goo.</font>

499
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,630
<font color="yellow">Is it a cardiac arrest?</font>

500
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,060
<font color="yellow">This patient has a pacemaker.</font>

501
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,490
<font color="yellow">How are his vital signs?</font>

502
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,030
<font color="yellow">Systolic 60 and 40 beats per minute with no spontaneous breathing.</font>

503
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,090
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

504
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,330
<font color="yellow">Please page Master Kim. I'll start with intubation.</font>

505
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
<font color="yellow">Let's move the patient.</font>

506
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,400
<font color="yellow">What are you still doing with the Ambu bag?</font>

507
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,190
<font color="yellow">Get him on the ventilator.</font>

508
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,400
<font color="yellow">I was about to do that.</font>

509
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,760
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh.</font>

510
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,130
<font color="yellow">Mix dopamine with dobutamine...</font>

511
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,290
<font color="yellow">and execute drops of 10cc per hour.</font>

512
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,290
<font color="yellow">Get Isoket ready...</font>

513
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,260
<font color="yellow">and use it when the patient's blood pressure increases.</font>

514
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,230
<font color="yellow">Insert a Foley catheter and check his urine.</font>

515
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,290
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

516
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
<font color="yellow">This is the ABGA report.</font>

517
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,660
<font color="yellow">I think you should go there, Dr. Yoon.</font>

518
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,400
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

519
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,230
<font color="yellow">This is the ABGA report.</font>

520
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,430
<font color="yellow">It's a respiratory acidosis.</font>

521
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,760
<font color="yellow">I'll do echocardiography.</font>

522
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,790
<font color="yellow">It's DCMP and ejection fraction is very low.</font>

523
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,400
<font color="yellow">It's 25 to 30 percent at best.</font>

524
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,330
<font color="yellow">You said you have done an ECMO operation, right?</font>

525
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,030
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I have. - Not you. Hey!</font>

526
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,160
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you, In Beom.</font>

527
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, I have.</font>

528
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,860
<font color="yellow">Okay. You'll be the surgeon.</font>

529
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,160
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung, you'll be the assistant and page Dr. Nam.</font>

530
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,760
<font color="yellow">Do it fast before the machine gets here.</font>

531
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,860
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

532
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,930
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

533
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,490
<font color="yellow">Will you help me?</font>

534
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,130
<font color="yellow">With what?</font>

535
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,260
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

536
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,900
<font color="yellow">I want to give a woman I can't tell you the name...</font>

537
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,030
<font color="yellow">of a Christmas present.</font>

538
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
<font color="yellow">Which one looks better?</font>

539
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,990
<font color="yellow">Christmas gifts?</font>

540
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,490
<font color="yellow">Isn't it romantic?</font>

541
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,190
<font color="yellow">Exchanging Christmas gifts...</font>

542
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,660
<font color="yellow">and warm hugs?</font>

543
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

544
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,090
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

545
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,490
<font color="yellow">If you have...</font>

546
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,030
<font color="yellow">a secret crush on someone,</font>

547
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,400
<font color="yellow">why don't you make a move with a Christmas gift?</font>

548
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,060
<font color="yellow">No, I'm okay.</font>

549
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,460
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

550
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,760
<font color="yellow">Is this better?</font>

551
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,930
<font color="yellow">This one looks nice.</font>

552
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,460
<font color="yellow">- Proceed. - Needle.</font>

553
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,230
<font color="yellow">Guide wire.</font>

554
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
<font color="yellow">Scalpel.</font>

555
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,060
<font color="yellow">Gauze.</font>

556
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,430
<font color="yellow">Pass me the smallest dilator.</font>

557
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,190
<font color="yellow">The next one.</font>

558
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,290
<font color="yellow">I will put in the cannulas.</font>

559
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,330
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

560
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,530
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - Are you sure about this?</font>

561
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,290
<font color="yellow">It seems Dr. Do got confused for a moment.</font>

562
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
<font color="yellow">Infusion line has a red label.</font>

563
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,130
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

564
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,130
<font color="yellow">I was a little carried away.</font>

565
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,460
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

566
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,030
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon, switch places with Dr. Do.</font>

567
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,530
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Oh, assist the operation. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

568
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,190
<font color="yellow">Dr. Do.</font>

569
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,230
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

570
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,730
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

571
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,530
<font color="yellow">What's the difference between...</font>

572
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,130
<font color="yellow">veno-venous and veno-arterial in ECMO?</font>

573
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,490
<font color="yellow">Veno-venous is used for respiratory failure...</font>

574
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,690
<font color="yellow">while veno-arterial is used for heart failure.</font>

575
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,530
<font color="yellow">- What was the operation for? - It was for veno-arterial.</font>

576
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,330
<font color="yellow">Why do you pull the drain line to right atrium?</font>

577
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,130
<font color="yellow">That's because of...</font>

578
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,360
<font color="yellow">a possibility of IVC collapse in case of increase in ECMO flow.</font>

579
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,560
<font color="yellow">Why does it matter?</font>

580
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,930
<font color="yellow">There might not be enough of returning blood to the drain.</font>

581
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,730
<font color="yellow">Do you think you know that so well?</font>

582
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,560
<font color="yellow">How could you make such a mistake with cannulas?</font>

583
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,400
<font color="yellow">You'd thought...</font>

584
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,430
<font color="yellow">it was something that anyone with good techniques could do.</font>

585
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,400
<font color="yellow">But you clearly overlooked one thing.</font>

586
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,900
<font color="yellow">ECMO is...</font>

587
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,560
<font color="yellow">all about physiology which is more than...</font>

588
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,690
<font color="yellow">inserting cannulas.</font>

589
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,660
<font color="yellow">You may...</font>

590
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,660
<font color="yellow">deceive me with your words,</font>

591
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,030
<font color="yellow">but you can't do that with your hands.</font>

592
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,560
<font color="yellow">A surgeon's hands never lie...</font>

593
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,360
<font color="yellow">about his experiences and efforts.</font>

594
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,460
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

595
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,430
<font color="yellow">lied about something that you'd never actually done.</font>

596
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,330
<font color="yellow">And you attempted to slip a trick over on me.</font>

597
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,260
<font color="yellow">I won't ask you...</font>

598
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,660
<font color="yellow">why you had to do all those things.</font>

599
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,630
<font color="yellow">But,</font>

600
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,160
<font color="yellow">Do not degrade yourself...</font>

601
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,400
<font color="yellow">by acting as if you were expendable.</font>

602
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,460
<font color="yellow">Are you coming from the airport?</font>

603
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,900
<font color="yellow">Of course I am. Chairman Shin is in the hospital.</font>

604
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,290
<font color="yellow">Where is he now?</font>

605
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,560
<font color="yellow">How is he doing?</font>

606
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,760
<font color="yellow">He's not in this hospital at the moment.</font>

607
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,260
<font color="yellow">I heard he was hospitalized.</font>

608
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,430
<font color="yellow">He's at Doldam Hospital in Jeongseon.</font>

609
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,430
<font color="yellow">In fact, that's why I wanted to meet with you.</font>

610
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,330
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

611
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,430
<font color="yellow">Is anything wrong?</font>

612
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,330
<font color="yellow">This is what I was concerned about in the first place.</font>

613
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,930
<font color="yellow">Don't try to scare me.</font>

614
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,660
<font color="yellow">Just come to the point.</font>

615
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,290
<font color="yellow">It seems your artificial heart has a mechanical problem.</font>

616
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,630
<font color="yellow">For this situation,</font>

617
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,730
<font color="yellow">we should replace your artificial heart instead of changing batteries.</font>

618
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:42,360
<font color="yellow">And it is not an easy operation.</font>

619
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:45,990
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

620
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,230
<font color="yellow">How could you let him have such a risky operation in a small hospital?</font>

621
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,090
<font color="yellow">I tried to persuade him,</font>

622
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,660
<font color="yellow">but he didn't listen to me.</font>

623
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,790
<font color="yellow">So I asked you to come all the way...</font>

624
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,290
<font color="yellow">to persuade him.</font>

625
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,260
<font color="yellow">I understand...</font>

626
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,430
<font color="yellow">how stubborn he is.</font>

627
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,660
<font color="yellow">No one can reason him out of his obstinacy.</font>

628
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:08,990
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

629
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,090
<font color="yellow">who is his doctor? Is he good?</font>

630
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,690
<font color="yellow">He is Master Kim.</font>

631
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,490
<font color="yellow">Master Kim?</font>

632
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,630
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if you remember him or not.</font>

633
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,030
<font color="yellow">He used to work at Geodae Hospital...</font>

634
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,330
<font color="yellow">with his name, Boo Yong Joo.</font>

635
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,690
<font color="yellow">Boo Yong Joo?</font>

636
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,160
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about that jerk?</font>

637
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,960
<font color="yellow">What? Now do you feel...</font>

638
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
<font color="yellow">scared?</font>

639
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,030
<font color="yellow">We have to remove your artificial heart...</font>

640
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,090
<font color="yellow">and replace it with a new one.</font>

641
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,490
<font color="yellow">That's a very rare case.</font>

642
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,390
<font color="yellow">We don't even have exact numbers for the success rate.</font>

643
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,230
<font color="yellow">It means there are only few cases for the operation.</font>

644
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,430
<font color="yellow">You should be honored, then.</font>

645
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,560
<font color="yellow">I'm giving you...</font>

646
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,690
<font color="yellow">a chance to perform such a rare operation.</font>

647
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,290
<font color="yellow">Aren't you confident?</font>

648
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,230
<font color="yellow">If it's not that, you should do this.</font>

649
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
<font color="yellow">May I ask...</font>

650
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,430
<font color="yellow">why do you have...</font>

651
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,030
<font color="yellow">absolute confidence in me?</font>

652
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,830
<font color="yellow">I already gave you my answer.</font>

653
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,290
<font color="yellow">I'm a patient who struggles to survive,</font>

654
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:24,690
<font color="yellow">and you are a doctor who tries to save a person's life.</font>

655
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,990
<font color="yellow">We are two men of tenacity.</font>

656
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:33,130
<font color="yellow">That makes the chance of me surviving go up.</font>

657
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,530
<font color="yellow">Every doctor...</font>

658
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,060
<font color="yellow">tries his best to save a patient's life all the time.</font>

659
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,460
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

660
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,190
<font color="yellow">they will do the same...</font>

661
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,530
<font color="yellow">when billions of dollars are at stake?</font>

662
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,490
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - Cut the chatter. You're doing it.</font>

663
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,060
<font color="yellow">Even if I die during surgery,</font>

664
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,660
<font color="yellow">I won't hold a grudge if you perform the surgery.</font>

665
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,690
<font color="yellow">We will do a CT scan on you tomorrow morning.</font>

666
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,290
<font color="yellow">And we will conduct the examination...</font>

667
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,160
<font color="yellow">that's been delayed because of MERS.</font>

668
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,230
<font color="yellow">Nine days later,</font>

669
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,360
<font color="yellow">we will perform the operation on Chairman Shin.</font>

670
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,630
<font color="yellow">We will remove his artificial heart...</font>

671
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,760
<font color="yellow">and replace it with a new one.</font>

672
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,230
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Kang. - Yes.</font>

673
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,830
<font color="yellow">You will be removing the batteries in the abdominal region.</font>

674
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,030
<font color="yellow">They were transplanted two years ago,</font>

675
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,460
<font color="yellow">so they must be stuck tight to the fibrous tissues.</font>

676
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,030
<font color="yellow">Once you remove them,</font>

677
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,560
<font color="yellow">I will begin to remove...</font>

678
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,360
<font color="yellow">- the main device immediately. Okay? - Okay.</font>

679
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,290
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Yoon. - Yes.</font>

680
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,090
<font color="yellow">You will be the first assistant as originally planned.</font>

681
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,990
<font color="yellow">It is all about speed.</font>

682
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,130
<font color="yellow">Make sure to be well prepared.</font>

683
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

684
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
<font color="yellow">Dr. Do.</font>

685
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,630
<font color="yellow">You will be Dr. Kang's assistant, okay?</font>

686
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,960
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

687
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,290
<font color="yellow">Before the operation,</font>

688
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,890
<font color="yellow">we will simulate the procedures three times.</font>

689
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,960
<font color="yellow">I will let you know as soon as the schedule is fixed.</font>

690
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,190
<font color="yellow">So keep everything in mind. That's all.</font>

691
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,690
<font color="yellow">Are you all ready?</font>

692
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,830
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Master Kim. - Yes, Master Kim.</font>

693
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,490
<font color="yellow">Scalpel.</font>

694
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,290
<font color="yellow">Cut open his chest and insert a cannula.</font>

695
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,090
<font color="yellow">Set up the heart-lung machine. These must be done in three hours.</font>

696
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,660
<font color="yellow">Make an incision into the abdominal subcutaneous tissue,</font>

697
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,560
<font color="yellow">and remove the battery, the TET,</font>

698
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,160
<font color="yellow">and the controller within 45 minutes.</font>

699
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,460
<font color="yellow">Do we have 45 minutes for both incision and removal?</font>

700
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,730
<font color="yellow">No, it includes the closing the incision.</font>

701
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:59,790
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that the patient is 72 years old.</font>

702
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,330
<font color="yellow">We need to reduce the surgery time as much as possible.</font>

703
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,460
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

704
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,830
<font color="yellow">Switch the positions.</font>

705
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,690
<font color="yellow">Remove the existing artificial heart in two hours.</font>

706
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,060
<font color="yellow">Install the new model in two hours.</font>

707
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,330
<font color="yellow">Stop the bleeding in 1 hour, and close up the chest in 1 hour.</font>

708
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,160
<font color="yellow">The total surgery time is 9 hours and 45 minutes.</font>

709
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,330
<font color="yellow">That's not good.</font>

710
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,960
<font color="yellow">We have to reduce it to seven hours...</font>

711
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,730
<font color="yellow">to minimize the damage from the surgery.</font>

712
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,330
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

713
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:32,890
<font color="yellow">let's finish setting up the heart-lung machine in two hours.</font>

714
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,790
<font color="yellow">Let's finish replacing the hearts 30 minutes faster...</font>

715
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,430
<font color="yellow">for each process.</font>

716
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,530
<font color="yellow">We still have 45 minutes left.</font>

717
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:43,490
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll finish my work in 30 minutes.</font>

718
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,830
<font color="yellow">I'll make an incision...</font>

719
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,030
<font color="yellow">and remove the battery, the TET, and the controller...</font>

720
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,290
<font color="yellow">in 30 minutes.</font>

721
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,630
<font color="yellow">Seal it up, too.</font>

722
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,630
<font color="yellow">I'll give it a try.</font>

723
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,830
<font color="yellow">That's not good enough.</font>

724
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,860
<font color="yellow">- I'll pull it off. - Okay.</font>

725
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,760
<font color="yellow">We still need to reduce 30 minutes, Master Kim.</font>

726
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,660
<font color="yellow">Do you have any idea?</font>

727
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,730
<font color="yellow">The preparation of the surgery is going well.</font>

728
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:12,230
<font color="yellow">It seems that everyone thinks it will be successful.</font>

729
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,430
<font color="yellow">I think Chairman Shin believes so, too.</font>

730
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:20,390
<font color="yellow">Unexpected changes can happen anytime.</font>

731
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,160
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

732
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,830
<font color="yellow">how much longer should I work here?</font>

733
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,530
<font color="yellow">Until I say that's enough.</font>

734
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:30,190
<font color="yellow">Until then, swallow the pill.</font>

735
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,930
<font color="yellow">I'll get in touch soon.</font>

736
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,960
<font color="yellow">Do not degrade yourself...</font>

737
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,230
<font color="yellow">by acting as if you were expendable.</font>

738
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,560
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

739
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,560
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

740
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,760
<font color="yellow">The one is for me, but the other is...</font>

741
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:58,790
<font color="yellow">not for me.</font>

742
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,390
<font color="yellow">What am I doing?</font>

743
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,630
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

744
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,360
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving now?</font>

745
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,860
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm a little tired.</font>

746
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,790
<font color="yellow">I'm going home to rest.</font>

747
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,090
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

748
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,960
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

749
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,190
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon.</font>

750
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,990
<font color="yellow">There's another package for you.</font>

751
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,090
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

752
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,930
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure, but it seems to be...</font>

753
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:18,530
<font color="yellow">from someone who wants to spend Christmas with you.</font>

754
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,190
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

755
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,660
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo.</font>

756
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,530
<font color="yellow">Can I talk to you for a second?</font>

757
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,130
<font color="yellow">You said she would like it.</font>

758
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,160
<font color="yellow">Women usually like it.</font>

759
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,990
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's not her preference.</font>

760
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,790
<font color="yellow">Does she like handbags?</font>

761
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:34,790
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

762
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,730
<font color="yellow">It's my Christmas gift for you.</font>

763
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,090
<font color="yellow">I heard that kind of gift makes a woman happy.</font>

764
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:45,790
<font color="yellow">Take it back.</font>

765
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,160
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

766
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,390
<font color="yellow">Do you not like it?</font>

767
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,490
<font color="yellow">I don't want to receive it.</font>

768
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,030
<font color="yellow">Take it back.</font>

769
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,130
<font color="yellow">What do you mean...</font>

770
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,330
<font color="yellow">you don't want to receive it?</font>

771
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:19,360
<font color="yellow">I didn't imply anything by saying that.</font>

772
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,760
<font color="yellow">I just don't want it.</font>

773
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,490
<font color="yellow">Do you hate me that much?</font>

774
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,660
<font color="yellow">As a man,</font>

775
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,560
<font color="yellow">am I not good enough for you?</font>

776
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,360
<font color="yellow">- It's not like that. - Then, what?</font>

777
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,390
<font color="yellow">How do you...</font>

778
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,060

<font color="yellow">I...</font>

780
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,760
<font color="yellow">like you.</font>

781
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,930
<font color="yellow">- Then, why? - However,</font>

782
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,490
<font color="yellow">the deeper my feelings for you grow,</font>

783
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,630
<font color="yellow">the more I think of the accident that happened five years ago.</font>

784
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,160
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

785
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,960
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't put the accident...</font>

786
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,290
<font color="yellow">before my feelings for you.</font>

787
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:44,090
<font color="yellow">That's disrespectful to you,</font>

788
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,860
<font color="yellow">and I feel bad for you.</font>

789
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,290
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

790
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,430
<font color="yellow">So, Dong Joo,</font>

791
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,960
<font color="yellow">- we cannot... - I wouldn't mind that.</font>

792
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,230
<font color="yellow">There has been...</font>

793
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,830
<font color="yellow">only one thing that I wanted from you.</font>

794
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,730
<font color="yellow">And I just heard...</font>

795
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,730
<font color="yellow">the answer I wanted to hear.</font>

796
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,230
<font color="yellow">That's enough for me.</font>

797
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,560
<font color="yellow">As long as you have feelings for me,</font>

798
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,730
<font color="yellow">everything else doesn't matter.</font>

799
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,330
<font color="yellow">So please...</font>

00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,390
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung, please...</font>

801
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,230
