1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,940
<font color="yellow">Are these people...</font>

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,170
<font color="yellow">the staff members who will participate in my surgery?</font>

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,610
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Chairman Shin.
- I see.</font>

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,340
<font color="yellow">They all look trustworthy.</font>

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,370
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, I agree with you.</font>

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,840
<font color="yellow">I was discussing...</font>

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,410
<font color="yellow">your surgery with them.</font>

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,140
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,170
<font color="yellow">In fact, I came down here...</font>

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,540
<font color="yellow">to talk about it.</font>

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,710
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim.
- Yes?</font>

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,870
<font color="yellow">Let us...</font>

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,410
<font color="yellow">stick to our original plan.</font>

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,070
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,470
<font color="yellow">Just as we planned,</font>

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,070
<font color="yellow">let's proceed with the surgery.</font>

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,070
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin.</font>

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,540
<font color="yellow">I think Geodae Hospital needs...</font>

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,970
<font color="yellow">a young chairman at this juncture.</font>

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,240
<font color="yellow">So I'd like to have you...</font>

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,340
<font color="yellow">as the next chairman of the foundation.</font>

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,970
<font color="yellow">Watch what you say about that.</font>

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,070
<font color="yellow">My father...</font>

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,940
<font color="yellow">is still in good condition.</font>

26
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,240
<font color="yellow">I know...</font>

27
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,940
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't feel comfortable talking about it.</font>

28
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,440
<font color="yellow">But it wouldn't be amiss...</font>

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
<font color="yellow">to have some ideas of what's ahead and do something.</font>

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,670
<font color="yellow">He is...</font>

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,740
<font color="yellow">He is going to have the operation.</font>

32
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,940
<font color="yellow">- Is he going to have the operation?
- Yes.</font>

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,970
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin wants to proceed with it no matter what.</font>

34
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,340
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

35
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,470
<font color="yellow">make your decision after due consideration?</font>

36
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,010
<font color="yellow">Of course I did.</font>

37
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,270
<font color="yellow">It is a matter of life and death.</font>

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,370
<font color="yellow">I know I am old...</font>

39
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,610
<font color="yellow">and I've lived long enough.</font>

40
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,640
<font color="yellow">But it doesn't mean that I don't cling to life.</font>

41
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,340
<font color="yellow">On the contrary,</font>

42
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,110
<font color="yellow">I don't have long to live,</font>

43
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,170
<font color="yellow">so I desperately want to live longer.</font>

44
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,210
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,580
<font color="yellow">just not right.</font>

46
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,510
<font color="yellow">Should I wait until I die...</font>

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,040
<font color="yellow">doing nothing?</font>

48
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,040
<font color="yellow">That doesn't sound like me.</font>

49
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,670
<font color="yellow">It's not a simple operation where we just replace batteries.</font>

50
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,740
<font color="yellow">We are talking about replacing the artificial heart itself.</font>

51
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,410
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy...</font>

52
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,140
<font color="yellow">to go through the operation.</font>

53
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,170
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

54
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,110
<font color="yellow">Do you still want to...</font>

55
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,270
<font color="yellow">proceed with the operation?</font>

56
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,370
<font color="yellow">Even if I have one day left to live,</font>

57
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,640
<font color="yellow">I want to live a decent life.</font>

58
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,040
<font color="yellow">I want to die like that.</font>

59
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,640
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,940
<font color="yellow">I want you...</font>

61
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,540
<font color="yellow">to respect my choice.</font>

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,470
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

63
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,370
<font color="yellow">What did Boo Yong Joo say?</font>

64
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,010
<font color="yellow">Did he say...</font>

65
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,540
<font color="yellow">- he'd perform the operation?
- I'm not sure.</font>

66
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,870
<font color="yellow">What if he says yes?</font>

67
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,140
<font color="yellow">Who in the right state of mind would do such a thing?</font>

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,340
<font color="yellow">He knows Chairman Shin's condition better than anyone.</font>

69
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,610
<font color="yellow">You know he's Boo Yong Joo.</font>

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,370
<font color="yellow">Making what appears to be impossible...</font>

71
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,710
<font color="yellow">into possible is his favorite thing.</font>

72
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,810
<font color="yellow">He's more likely to proceed with it than to refuse it, don't you think?</font>

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,510
<font color="yellow">If so,</font>

74
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,410
<font color="yellow">he will be digging his own grave.</font>

75
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,710
<font color="yellow">What do you think he is doing?</font>

76
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,210
<font color="yellow">Is he considering whether or not...</font>

77
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,570
<font color="yellow">to proceed with the operation?</font>

78
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,070
<font color="yellow">It seems like he is.</font>

79
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,140
<font color="yellow">Is he going to do that?</font>

80
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,540
<font color="yellow">Or is he giving up?</font>

81
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,640
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

82
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,710
<font color="yellow">I agree with you.</font>

83
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,240
<font color="yellow">You think? I knew it.</font>

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,810
<font color="yellow">Master Kim wouldn't give things up so easily.</font>

85
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,140
<font color="yellow">If so, what is he trying to decide?</font>

86
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,010
<font color="yellow">Maybe he is busy...</font>

87
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,110
<font color="yellow">making plans for the operation.</font>

88
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,840
<font color="yellow">What you say is very plausible.</font>

89
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,170
<font color="yellow">Is he making plans for the operation?</font>

90
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,970
<font color="yellow">What kind of plans...</font>

91
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,270
<font color="yellow">is he thinking about...</font>

92
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,540
<font color="yellow">to make the operation successful?</font>

93
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,770
<font color="yellow">(CHAPTER 16, BURDEN OF RISK)</font>

94
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,440
<font color="yellow">Give him hydration.</font>

95
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,940
<font color="yellow">Once he gets better, send him to an outpatient department.</font>

96
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,710
<font color="yellow">Dr. Woo, I need to talk to you.</font>

97
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,210
<font color="yellow">Why did you call a surgeon for this?</font>

98
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,810
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
- He doesn't have severe symptoms...</font>

99
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,170
<font color="yellow">and he passes gas.</font>

100
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,140
<font color="yellow">You can handle it in the emergency room.</font>

101
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,510
<font color="yellow">He has a history of operation,</font>

102
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,440
<font color="yellow">and I found ileus on the x-ray. So I called a surgeon just in case.</font>

103
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,340
<font color="yellow">I know there is no real boundary between ER and GS in this hospital,</font>

104
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,770
<font color="yellow">but don't you think you can't call a surgeon just for everything?</font>

105
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,210
<font color="yellow">Dr. Woo Yeon Hwa.</font>

106
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,210
<font color="yellow">I heard you were a first year resident of General Surgery.</font>

107
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,310
<font color="yellow">Then you are supposed to know when to call a surgeon.</font>

108
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,970
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry, Doctor.
- Don't even be sorry.</font>

109
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,440
<font color="yellow">Just be good.</font>

110
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,410
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

111
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,640
<font color="yellow">I guess he is upset with me.</font>

112
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,470
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

113
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,640
<font color="yellow">That's because I did something wrong.</font>

114
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,640
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

115
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,510
<font color="yellow">Dr. Woo, did you just ignore my order?</font>

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,510
<font color="yellow">I told you to assist the operation, not Dr. Kang.</font>

117
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,310
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang insisted to do that.</font>

118
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,940
<font color="yellow">Are you saying Dr. Kang's order takes priority over mine?</font>

119
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,310
<font color="yellow">I can't give you an order when you act like this.</font>

120
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,440
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Doctor.</font>

121
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,940
<font color="yellow">- I should've given it more thought.
- Don't even be sorry.</font>

122
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,040
<font color="yellow">Just make sure to do your job right.</font>

123
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,670
<font color="yellow">Are you saying we should reduce more time?</font>

124
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,410
<font color="yellow">- Can't we do that?
- Will you...</font>

125
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,240
<font color="yellow">proceed with the operation?</font>

126
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,170
<font color="yellow">I'm just thinking it may be manageable.</font>

127
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,440
<font color="yellow">Only if we can finish the whole process within six hours.</font>

128
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,940
<font color="yellow">Within six hours?</font>

129
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,140
<font color="yellow">That's ridiculous. Six hours?</font>

130
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,540
<font color="yellow">This surgery usually takes at least 9 to 10 hours...</font>

131
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,510
<font color="yellow">and we reduced it down to 7 hours and 30 minutes.</font>

132
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,870
<font color="yellow">You're going to reduce it down by an hour and a half again?</font>

133
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,510
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm asking you.</font>

134
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,810
<font color="yellow">How much more time can you save from that?</font>

135
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,510
<font color="yellow">10 minutes... No, even 5 minutes is good.</font>

136
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,910
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can do that?</font>

137
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,040
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

138
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
<font color="yellow">seriously considering finishing the operation in six hours?</font>

139
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,480
<font color="yellow">Can you do it or not?</font>

140
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,670
<font color="yellow">- Six hours?
- Six hours?</font>

141
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,670
<font color="yellow">So that's what he's been trying to figure out.</font>

142
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,480
<font color="yellow">In order to finish in six hours...</font>

143
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,670
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

144
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,980
<font color="yellow">That means we can't afford to touch a single artery while...</font>

145
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,570
<font color="yellow">excoriating the tissue through sternotomy and cannulation.</font>

146
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,710
<font color="yellow">Even then, we'd barely be able to finish in time.</font>

147
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,240
<font color="yellow">Even if we do that, we won't be able to finish in six hours.</font>

148
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,110
<font color="yellow">Excoriating the tissue without touching the artery is impossible.</font>

149
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,640
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it could be possible for Master Kim, Ms. Oh?</font>

150
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,310
<font color="yellow">It's not like he's been specializing in heart surgeries.</font>

151
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,440
<font color="yellow">This will be difficult even for Master Kim. It can't be done.</font>

152
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,840
<font color="yellow">My thoughts exactly.</font>

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,640
<font color="yellow">Besides, doing the surgery...</font>

154
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,670
<font color="yellow">will not benefit Master Kim whatsoever.</font>

155
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,670
<font color="yellow">He will be criticized regardless of his success or failure.</font>

156
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,010
<font color="yellow">- Do you think so?
- That won't be all.</font>

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,840
<font color="yellow">In the case he fails, he'll take all the blame.</font>

158
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,240
<font color="yellow">I doubt that.</font>

159
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,440
<font color="yellow">Do you think President Do will leave Master Kim alone?</font>

160
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,840
<font color="yellow">He's been waiting for an opportunity to get rid of him.</font>

161
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,640
<font color="yellow">If the operation fails,</font>

162
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,740
<font color="yellow">he'll quickly grab...</font>

163
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,410
<font color="yellow">that opportunity to hold Master Kim responsible.</font>

164
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,910
<font color="yellow">Which is why we can't afford a failure.</font>

165
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,640
<font color="yellow">Failure?</font>

166
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,570
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't let that happen, then.</font>

167
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,710
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so, Dong Joo?</font>

168
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,110
<font color="yellow">The patient is a 72-year-old man with terminal lung cancer.</font>

169
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,740
<font color="yellow">Putting him under anesthesia for a long time alone...</font>

170
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,740
<font color="yellow">is a great risk.</font>

171
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,040
<font color="yellow">Which is why we shouldn't go over six hours.</font>

172
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,070
<font color="yellow">You know better than us that it's impossible.</font>

173
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,480
<font color="yellow">So what? You can't do it?</font>

174
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,410
<font color="yellow">No. I'm opposing it.</font>

175
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,110
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

176
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,510
<font color="yellow">One person opposes.</font>

177
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,240
<font color="yellow">What about you, Dr. Nam and Ms. Oh?</font>

178
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,310
<font color="yellow">Okay. You two are on hold.</font>

179
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,240
<font color="yellow">And you, Dr. Yoon? Are you against it as well?</font>

180
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,810
<font color="yellow">No. I'm in favor of it.</font>

181
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,340
<font color="yellow">- Seo Jung.
- Okay.</font>

182
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,370
<font color="yellow">One person in favor.</font>

183
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,210
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

184
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,570
<font color="yellow">You two can let me know once you make up your mind.</font>

185
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,070
<font color="yellow">If possible,</font>

186
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,440
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to be in favor.</font>

187
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,870
<font color="yellow">Until then.</font>

188
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,470
<font color="yellow">I guess he's really going to perform the surgery.</font>

189
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,670
<font color="yellow">He probably made up his mind since the beginning.</font>

190
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,240
<font color="yellow">We should be stopping him.</font>

191
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,070
<font color="yellow">How could you support his decision?</font>

192
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,340
<font color="yellow">Because it's Master Kim's decision.</font>

193
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,740
<font color="yellow">Will you die if he tells you to?</font>

194
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,210
<font color="yellow">I told him that I'd at least pretend.</font>

195
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,370
<font color="yellow">What's the reason behind it?</font>

196
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,010
<font color="yellow">What's the reason behind your implicit faith in him?</font>

197
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,070
<font color="yellow">Respect?</font>

198
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,140
<font color="yellow">If you respect him, you should've been more rational.</font>

199
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,370
<font color="yellow">The doctor you respect is about to perform a very risky surgery.</font>

200
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,310
<font color="yellow">Not only Master Kim himself,</font>

201
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,240
<font color="yellow">but he could put everyone at Doldam Hospital in trouble.</font>

202
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,940
<font color="yellow">The fact that Master Kim is so confident...</font>

203
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,040
<font color="yellow">must mean that he's gotten it pretty much figured out already.</font>

204
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,610
<font color="yellow">What if he actually finishes the operation in six hours? What then?</font>

205
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,940
<font color="yellow">It's absolutely impossible.</font>

206
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,570
<font color="yellow">I think trying to finish under six hours...</font>

207
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,540
<font color="yellow">will more likely to lead us into mistakes.</font>

208
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,070
<font color="yellow">Even after taking every variable into account...</font>

209
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,740
<font color="yellow">I really want to...</font>

210
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,740
<font color="yellow">be a part of that operation.</font>

211
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,270
<font color="yellow">It might be an operation...</font>

212
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,370
<font color="yellow">of my lifetime.</font>

213
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,840
<font color="yellow">This is a very rare case of an operation.</font>

214
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,540
<font color="yellow">More importantly, when do you think...</font>

215
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,310
<font color="yellow">I'll get another chance to witness Master Kim performing a surgery?</font>

216
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,470
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

217
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,840
<font color="yellow">But still, the risk is too high.</font>

218
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,640
<font color="yellow">I think it's a risk worth taking.</font>

219
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,170
<font color="yellow">And what if he fails?</font>

220
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,710
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to think about it.</font>

221
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,440
<font color="yellow">But even if he does fail,</font>

222
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,570
<font color="yellow">I'll be grateful...</font>

223
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,410
<font color="yellow">for that I could be a part of the process together with Master Kim.</font>

224
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,410
<font color="yellow">I think that alone has meaning.</font>

225
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,170
<font color="yellow">That lunatic.</font>

226
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,010
<font color="yellow">So are you saying he's pressing on with the operation?</font>

227
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

228
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,370
<font color="yellow">Get me the list of the staff members.</font>

229
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,710
<font color="yellow">Has Boo Yong Joo decided to perform the surgery?</font>

230
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, apparently.</font>

231
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,040
<font color="yellow">With how things are panning out,</font>

232
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,910
<font color="yellow">you'll need to come up with a plan in case of an emergency.</font>

233
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,240
<font color="yellow">- What kind of emergency?
- Chairman Shin...</font>

234
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,340
<font color="yellow">is 72 years of age. Furthermore,</font>

235
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,540
<font color="yellow">he has terminal lung cancer.</font>

236
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,140
<font color="yellow">He'll have to withstand a 8 to 9-hour-long surgery...</font>

237
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,370
<font color="yellow">under general anesthesia.</font>

238
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,840
<font color="yellow">That alone puts the operation at a very high risk.</font>

239
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,610
<font color="yellow">The operation might be successful.</font>

240
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,610
<font color="yellow">Regardless of its success or failure,</font>

241
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,270
<font color="yellow">the mere fact that he's undergoing surgery is meaningless...</font>

242
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,640
<font color="yellow">with the condition he's in.</font>

243
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,040
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

244
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,610
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't worry too much.</font>

245
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,210
<font color="yellow">I have a plan.</font>

246
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,970
<font color="yellow">I'll go to Doldam Hospital...</font>

247
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,940
<font color="yellow">and offer him two propositions.</font>

248
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,040
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come down here ever again.</font>

249
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,240
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten about what I said?</font>

250
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,970
<font color="yellow">Why come here? For what purpose?</font>

251
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,170
<font color="yellow">I just heard about Chairman Shin's surgery.</font>

252
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,310
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

253
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,810
<font color="yellow">Are you going to try to stop me again?</font>

254
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,470
<font color="yellow">That won't be possible...</font>

255
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,910
<font color="yellow">with Chairman Shin being so stubborn.</font>

256
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,970
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about supporting you...</font>

257
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,510
<font color="yellow">so you can do it properly.</font>

258
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,540
<font color="yellow">- Support me?
- Let's start by...</font>

259
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,110
<font color="yellow">replacing all of your staff members.</font>

260
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,370
<font color="yellow">What is this nonsense I'm hearing?</font>

261
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,970
<font color="yellow">Just to be clear,</font>

262
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,370
<font color="yellow">this wasn't my order.</font>

263
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,610
<font color="yellow">It's a request made by Director Shin.</font>

264
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,710
<font color="yellow">Consider yourself informed.</font>

265
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

266
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,710
<font color="yellow">The staff members are to be replaced with the staff from Geodae Hospital?</font>

267
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,640
<font color="yellow">President Do came down here to say that in person?</font>

268
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,270
<font color="yellow">Yes. On top of that, he said that it wasn't his order.</font>

269
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,740
<font color="yellow">It was a request made by Chairman Shin's daughter.</font>

270
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,740
<font color="yellow">The staff members will be replaced?</font>

271
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,340
<font color="yellow">With the staff from Geodae Hospital?</font>

272
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,870
<font color="yellow">Yes. President Do came here and said that in person.</font>

273
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,310
<font color="yellow">I understand. I'll get down there.</font>

274
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

275
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,810
<font color="yellow">You too know that...</font>

276
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,870
<font color="yellow">Geodae Hospital is famous for its thoracic surgery department.</font>

277
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,110
<font color="yellow">Do you want experienced staff?</font>

278
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,970
<font color="yellow">Or young and skilled fellow doctors?</font>

279
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,140
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

280
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,740
<font color="yellow">You'll need an anesthesiologist as well.</font>

281
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,810
<font color="yellow">I took a look at the list of your staff members.</font>

282
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,340
<font color="yellow">I saw Dr. Nam's name on it.</font>

283
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,270
<font color="yellow">Letting someone in a medical lawsuit to be in charge of...</font>

284
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,070
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin's anesthesia is... How should I say this?</font>

285
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,640
<font color="yellow">I don't like it.</font>

286
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,610
<font color="yellow">It's not like it was a simple medical accident.</font>

287
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,410
<font color="yellow">It involved someone dying.</font>

288
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,040
<font color="yellow">Oh, there's something else. I'll also send you...</font>

289
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,410
<font color="yellow">two skilled scrub nurses.</font>

290
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,340
<font color="yellow">They're on a whole another level...</font>

291
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,310
<font color="yellow">compared to nurses at a cottage hospital.</font>

292
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,240
<font color="yellow">Look at you all yapping about.</font>

293
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,040
<font color="yellow">Will you shut your mouth before or after I punch you?</font>

294
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,140
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

295
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,910
<font color="yellow">I'm doing you a favor out of kindness.</font>

296
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to tell you this,</font>

297
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,510
<font color="yellow">but nobody else other than my own staff members can be in my OR.</font>

298
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,110
<font color="yellow">A request made by Director Shin?</font>

299
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,840
<font color="yellow">What a joke.</font>

300
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,010
<font color="yellow">Go back and tell her that I don't care about what she says.</font>

301
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,110
<font color="yellow">Your staff members...</font>

302
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,310
<font color="yellow">are all a bunch of people with disqualifications.</font>

303
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,270
<font color="yellow">In case that the operation doesn't go well,</font>

304
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,410
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't want room for controversy.</font>

305
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,510
<font color="yellow">Hey, President Do.</font>

306
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,040
<font color="yellow">I just need you to stay out of my way.</font>

307
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,180
<font color="yellow">Then, there won't be any problems.</font>

308
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,570
<font color="yellow">If you can't change the staff,</font>

309
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,470
<font color="yellow">you have to accept another offer.</font>

310
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,810
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you'll be okay?</font>

311
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,740
<font color="yellow">Another offer?</font>

312
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,340
<font color="yellow">What another offer?</font>

313
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,070
<font color="yellow">Live surgery.</font>

314
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,140
<font color="yellow">Live surgery?</font>

315
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,440
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

316
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,040
<font color="yellow">They'll perform my surgery in front of an audience?</font>

317
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,810
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

318
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,910
<font color="yellow">Whose idea is this?</font>

319
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,110
<font color="yellow">Is this from President Do?</font>

320
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,210
<font color="yellow">The ones watching the surgery are...</font>

321
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,210
<font color="yellow">people from the hospital, me,</font>

322
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,610
<font color="yellow">and cardiothoracic surgeons of Geodae Hospital.</font>

323
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,180
<font color="yellow">I think I'd feel safer...</font>

324
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,740
<font color="yellow">if I watch and see if your surgery is going well.</font>

325
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,840
<font color="yellow">Please, say yes.</font>

326
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,740
<font color="yellow">Choose one.</font>

327
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,970
<font color="yellow">Change your staff members,</font>

328
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,610
<font color="yellow">or choose to go with live surgery.</font>

329
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,680
<font color="yellow">If you choose to do the live surgery,</font>

330
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,310
<font color="yellow">all the cardiothoracic surgeons from Geodae Hospital will come...</font>

331
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,870
<font color="yellow">and observe the operation.</font>

332
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,570
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

333
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,140
<font color="yellow">What will you choose?</font>

334
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,510
<font color="yellow">Will you change your staff members?</font>

335
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,340
<font color="yellow">Boo Yong Joo...</font>

336
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,540
<font color="yellow">won't change his staff members.</font>

337
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,440
<font color="yellow">Will you choose to do a live surgery?</font>

338
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,070
<font color="yellow">What happens...</font>

339
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,970
<font color="yellow">if he chooses to go live?</font>

340
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,740
<font color="yellow">Like I said,</font>

341
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
<font color="yellow">it'll be like digging up...</font>

342
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,810
<font color="yellow">his own grave.</font>

343
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,680
<font color="yellow">Which one will you choose?</font>

344
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,070
<font color="yellow">Will you change your staff members?</font>

345
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,470
<font color="yellow">Or will you do live surgery?</font>

346
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,010
<font color="yellow">What kind of an awful man is he?</font>

347
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,840
<font color="yellow">How can he ask you to choose between the two?</font>

348
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,040
<font color="yellow">What kind of a threat is this? Isn't that right, Master Kim?</font>

349
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,470
<font color="yellow">Well, we can't say that it's just a threat.</font>

350
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,510
<font color="yellow">This operation is so rare...</font>

351
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,840
<font color="yellow">that Geodae Hospital would want to take a part in this.</font>

352
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,570
<font color="yellow">But his intention isn't so innocent!</font>

353
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,010
<font color="yellow">To be frank,</font>

354
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,810
<font color="yellow">that just means he wants to keep his eyes on our operation.</font>

355
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,740
<font color="yellow">Also, why did he have to pry...</font>

356
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,540
<font color="yellow">into Dr. Nam's medical litigation?</font>

357
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,680
<font color="yellow">On top of that,</font>

358
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,740
<font color="yellow">he called me an old nurse who only works at the cottage hospital.</font>

359
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,510
<font color="yellow">He didn't say you were old.</font>

360
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,710
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

361
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,810
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I am...</font>

362
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,440
<font color="yellow">deeply offended, Master Kim.</font>

363
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,470
<font color="yellow">I believe you should turn down both conditions from President Do.</font>

364
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,410
<font color="yellow">I have another idea, Ms. Oh.</font>

365
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,640
<font color="yellow">This can be a chance for us.</font>

366
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,870
<font color="yellow">This isn't a chance!</font>

367
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,710
<font color="yellow">Is this our chance to be angry?</font>

368
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,680
<font color="yellow">It's a chance for us...</font>

369
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,370
<font color="yellow">to show the world how good of a surgeon Master Kim is.</font>

370
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,240
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Master Kim?</font>

371
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,270
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Well...</font>

372
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,040
<font color="yellow">Why don't you change your staff members?</font>

373
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,180
<font color="yellow">Like President Do mentioned,</font>

374
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,470
<font color="yellow">we shouldn't leave any room for a dispute.</font>

375
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,940
<font color="yellow">The verdict isn't out,</font>

376
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,940
<font color="yellow">but it is true that I am in the middle of a litigation.</font>

377
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,970
<font color="yellow">If the surgery goes wrong by any chance,</font>

378
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
<font color="yellow">my situation...</font>

379
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,540
<font color="yellow">can affect you in a bad way.</font>

380
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,340
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam.</font>

381
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,740
<font color="yellow">We can't be a burden to Master Kim, Ms. Oh.</font>

382
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,470
<font color="yellow">We have to think about how we can help...</font>

383
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,540
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

384
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,070
<font color="yellow">I'll reduce five minutes from my part.</font>

385
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,370
<font color="yellow">Do you think that'll help?</font>

386
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,510
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

387
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,640
<font color="yellow">You are in.</font>

388
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,740
<font color="yellow">Two of you agreed including Dr. Yoon.</font>

389
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,170
<font color="yellow">What about Dr. Nam and Ms. Oh?</font>

390
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

391
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,710
<font color="yellow">Are you still undecided?</font>

392
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,910
<font color="yellow">Master Kim, please hear me out.</font>

393
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,810
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense.</font>

394
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,870
<font color="yellow">Let's do what we always do.</font>

395
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,570
<font color="yellow">That's how you can help me.</font>

396
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,640
<font color="yellow">But Master Kim.</font>

397
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,440
<font color="yellow">I have no one else to depend on if you are not there.</font>

398
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,510
<font color="yellow">If I have someone else in the operation room,</font>

399
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,270
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to focus because I'll be more nervous.</font>

400
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,870
<font color="yellow">If I can't focus,</font>

401
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,670
<font color="yellow">the operation time will be delayed.</font>

402
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,170
<font color="yellow">I can't even miss a minute now.</font>

403
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,170
<font color="yellow">Do you think I should waste my time like that?</font>

404
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,810
<font color="yellow">And you too, Ms. Oh.</font>

405
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,140
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting so angry...</font>

406
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,170
<font color="yellow">at President Do's nonsense?</font>

407
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,170
<font color="yellow">The only scrub nurse...</font>

408
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,040
<font color="yellow">who can work up to my speed is...</font>

409
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,010
<font color="yellow">just you, Ms. Oh.</font>

410
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,870
<font color="yellow">And you already know that.</font>

411
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,040
<font color="yellow">Well, yes.</font>

412
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,470
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

413
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,110
<font color="yellow">I thought I could do this under six hours...</font>

414
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,810
<font color="yellow">because I knew...</font>

415
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,840
<font color="yellow">I would be doing the operation...</font>

416
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,940
<font color="yellow">with the staff right here.</font>

417
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,610
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

418
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,140
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam, should I state out...</font>

419
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,010
<font color="yellow">the obvious like this?</font>

420
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,040
<font color="yellow">Should I be doing this, Ms. Oh?</font>

421
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,740
<font color="yellow">It sounds warm and nice.</font>

422
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,870
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

423
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,440
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam and Ms. Oh.</font>

424
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,740
<font color="yellow">Will you join the operation or not?</font>

425
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,870
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

426
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,610
<font color="yellow">I'll be there.</font>

427
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,470
<font color="yellow">I'm the only scrub nurse who can work at your speed.</font>

428
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,540
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam.</font>

429
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,140
<font color="yellow">- What about you?
- Are you really okay..</font>

430
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,570
<font color="yellow">With doing this live?</font>

431
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,740
<font color="yellow">You are so frustrating.</font>

432
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
<font color="yellow">President Do.</font>

433
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,540
<font color="yellow">Let's do live surgery.</font>

434
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,640
<font color="yellow">Satisfied?</font>

435
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
<font color="yellow">Satisfied?</font>

436
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,210
<font color="yellow">It's just as I thought.</font>

437
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,010
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

438
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,370
<font color="yellow">He has...</font>

439
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,510
<font color="yellow">chosen to do live surgery.</font>

440
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,940
<font color="yellow">Our next step is...</font>

441
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,540
<font color="yellow">to destroy him for good.</font>

442
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,310
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

443
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,610
<font color="yellow">when is the operation?</font>

444
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,070
<font color="yellow">In five days.</font>

445
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,510
<font color="yellow">We'll start at 9am.</font>

446
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,310
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

447
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,570
<font color="yellow">I heard my daughter...</font>

448
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,910
<font color="yellow">asked for something troublesome.</font>

449
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,970
<font color="yellow">I don't mind.</font>

450
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,140
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if I go live or not.</font>

451
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,740
<font color="yellow">I'm only concerned about...</font>

452
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,110
<font color="yellow">reducing the operation time.</font>

453
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,970
<font color="yellow">That's my only concern.</font>

454
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,910
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Master Kim.</font>

455
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,470
<font color="yellow">I'll hear that...</font>

456
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,710
<font color="yellow">after the operation, Sir.</font>

457
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,740
<font color="yellow">You have made a difficult decision.</font>

458
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,510
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll do well.</font>

459
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,170
<font color="yellow">Well, I know that you will.</font>

460
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,940
<font color="yellow">Is there...</font>

461
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,570
<font color="yellow">anything that Chairman Shin has not shared with me?</font>

462
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,440
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

463
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,670
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

464
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,740
<font color="yellow">it seems like he's hiding something.</font>

465
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,870
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if that has something to do with the operation.</font>

466
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,370
<font color="yellow">Do you know anything?</font>

467
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,570
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

468
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,010
<font color="yellow">He has told me not to say anything to you.</font>

469
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,370
<font color="yellow">So there is something.</font>

470
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,110
<font color="yellow">You can hear it from him...</font>

471
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,310
<font color="yellow">after the operation.</font>

472
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,740
<font color="yellow">We only have five days...</font>

473
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,270
<font color="yellow">to prepare.</font>

474
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,710
<font color="yellow">Our task is...</font>

475
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,740
<font color="yellow">to figure out...</font>

476
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,270
<font color="yellow">where we can reduce an hour and 30 minutes.</font>

477
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,370
<font color="yellow">It's an hour and 25 minutes.</font>

478
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,670
<font color="yellow">I already reduced five minutes from my part.</font>

479
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,410
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Yoon.
- Yes, Master Kim.</font>

480
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,070
<font color="yellow">Make sure you study his CT scan...</font>

481
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,810
<font color="yellow">and find out where you will perform cannulation.</font>

482
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,110
<font color="yellow">Wait, no.</font>

483
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,840
<font color="yellow">Put the CT scan in your head and memorize it.</font>

484
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

485
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,670
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh and Mr. Park.</font>

486
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,640
<font color="yellow">Could you check and see if we can reduce any time...</font>

487
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,370
<font color="yellow">while circulating in the operation?</font>

488
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,840
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes, Master Kim.</font>

489
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,410
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Kang.
- Yes?</font>

490
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,910
<font color="yellow">Make sure you finish your part within 25 minutes.</font>

491
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,840
<font color="yellow">- Keep your time, okay?
- Yes, Master Kim.</font>

492
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,910
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

493
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,510
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam.</font>

494
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,210
<font color="yellow">Let's prepare this well for the next five days.</font>

495
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,340
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes, Master Kim.</font>

496
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,370
<font color="yellow">Tell all cardiothoracic surgeons to be here in 10 minutes.</font>

497
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,940
<font color="yellow">- No exceptions. All of them!
- Yes, President Do.</font>

498
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,210
<font color="yellow">The aorta is close to the sternum. Do you see that?</font>

499
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,010
<font color="yellow">The space is too small.</font>

500
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,470
<font color="yellow">One false move...</font>

501
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,870
<font color="yellow">and you could cut the heart or the aorta.</font>

502
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,140
<font color="yellow">What should we do...</font>

503
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,570
<font color="yellow">in case we can't cannulate the aorta?</font>

504
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,310
<font color="yellow">We should cannulate the aorta femoralis.</font>

505
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,310
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

506
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,210
<font color="yellow">Once the operation begins, make sure to disinfect the aorta femoralis.</font>

507
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,210
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

508
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,240
<font color="yellow">Dr. Jin. Liaise with the live shooting team.</font>

509
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,740
<font color="yellow">- Yes, President Do.
- It starts at 9am.</font>

510
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,210
<font color="yellow">So you should be there at least one hour earlier.</font>

511
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,440
<font color="yellow">- Yes, President Do.
- Yes, President Do.</font>

512
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,570
<font color="yellow">(DOCTOR'S OFFICE)</font>

513
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,810
<font color="yellow">Bring me the suture set.</font>

514
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

515
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,270
<font color="yellow">You are not busy, are you?</font>

516
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,370
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Were you talking to me?</font>

517
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,310
<font color="yellow">- There is no one else but you.
- Okay.</font>

518
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,410
<font color="yellow">If you are not busy, come assist me with the suture.</font>

519
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,570
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

520
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,970
<font color="yellow">Short for subcutaneous and long for skin, you know that, right?</font>

521
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know.</font>

522
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,310
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

523
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,640
<font color="yellow">Were you really a resident in GS? You are not doing it right.</font>

524
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,540
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was too nervous.</font>

525
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,640
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

526
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,710
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Make it shorter.</font>

527
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,470
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

528
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,440
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- I told you to be good, not sorry.</font>

529
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,370
<font color="yellow">Wipe up the blood, too.</font>

530
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,810
<font color="yellow">Am I bleeding?</font>

531
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,010
<font color="yellow">Please don't move.</font>

532
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,540
<font color="yellow">Blood gathers...</font>

533
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,940
<font color="yellow">when the needle goes into the wound.</font>

534
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

535
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,310
<font color="yellow">Let me do that.</font>

536
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,010
<font color="yellow">Please go check the other patients. I can take care of this.</font>

537
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,540
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

538
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,370
<font color="yellow">He just asked you to go check the other patients.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

544
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,870
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

545
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,170
<font color="yellow">Did something happen between Master Kim and you?</font>

546
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,570
<font color="yellow">You are not attending the conference...</font>

547
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,570
<font color="yellow">and Master Kim is not talking to you.</font>

548
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,510
<font color="yellow">Did something happen after we fought?</font>

549
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,940
<font color="yellow">You even left the team.</font>

550
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,310
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened.</font>

551
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,710
<font color="yellow">I just told him that I didn't want to join it.</font>

552
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,740
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You begged Master Kim to let you be the first assistant.</font>

553
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,740
<font color="yellow">Why did you change your mind?</font>

554
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,740
<font color="yellow">When did I do that?</font>

555
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,140
<font color="yellow">I didn't beg him to let me be the first assistant.</font>

556
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,670
<font color="yellow">Did Master Kim tell you that?</font>

557
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,310
<font color="yellow">I just overheard it.</font>

558
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,710
<font color="yellow">Why did you change your mind?</font>

559
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,410
<font color="yellow">I told you. I just don't want to do it.</font>

560
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,110
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

561
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,870
<font color="yellow">I thought the operation was about replacing batteries,</font>

562
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,710
<font color="yellow">but it became too complicated.</font>

563
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,610
<font color="yellow">And I don't have an important position.</font>

564
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,840
<font color="yellow">What if you can change the position?</font>

565
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,510
<font color="yellow">Do you want to join the team again?</font>

566
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,970
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

567
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,210
<font color="yellow">I have to cut the surgical time down from 30 minutes to 25.</font>

568
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,670
<font color="yellow">If I do that with you,</font>

569
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,840
<font color="yellow">I think we can save five more minutes.</font>

570
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,840
<font color="yellow">I will replace the batteries, and you will replace the controller.</font>

571
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,010
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

572
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,040
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me a favor?</font>

573
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,410
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- I...</font>

574
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,370
<font color="yellow">just want to cut down the surgical time.</font>

575
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,740
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

576
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,510
<font color="yellow">For a general surgeon, it is a great chance to expand your experiences.</font>

577
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,310
<font color="yellow">Just having your name on the operation will have...</font>

578
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,970
<font color="yellow">a huge influence on your career.</font>

579
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,570
<font color="yellow">Now that we are doing it, it will be even better if it ends successfully.</font>

580
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,470
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

581
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,870
<font color="yellow">Do you want to join me?</font>

582
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,570
<font color="yellow">I will replace the batteries, and you will replace the controller.</font>

583
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,740
<font color="yellow">I'm in.</font>

584
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

585
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,010
<font color="yellow">In Beom.</font>

586
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,670
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you can do that in 20 minutes?</font>

587
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,840
<font color="yellow">I want you to have...</font>

588
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,470
<font color="yellow">In Beom join the team again.</font>

589
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,310
<font color="yellow">If we work together,</font>

590
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,870
<font color="yellow">we can finish it in 20 minutes.</font>

591
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,140
<font color="yellow">It includes suture process, too.</font>

592
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

593
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,040
<font color="yellow">Okay. In Beom is in.</font>

594
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,010
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

595
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,670
<font color="yellow">I will have the same.</font>

596
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,270
<font color="yellow">I heard an interesting rumor.</font>

597
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,740
<font color="yellow">Is Dr. Boo Yong Joo coming back?</font>

598
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,940
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

599
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,810
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid so.</font>

600
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,840
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's okay?</font>

601
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,210
<font color="yellow">I tried to stop him,</font>

602
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,140
<font color="yellow">but Chairman Shin was too firm about that.</font>

603
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,470
<font color="yellow">Is he replacing Chairman Shin's artificial heart?</font>

604
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,310
<font color="yellow">If the operation proves to be a success,</font>

605
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,010
<font color="yellow">you will be in trouble.</font>

606
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,340
<font color="yellow">How can such an immoral person like him succeed?</font>

607
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,740
<font color="yellow">That's just ridiculous.</font>

608
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,870
<font color="yellow">It will just dispirit...</font>

609
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,440
<font color="yellow">innocent hard-working people like us.</font>

610
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,440
<font color="yellow">That's not how the world is supposed to work.</font>

611
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,210
<font color="yellow">Why don't you...</font>

612
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,240
<font color="yellow">take the opportunity...</font>

613
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,510
<font color="yellow">to realize justice?</font>

614
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,810
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

615
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,110
<font color="yellow">I'm just going home.</font>

616
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,840
<font color="yellow">- What about you?
- I'm going home, too.</font>

617
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,610
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there a problem?</font>

618
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,740
<font color="yellow">You don't have to go home together though.</font>

619
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,710
<font color="yellow">What's the matter? We are going the same way.</font>

620
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,010
<font color="yellow">Do you live in the same neighborhood?</font>

621
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,240
<font color="yellow">We live in the same house.</font>

622
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,910
<font color="yellow">In the same house? Do you live together?</font>

623
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,740
<font color="yellow">Yes. We live together in the company house. Why?</font>

624
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,710
<font color="yellow">You should have told me that.</font>

625
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,370
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me sooner?</font>

626
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,510
<font color="yellow">I thought you already knew.</font>

627
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,710
<font color="yellow">Most of the hospital employees live in the company house.</font>

628
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,710
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that?</font>

629
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,410
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

630
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,940
<font color="yellow">Where did you think I was staying?</font>

631
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,870
<font color="yellow">I didn't even think about that.</font>

632
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,710
<font color="yellow">And I didn't even imagine that you two would sleep together.</font>

633
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,110
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung, wait for me.</font>

634
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,640
<font color="yellow">I'm going home with you.</font>

635
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,080
<font color="yellow">Why? You don't like the company house.</font>

636
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,470
<font color="yellow">You said you liked the staff room better.</font>

637
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,140
<font color="yellow">I changed my mind.</font>

638
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,740
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

639
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,110
<font color="yellow">Don't move an inch.</font>

640
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,740
<font color="yellow">Are you two going home?</font>

641
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,240
<font color="yellow">Yes. Are you going home, too?</font>

642
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,170
<font color="yellow">I'm a little nervous about the operation tomorrow.</font>

643
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,080
<font color="yellow">I'd better go home early and get some rest.</font>

644
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,110
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

645
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,210
<font color="yellow">What is that? Is it the prayer book?</font>

646
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,510
<font color="yellow">There will be...</font>

647
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,870
<font color="yellow">Wednesday service tonight.</font>

648
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,240
<font color="yellow">For the historic operation tomorrow,</font>

649
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,580
<font color="yellow">I should say my prayers.</font>

650
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,940
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Since when did you do that?</font>

651
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,310
<font color="yellow">Since last Sunday.</font>

652
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,910
<font color="yellow">I may not look like that, but I'm a believer.</font>

653
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,510
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung.</font>

654
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,240
<font color="yellow">Do you want to grab a bite to eat at Dr. Nam's restaurant?</font>

655
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,010
<font color="yellow">A glass of beer will be fine as well.</font>

656
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
<font color="yellow">Beer?</font>

657
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,710
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I'll have to say no since the operation is coming up.</font>

658
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,640
<font color="yellow">Let's drink after everything is over.</font>

659
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,440
<font color="yellow">Instead, why don't we go to Dr. Nam's place for some ramyeon?</font>

660
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,840
<font color="yellow">- Ramyeon?
- That's good, too.</font>

661
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,740
<font color="yellow">I forgot to do something.</font>

662
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,410
<font color="yellow">Go on without me.</font>

663
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,710
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Seo Jung.
- Okay.</font>

664
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,870
<font color="yellow">With the weather so cold...</font>

665
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,940
<font color="yellow">some ramyeon will be so good.</font>

666
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,470
<font color="yellow">And a glass of beer with that would be...</font>

667
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

668
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,470
<font color="yellow">Did she leave already?</font>

669
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,740
<font color="yellow">Manager Jang. Have you seen Seo Jung?</font>

670
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,470
<font color="yellow">I know where she went.</font>

671
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,510
<font color="yellow">(PRAYER BOOK)</font>

672
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,670
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

673
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,510
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

674
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,440
<font color="yellow">- For Master Kim!
- For Master Kim!</font>

675
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,410
<font color="yellow">- For the artificial heart!
- For the artificial heart!</font>

676
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,510
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

677
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,510
<font color="yellow">I feel really bad.</font>

678
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,870
<font color="yellow">I happen to be the only one who doesn't need to operate.</font>

679
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,040
<font color="yellow">Instead of a blessing from the above,</font>

680
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,740
<font color="yellow">you're celebrating with beer.</font>

681
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't talk like that.</font>

682
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,940
<font color="yellow">I thought you didn't go to church before.</font>

683
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,210
<font color="yellow">Did you start going lately?</font>

684
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,470
<font color="yellow">The last time you went to...</font>

685
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,640
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right.</font>

686
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,710
<font color="yellow">There was that newly possessed shaman.</font>

687
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,910
<font color="yellow">That lustful female shaman.</font>

688
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh, stop intervening...</font>

689
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,910
<font color="yellow">in my religious life.</font>

690
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,270
<font color="yellow">That's private.</font>

691
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,080
<font color="yellow">Sure, whatever you say.</font>

692
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,870
<font color="yellow">All right. This is your order of budaejjigae with extra noodles.</font>

693
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,670
<font color="yellow">Ramyeon is coming soon as well.</font>

694
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,670
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Enjoy.</font>

695
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

696
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,970
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

697
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,440
<font color="yellow">I've never heard about Dr. Nam's medical litigation before.</font>

698
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,540
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you about it?</font>

699
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,340
<font color="yellow">Later.</font>

700
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,840
<font color="yellow">You have a big surgery tomorrow.</font>

701
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,640
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about that some other time, Dr. Kang.</font>

702
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,580
<font color="yellow">Okay. I understand.</font>

703
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,010
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

704
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,370
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang and Dr. Yoon...</font>

705
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,970
<font color="yellow">look beautiful together every time I see you.</font>

706
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,310
<font color="yellow">Aren't they like a couple of hospital bugs?</font>

707
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,080
<font color="yellow">Bugs.</font>

708
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,170
<font color="yellow">I'm asking just to be sure.</font>

709
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,470
<font color="yellow">I know the possibility is like the Earth colliding with...</font>

710
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,810
<font color="yellow">a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy,</font>

711
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,040
<font color="yellow">but I'm only asking just to be sure.</font>

712
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,870
<font color="yellow">Are you two...</font>

713
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,810
<font color="yellow">dating?</font>

714
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,140
<font color="yellow">Is it true?</font>

715
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,740
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

716
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,710
<font color="yellow">We're not.</font>

717
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,080
<font color="yellow">We're really not.</font>

718
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,840
<font color="yellow">Why would you think that?</font>

719
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,310
<font color="yellow">I've known him for a long time. That's why we seem close.</font>

720
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,310
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you?</font>

721
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,170
<font color="yellow">When he came to work as an intern at the ER five years ago,</font>

722
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,580
<font color="yellow">he used to be my underling.</font>

723
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,640
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Dong Joo?</font>

724
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,110
<font color="yellow">It is true.</font>

725
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,080
<font color="yellow">You were the arrogant,</font>

726
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,970
<font color="yellow">- untouchable intern.
- I love you, Seo Jung.</font>

727
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,310
<font color="yellow">I love you, Ms. Oh.</font>

728
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,170
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

729
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,740
<font color="yellow">I love you, Manager Jang.</font>

730
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,740
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam. I love you.</font>

731
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

732
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,710
<font color="yellow">You know how it is.</font>

733
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,140
<font color="yellow">We love each other and care for each other.</font>

734
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,740
<font color="yellow">What we have as Doldam Family...</font>

735
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,910
<font color="yellow">is thicker than water.</font>

736
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,940
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Seo Jung?</font>

737
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,610
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam. Ramyeon please.</font>

738
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,510
<font color="yellow">Right. Okay.</font>

739
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,970
<font color="yellow">Oh, I forgot kimchi.</font>

740
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,970
<font color="yellow">I should drink some more beer.</font>

741
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,440
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I feel so thirsty.</font>

742
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:21,940
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

743
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,640
<font color="yellow">- What do you think you're doing?
- It's thrilling, isn't it?</font>

744
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,410
<font color="yellow">You can expect more of it.</font>

745
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,580
<font color="yellow">There will be more.</font>

746
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,810
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die from the cold or from my beating?</font>

747
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,410
<font color="yellow">It's too cold to die outside.</font>

748
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,410
<font color="yellow">And it'll hurt to get beaten by you.</font>

749
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

750
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh, please.</font>

751
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,610
<font color="yellow">They are dating for sure.</font>

752
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,140
<font color="yellow">They really are.</font>

753
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,670
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure of it.
- I agree.</font>

754
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,410
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

755
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,470
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

756
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,870
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

757
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,040
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for you.</font>

758
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,940
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- I...</font>

759
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,510
<font color="yellow">will be going into the operating room tomorrow.</font>

760
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,440
<font color="yellow">So I've heard. And?</font>

761
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,040
<font color="yellow">This time, it's not because of my father.</font>

762
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,910
<font color="yellow">Based on pure intentions to reduce the surgical time,</font>

763
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,940
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo asked me to.</font>

764
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,740
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm going in there.</font>

765
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,370
<font color="yellow">I don't want you...</font>

766
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,140
<font color="yellow">to take things the wrong way.</font>

767
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,510
<font color="yellow">You have 20 minutes.</font>

768
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,740
<font color="yellow">If you don't perform...</font>

769
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,340
<font color="yellow">or if you don't finish in 20 minutes,</font>

770
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,540
<font color="yellow">I'll chop your hand off.</font>

00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,140
<font color="yellow">Hold this.</font>

907
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,310

908
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,640

921
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,140
<font color="yellow">In order to finish in six hours... Hold on.</font>

922
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,370
