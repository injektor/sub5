5
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:38,416

13
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:14,046

<font color="yellow">Ulcer perforation?</font>

15
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:18,956
<font color="yellow">Who told you to notify of a patient that way?</font>

18
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:25,516

20
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:30,316
<font color="yellow">He has no special medical history. According to ROS...</font>

21
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:31,786
<font color="yellow">Are you presenting a case or what?</font>

22
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:33,846
<font color="yellow">So what's his condition at this moment?</font>

23
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,146
<font color="yellow">He's showing abdominal rigidity...</font>

24
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:37,346
<font color="yellow">and severe tenderness.</font>

25
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:40,786
<font color="yellow">I did a CT scan as I couldn't find out the cause.</font>

26

28
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,986
<font color="yellow">It is ulcer perforation. He needs an operation right now.</font>

29
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,016
<font color="yellow">How are things going there? Did they start cannulation?</font>

30
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,016
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

31
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,216
<font color="yellow">I will operate on the patient with perforation. You stay there.</font>

32
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,346
<font color="yellow">I can't finish the whole procedure...</font>

33
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:01,716

34
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,516
<font color="yellow">It's already been delayed by 10 minutes with the damaged aorta.</font>

35
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:08,016
<font color="yellow">It can no longer be delayed.</font>

36
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:10,046
<font color="yellow">But this patient can't wait until then.</font>

37
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:12,616
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong, it may lead to sepsis.</font>

38
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,516
<font color="yellow">They are still working on vessel dissection here.</font>

39
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:17,646
<font color="yellow">It'll take about 1 hour and 10 minutes until they have...</font>

40

<font color="yellow">the heart-lung machine connected.</font>

<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - Within that time,</font>

44
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,516
<font color="yellow">we can operate on the patient with ulcer perforation.</font>

45
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,086
<font color="yellow">If we work together.</font>

46
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,216
<font color="yellow">Laparoscopy or open?</font>

47
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:36,216
<font color="yellow">If we find the perforation quickly, it will be easier with laparoscopy.</font>

48
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:39,716
<font color="yellow">But if not, we will have to cut the abdomen open.</font>

49
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:42,086
<font color="yellow">We don't have time to take a risk.</font>

50

00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:34,986
<font color="yellow">I do apologize that he can't make any time for you all today.</font>

316
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:37,616
<font color="yellow">Please do return to your posts. Thank you for understanding.</font>

317
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:39,586
<font color="yellow">- Doctor! - Open the door!</font>

318
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:41,986
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will let you see him.</font>

319
00:26:41,986 --> 00:26:43,146
<font color="yellow">Please return to your seats.</font>

320
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:54,146
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

321
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:58,046
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

322
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:00,516
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry to intrude.</font>

323
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,246
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

324
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:05,516
<font color="yellow">First of all, I'd like to congratulate you...</font>

325
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:06,686
<font color="yellow">for a successful operation.</font>

326
00:27:06,786 --> 00:27:09,786
<font color="yellow">It was such a touching live operation.</font>

327
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,416
<font color="yellow">Master Kim, you truly are good.</font>

328
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:13,886
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

329
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,716
<font color="yellow">What's the occasion?</font>

330
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:19,816
<font color="yellow">Oh, well. It's...</font>

331
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:22,346
<font color="yellow">There is someone here...</font>

332
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,646
<font color="yellow">who wants to interview you...</font>

333
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:27,146
<font color="yellow">about this special artificial heart operation.</font>

334
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,316
<font color="yellow">No, thanks.</font>

335
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:32,016
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. Could you do this for the publicity of...</font>

336
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,086
<font color="yellow">of Doldam Hospital and yourself?</font>

337
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,846
<font color="yellow">No, I don't talk to any reporter.</font>

338
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:39,086
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

339
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:42,516
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry a mere reporter like me came to bother you.</font>

340
00:27:42,886 --> 00:27:45,886
<font color="yellow">Mr. Oh, you said you'll walk in when I give you the sign.</font>

341
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:47,046
<font color="yellow">You can't do this.</font>

342
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,446
<font color="yellow">It's been a while, Dr. Boo.</font>

343
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:57,786
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you since Jang Hyeon Joo's incident, right?</font>

344
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:17,286
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

345
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:20,486
<font color="yellow">I think it's infection. He has a 38℃ fever.</font>

346
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,216
<font color="yellow">Ms. Cho.</font>

347
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:24,816
<font color="yellow">Check his vital signs...</font>

348
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:25,846
<font color="yellow">and give him propacetamol.</font>

349
00:28:25,846 --> 00:28:26,916
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dr. Yoon.</font>

350
00:28:27,516 --> 00:28:30,646
<font color="yellow">Go and have a meal. I will stay here.</font>

351
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:31,846
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

352
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:34,486
<font color="yellow">I heard you skipped breakfast.</font>

353
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:35,716
<font color="yellow">You should eat something.</font>

354
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:37,886
<font color="yellow">You will be working at night, too.</font>

355
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:40,986
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

356
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:55,716
<font color="yellow">Did you call me?</font>

357
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:59,346
<font color="yellow">What's the difference between chest PA and chest AP?</font>

358
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:01,986
<font color="yellow">They are taken in different positions.</font>

359
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:04,846
<font color="yellow">PA is taken in a standing position and AP is taken in a lying position.</font>

360
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:08,116
<font color="yellow">What should you do with the patient with ulcer perforation, then?</font>

361
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,746
<font color="yellow">In a standing position.</font>

362
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:11,716
<font color="yellow">Then is it PA or AP?</font>

363
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:13,346
<font color="yellow">Of course it is PA.</font>

364
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,616
<font color="yellow">Is this PA or AP?</font>

365
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:21,616
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

366
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:24,586
<font color="yellow">This is AP.</font>

367
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:27,146
<font color="yellow">And you reported me that there was no free air.</font>

368
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:29,346
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

369
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:32,386
<font color="yellow">I made a mistake giving an order.</font>

370
00:29:32,386 --> 00:29:33,646
<font color="yellow">I told you to be good, not sorry.</font>

371
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,886
<font color="yellow">- I told you to be good. - I'm sorry.</font>

372
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:45,846
<font color="yellow">- I will do it right from now on. - That's it. Just go.</font>

373
00:30:02,646 --> 00:30:04,046
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you went too far?</font>

374
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,886
<font color="yellow">- What? - I know she made a mistake,</font>

375
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:08,816
<font color="yellow">but you didn't have to rebuke her.</font>

376
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:11,016
<font color="yellow">It's not that Dr. Woo made a wrong diagnosis or something.</font>

377
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:13,016
<font color="yellow">She notified you of the ulcer perforation,</font>

378
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:15,786
<font color="yellow">and had the patient undergo an operation before it was too late.</font>

379
00:30:15,886 --> 00:30:16,916
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park.</font>

380
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:20,986
<font color="yellow">You are just picking on everything she does.</font>

381
00:30:21,146 --> 00:30:22,716
<font color="yellow">You are not just pointing out her mistakes.</font>

382
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,386
<font color="yellow">You keep insulting her character.</font>

383
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:30,086
<font color="yellow">I'm saying it's too much and I can't watch it anymore.</font>

384
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:32,946
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Park. - Excuse me, Mr. Park.</font>

385
00:30:33,116 --> 00:30:35,716
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business.</font>

386
00:30:35,886 --> 00:30:37,816
<font color="yellow">This is doctors' business.</font>

387
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,516
<font color="yellow">This is none of your business. You are a nurse.</font>

388
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:41,986
<font color="yellow">This is my area.</font>

389
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:47,146
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dr. Do.</font>

390
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:49,016
<font color="yellow">I will talk to him.</font>

391
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:52,286
<font color="yellow">We have patients here. Can we stop now?</font>

392
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:04,086
<font color="yellow">- You were wrong on this one. - Ms. Oh.</font>

393
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:06,316
<font color="yellow">I know you don't like the way he works,</font>

394
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,686
<font color="yellow">but you can't complain about it like that.</font>

395
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:10,646
<font color="yellow">You know what I mean.</font>

396
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:41,446
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

397
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:42,786
<font color="yellow">President Do.</font>

398
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:45,486
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

399
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,446
<font color="yellow">Manager Jang.</font>

400
00:31:55,786 --> 00:31:57,716
<font color="yellow">Get him out of my office.</font>

401
00:31:57,986 --> 00:31:59,016
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

402
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,146
<font color="yellow">Did I make you feel uncomfortable?</font>

403
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:04,386
<font color="yellow">Yes, you did.</font>

404
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:05,516
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

405
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:09,746
<font color="yellow">Do I remind you of some bad memories?</font>

406
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,746
<font color="yellow">Do you two know each other?</font>

407
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:15,146
<font color="yellow">I'd say yes,</font>

408
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:18,446
<font color="yellow">but we are not friends or something.</font>

409
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:23,816
<font color="yellow">I don't even know...</font>

410
00:32:24,846 --> 00:32:28,516
<font color="yellow">what President Do said to incite you.</font>

411
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:32,686
<font color="yellow">I just don't want to talk to a journalist like you.</font>

412
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:33,846
<font color="yellow">Get out of my office now.</font>

413
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:34,946
<font color="yellow">Dr. Boo Yong Joo.</font>

414
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,746
<font color="yellow">This is your problem.</font>

415
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:40,386
<font color="yellow">You treat journalists like dirt...</font>

416
00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:41,986
<font color="yellow">as if they'd do anything for money.</font>

417
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,316
<font color="yellow">It is very offensive.</font>

418
00:32:44,316 --> 00:32:46,016
<font color="yellow">You are like dirt.</font>

419
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:52,086
<font color="yellow">I'm not worse than you who killed a patient...</font>

420
00:32:52,286 --> 00:32:53,986
<font color="yellow">by having your junior doctors perform a surgery for you.</font>

421
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:56,886
<font color="yellow">At least I didn't kill a person.</font>

422
00:32:57,446 --> 00:33:00,116
<font color="yellow">There is more than one person...</font>

423
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,786
<font color="yellow">who suffered...</font>

424
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,446
<font color="yellow">and turned their back on the world because of your ridiculous reports.</font>

425
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:10,516
<font color="yellow">So I'm telling you to reveal the truth with evidence...</font>

426
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:12,846
<font color="yellow">instead of avoiding me.</font>

427
00:33:13,516 --> 00:33:14,946
<font color="yellow">If you keep shying away from it,</font>

428
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:18,146
<font color="yellow">it will just breed more misunderstandings, Dr. Boo Yong Joo.</font>

429
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:20,116
<font color="yellow">Why would I...</font>

430
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:23,046
<font color="yellow">explain myself with evidence to a jerk like you?</font>

431
00:33:23,146 --> 00:33:24,146
<font color="yellow">People want to...</font>

432
00:33:25,116 --> 00:33:26,516
<font color="yellow">know the truth.</font>

433
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:30,086
<font color="yellow">The truth?</font>

434
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,516
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

435
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:41,416
<font color="yellow">If you know the truth,</font>

436
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:45,746
<font color="yellow">do you have the courage to tell it to the world?</font>

437
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:53,646
<font color="yellow">He is...</font>

438
00:33:54,286 --> 00:33:56,916
<font color="yellow">Dr. Ahn Woo Yeol, thoracic surgeon at Geodae Hospital.</font>

439
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:00,746
<font color="yellow">It seems he was very impressed by the operation.</font>

440
00:34:01,216 --> 00:34:02,816
<font color="yellow">He praised you a lot.</font>

441
00:34:03,246 --> 00:34:06,516
<font color="yellow">It was Master Kim who did a good job.</font>

442
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:09,146
<font color="yellow">It is true that he is good,</font>

443
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:12,646
<font color="yellow">but he couldn't have done it without a good first assistant.</font>

444
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:15,816
<font color="yellow">I guess you saw I made a mistake.</font>

445
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,946
<font color="yellow">It was delayed...</font>

446
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:20,886
<font color="yellow">by more than 10 minutes because of my mistake.</font>

447
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:23,946
<font color="yellow">You are very modest.</font>

448
00:34:24,216 --> 00:34:27,446
<font color="yellow">She is a talented doctor I've supported since she was young.</font>

449
00:34:27,586 --> 00:34:29,086
<font color="yellow">She is my friend's daughter,</font>

450
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:32,186
<font color="yellow">but I feel like she's my daughter.</font>

451
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,946
<font color="yellow">I'll take this moment...</font>

452
00:34:35,586 --> 00:34:37,246
<font color="yellow">as the end of our relationship.</font>

453
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:42,386
<font color="yellow">We recently had a conflict.</font>

454
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:45,886
<font color="yellow">Are you still upset with it?</font>

455
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,616
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

456
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:53,646
<font color="yellow">I just scolded you once as a senior and a father.</font>

457
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:55,816
<font color="yellow">You can't treat me like this because of that.</font>

458
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:58,146
<font color="yellow">I've put a lot of efforts into making you a decent doctor.</font>

459
00:34:58,446 --> 00:35:00,856
<font color="yellow">Young kids are all like that these days.</font>

460
00:35:01,686 --> 00:35:04,416
<font color="yellow">It is just our generation who tried everything...</font>

461
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:07,446
<font color="yellow">to humbly beg pardon and pacify their seniors.</font>

462
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:11,986
<font color="yellow">But young people these days break off contact instead.</font>

463
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:14,716
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

464
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:17,516
<font color="yellow">I should have given it more thought.</font>

465
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:22,616
<font color="yellow">I'm pleased to meet you, anyway. Dr. Yoon.</font>

466
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:25,786
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to you about the operation...</font>

467
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:27,246
<font color="yellow">when we get a chance.</font>

468
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:31,286
<font color="yellow">Well, actually, you are single, right?</font>

469
00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:36,646
<font color="yellow">In fact, Dr. Yoon too is a single...</font>

470
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:39,116
<font color="yellow">who only thinks of her job.</font>

471
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:40,386
<font color="yellow">Just like you.</font>

472
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:44,246
<font color="yellow">I think you two would...</font>

473
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,116
<font color="yellow">make a cute couple.</font>

474
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:47,686
<font color="yellow">Don't you think, President Do?</font>

475
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,446
<font color="yellow">Spare some time to come visit me.</font>

476
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:54,316
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner together with Dr. Ahn.</font>

477
00:36:01,886 --> 00:36:02,986
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

478
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:06,386
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon, what are you doing? Master Kim is looking for you.</font>

479
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:07,646
<font color="yellow">Master Kim?</font>

480
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:09,816
<font color="yellow">You should hurry. It seems to be urgent.</font>

481
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,856
<font color="yellow">Okay. Please excuse me.</font>

482
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,146
<font color="yellow">Where is Master Kim? Is he in the office?</font>

483
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,516
<font color="yellow">He's in the staff room.</font>

484
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:32,286
<font color="yellow">In the staff room?</font>

485
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:43,586
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

486
00:36:46,216 --> 00:36:47,356
<font color="yellow">You didn't have lunch yet, right?</font>

487
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:50,446
<font color="yellow">You said Master Kim wants to see me.</font>

488
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:53,116
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat? Jajangmyeon or pizza?</font>

489
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:55,286
<font color="yellow">It is all we can order for delivery.</font>

490
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,646
<font color="yellow">Next time you are in such a situation,</font>

491
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:04,986
<font color="yellow">just leave the place without hesitation.</font>

492
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:07,856
<font color="yellow">You don't have to hear all the nonsense.</font>

493
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:12,146
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to hang up a sign on your back?</font>

494
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:15,186
<font color="yellow">"Yoon Seo Jung is taken."</font>

495
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,886
<font color="yellow">"Do not touch her." Like this.</font>

496
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:21,246
<font color="yellow">If the same thing happens again,</font>

497
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:24,986
<font color="yellow">I will go tell President Do everything.</font>

498
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:28,716
<font color="yellow">"Seo Jung has a boyfriend."</font>

499
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,616
<font color="yellow">"I'm her boyfriend."</font>

500
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:32,486
<font color="yellow">I will say that.</font>

501
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:35,086
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous.</font>

502
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:36,946
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you think I won't do that?</font>

503
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,246
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to tell him now?</font>

504
00:37:39,146 --> 00:37:40,246
<font color="yellow">I will have pizza.</font>

505
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:46,216
<font color="yellow">I want to eat pizza. I'm starving.</font>

506
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:51,816
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

507
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:52,946
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry.</font>

508
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:55,946
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about that again after eating lunch.</font>

509
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:13,186
<font color="yellow">What do you want to drink?</font>

510
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:15,186
<font color="yellow">Anything.</font>

511
00:38:16,246 --> 00:38:18,216
<font color="yellow">Do you want coke or sprite?</font>

512
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:20,856
<font color="yellow">Anything.</font>

513
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,786
<font color="yellow">That has to be the most difficult answer to work with.</font>

514
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:51,946
<font color="yellow">I can't order pizza like this.</font>

515
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:14,146
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Mr. Park.</font>

516
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,216
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

517
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:19,946
<font color="yellow">About your taking my side earlier...</font>

518
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:23,856
<font color="yellow">I do appreciate it,</font>

519
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:28,286
<font color="yellow">but I hope you don't do that in the future.</font>

520
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:31,786
<font color="yellow">I have much to learn...</font>

521
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:34,916
<font color="yellow">and I still make a lot of mistakes.</font>

522
00:39:36,586 --> 00:39:39,516
<font color="yellow">Getting corrected even in such a way...</font>

523
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:41,886
<font color="yellow">is a big help for me.</font>

524
00:39:42,116 --> 00:39:43,986
<font color="yellow">Getting corrected and getting looked down upon...</font>

525
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:45,716
<font color="yellow">are two different things.</font>

526
00:39:46,986 --> 00:39:48,146
<font color="yellow">Either way...</font>

527
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,916
<font color="yellow">I think it's something I have to cope with.</font>

528
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:54,186
<font color="yellow">- That being said... - But still, I don't think...</font>

529
00:39:55,386 --> 00:39:56,856
<font color="yellow">it's right for you to be mistreated.</font>

530
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:00,146
<font color="yellow">That's the way...</font>

531
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:02,286
<font color="yellow">I was taught here.</font>

532
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:04,946
<font color="yellow">No matter how young, I was respected.</font>

533
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,216
<font color="yellow">I was scolded when I made a big mistake,</font>

534
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,646
<font color="yellow">but I was never looked down upon as a person.</font>

535
00:40:12,986 --> 00:40:14,746
<font color="yellow">People will do it more if you just let them.</font>

536
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,856
<font color="yellow">They think it's okay.</font>

537
00:40:18,856 --> 00:40:21,686
<font color="yellow">I didn't say that to Dr. Do to take your side.</font>

538
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:26,686
<font color="yellow">If I saw any other person being treated like that at this hospital,</font>

539
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:29,516
<font color="yellow">I would have done the same.</font>

540
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:53,116
<font color="yellow">This is the emergency room.</font>

541
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:54,746
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh. It's me.</font>

542
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,686
<font color="yellow">I need to see you in the president's office. It's an emergency.</font>

543
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,446
<font color="yellow">Reporter Oh?</font>

544
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:02,986
<font color="yellow">What about him?</font>

545
00:41:03,216 --> 00:41:06,246
<font color="yellow">He's blackmailing me saying he'll expose Master Kim of his past.</font>

546
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:09,016
<font color="yellow">Starting with how he got kicked out of Geodae Hospital...</font>

547
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:11,616
<font color="yellow">and he went on about a woman named Jang Hyun Joo.</font>

548
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:18,146
<font color="yellow">Why did you take that reporter to Master Kim's office?</font>

549
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:19,446
<font color="yellow">I didn't know this would happen.</font>

550
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:22,146
<font color="yellow">All I wanted was publicity for our hospital...</font>

551
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,356
<font color="yellow">by letting the word out on the success of the operation.</font>

552
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,516
<font color="yellow">I only did it for our hospital's recognition.</font>

553
00:41:26,516 --> 00:41:28,086
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin hasn't even woken up yet.</font>

554
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,716
<font color="yellow">Why did you get ahead of yourself?</font>

555
00:41:31,716 --> 00:41:33,816
<font color="yellow">That's a bit harsh, Ms. Oh.</font>

556
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:35,446
<font color="yellow">How is that getting ahead of myself?</font>

557
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:43,116
<font color="yellow">President Yeo, why would you leave in the middle of a conversation?</font>

558
00:41:43,216 --> 00:41:44,986
<font color="yellow">I forgot that I need to go down to Sokcho.</font>

559
00:41:49,046 --> 00:41:51,516
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll have to leave early.</font>

560
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:53,116
<font color="yellow">Why would you go to Sokcho at a time like this?</font>

561
00:41:53,216 --> 00:41:55,886
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so gullible.</font>

562
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:01,586
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

563
00:42:02,046 --> 00:42:03,586
<font color="yellow">I'm not doing this for my own good.</font>

564
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,356
<font color="yellow">I'm doing everything for the hospital.</font>

565
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,046
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

566
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:20,386
<font color="yellow">That person, Jang Hyun Joo,</font>

567
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:24,486
<font color="yellow">really follows Master Kim wherever he goes.</font>

568
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:29,016
<font color="yellow">It wasn't even his own will to make others to operate on her.</font>

569
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,516
<font color="yellow">Why do you think he's not even trying to justify himself?</font>

570
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:34,516
<font color="yellow">Boo Yong Joo. That's the kind of a man he is.</font>

571
00:42:34,516 --> 00:42:37,516
<font color="yellow">He's unfriendly and stubborn as a rock.</font>

572
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:41,786
<font color="yellow">I think he feels somewhat responsible...</font>

573
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:45,116
<font color="yellow">for the death of Jang Hyun Joo.</font>

574
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:47,746
<font color="yellow">Even so, it's not something that should be buried.</font>

575
00:42:48,286 --> 00:42:50,016
<font color="yellow">What President Do and Geodae Hospital...</font>

576
00:42:50,516 --> 00:42:53,516
<font color="yellow">did to Jang Hyun Joo and some of the patients there...</font>

577
00:42:53,816 --> 00:42:56,386
<font color="yellow">and how they put all the blame on Master Kim...</font>

578
00:42:57,316 --> 00:42:59,746
<font color="yellow">Isn't it about time we put the matter in its true light?</font>

579
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:01,446
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

580
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:05,246
<font color="yellow">It's highly unlikely that they left any evidence of what they did.</font>

581
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,916
<font color="yellow">But still, I can't understand...</font>

582
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:11,246
<font color="yellow">why Master Kim is keeping quiet about it.</font>

583
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:13,746
<font color="yellow">Moreover,</font>

584
00:43:14,186 --> 00:43:16,216
<font color="yellow">it involved the death of his favorite pupil.</font>

585
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,516
<font color="yellow">Rather than mourning the deceased,</font>

586
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,786
<font color="yellow">he made an inevitable choice to save some child's life.</font>

587
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:27,646
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that's the case.</font>

588
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:30,716
<font color="yellow">Some child?</font>

589
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:33,046
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

590
00:43:34,816 --> 00:43:36,686
<font color="yellow">That's as much as I can say.</font>

591
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:40,786
<font color="yellow">I made a promise to Master Kim that I'll take it to my grave.</font>

592
00:44:03,646 --> 00:44:06,486
<font color="yellow">- Let's take a CT scan. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

593
00:44:06,716 --> 00:44:07,746
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

594
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:10,986
<font color="yellow">We'll go take a CT scan shortly. Please sit tight.</font>

595
00:44:13,246 --> 00:44:14,316
<font color="yellow">Are you busy?</font>

596
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,946
<font color="yellow">He's experiencing right flank pain.</font>

597
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:20,846
<font color="yellow">There's hematuria and he's waiting for his turn on the abdomen CT scan.</font>

598
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:22,916
<font color="yellow">It looks like an ureter stone.</font>

599
00:44:23,146 --> 00:44:25,216
<font color="yellow">I think so, too.</font>

600
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:28,816
<font color="yellow">That ulcer perforation patient in the morning...</font>

601
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:30,386
<font color="yellow">I heard you performed the operation.</font>

602
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:34,886
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. They said it could develop into a sepsis.</font>

603
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:37,616
<font color="yellow">I made the decision without your permission.</font>

604
00:44:38,146 --> 00:44:39,946
<font color="yellow">- You did good. - Okay.</font>

605
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:43,246
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

606
00:44:44,386 --> 00:44:45,886
<font color="yellow">Forget it if you didn't hear.</font>

607
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:49,786
<font color="yellow">- Please continue. - Yes, Master Kim.</font>

608
00:45:16,986 --> 00:45:19,246
<font color="yellow">You found this in Master Kim's room?</font>

609
00:45:19,686 --> 00:45:22,116
<font color="yellow">I think that's what Boo Yong Joo wanted to do...</font>

610
00:45:22,516 --> 00:45:23,916
<font color="yellow">at Doldam Hospital.</font>

611
00:45:25,216 --> 00:45:26,486
<font color="yellow">Boo Yong Joo, you swine.</font>

612
00:45:27,586 --> 00:45:29,286
<font color="yellow">Some malicious dream you've been dreaming.</font>

613
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:32,446
<font color="yellow">I can't believe he's been plotting such nonsense.</font>

614
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:34,346
<font color="yellow">It's not impossible, so to speak.</font>

615
00:45:35,016 --> 00:45:37,746
<font color="yellow">If this operation finishes successfully,</font>

616
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:40,186
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin will completely have...</font>

617
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,046
<font color="yellow">Boo Yong Joo's back.</font>

618
00:45:44,816 --> 00:45:46,186
<font color="yellow">That won't happen.</font>

619
00:45:47,616 --> 00:45:49,016

662
00:48:15,946 --> 00:48:18,486

664
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:23,816

676

<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

678
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:10,516
<font color="yellow">The fact that he hasn't woken up yet means...</font>

679
00:49:10,516 --> 00:49:13,446
<font color="yellow">that there may be a problem in his brain.</font>

680
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:15,586
<font color="yellow">You should take a CT scan immediately.</font>

682
00:49:18,046 --> 00:49:21,246

<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

684
00:49:22,886 --> 00:49:23,986
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

685
00:49:24,146 --> 00:49:26,146

<font color="yellow">with all the tubes connected to him,</font>

692
00:49:45,086 --> 00:49:46,946

693
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:49,186

694

695

<font color="yellow">that Chairman Shin would not wake up.</font>

701
