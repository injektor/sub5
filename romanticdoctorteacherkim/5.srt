<font color="yellow">It's obvious.</font>

166
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,650

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
<font color="yellow">I moved the patient with fractured pelvic bone to the X-ray room.</font>

312
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,210
<font color="yellow">- What does this look like?
- Pardon?</font>

313
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,180
<font color="yellow">His cardiac sound is dropping.</font>

314
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,750
<font color="yellow">His jugular veins are swelling, and his blood pressure is dropping.</font>

315
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,610
<font color="yellow">That's Beck's triad.</font>

316
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,050
<font color="yellow">Could it be cardiac tamponade?</font>

317
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,150
<font color="yellow">But cardiac tamponade is rarely caused by a blunt injury.</font>

318
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is rare.</font>

319
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,020
<font color="yellow">There is only one thousandth of a percent of this case.</font>

320
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,350
<font color="yellow">But does a doctor rule out such a case...</font>

321
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,810
<font color="yellow">just because it's rarely seen?</font>

322
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,210
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

323
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,410
<font color="yellow">I didn't think far enough.</font>

324
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,750
<font color="yellow">I expected you to not think that far.</font>

325
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,850
<font color="yellow">You're just an orderly.</font>

326
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,410
<font color="yellow">Get him ready for a surgery.</font>

327
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,750
<font color="yellow">And find out if someone got a hold Dr. Yang or not.</font>

328
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,780
<font color="yellow">An orderly...</font>

329
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,550
<font color="yellow">will perform only the tasks right for an orderly.</font>

330
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,350
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim.</font>

332
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,450

333
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,180
<font color="yellow">Hello? This is Kang Dong Joo.</font>

334
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,980
<font color="yellow">- Where are you?
- At Doldam Hospital. Where else?</font>

335
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,110
<font color="yellow">It's a Saturday afternoon. Are you still at work?</font>

336
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,250
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

337
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,350
<font color="yellow">This hospital is so lousy that it keeps around...</font>

338
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,520
<font color="yellow">someone who was on a night shift last night...</font>

339
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,410
<font color="yellow">until late today afternoon.</font>

340
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,520
<font color="yellow">We need to meet. When are you free?</font>

341
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I have to go into a surgery.</font>

342
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,180
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

343
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,810
<font color="yellow">Sir, did you know this, too?</font>

344
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,480
<font color="yellow">There is a very famous surgeon here at Doldam Hospital.</font>

345
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,410
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

346
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,110
<font color="yellow">meet him?</font>

347
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,380
<font color="yellow">Of course. That's why I want to thank you.</font>

348
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,710
<font color="yellow">Thank me? What do you mean?</font>

349
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,850
<font color="yellow">You led me to a great teacher.</font>

350
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,580
<font color="yellow">I'll return...</font>

351
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,480
<font color="yellow">after learning everything from him. Goodbye.</font>

352
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,580
<font color="yellow">- What about the surgery?
- We're ready.</font>

353
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,780
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

354
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
<font color="yellow">A teacher?</font>

355
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,150
<font color="yellow">Darn it!</font>

356
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,110
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Me?</font>

357
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,980
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

358
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,050
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

359
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,520
<font color="yellow">Sir, Dr. Yang just got here.</font>

360
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,250
<font color="yellow">The patient will be anesthetized in five minutes.</font>

361
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,080
<font color="yellow">This is a cardiac tamponade case.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll take his heart.</font>

363
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,080
<font color="yellow">You take care of the hemoperitoneum.</font>

364
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim.</font>

365
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,350
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

366
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,550
<font color="yellow">Don't fall asleep.</font>

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,550
<font color="yellow">What does this mean?</font>

374
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,510
<font color="yellow">They were members of Cancer Survivors Club, C.S.C.</font>

375
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,310
<font color="yellow">Does that mean all of the members here...</font>

376
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,850
<font color="yellow">have a history of cancer?</font>

377
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,110
<font color="yellow">That's correct.</font>

378
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,980
<font color="yellow">What about the one in the surgery room?</font>

379
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,410
<font color="yellow">Do you know if he has a history of cancer?</font>

380
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,650
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

381
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,080
<font color="yellow">It was his liver.</font>

382
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
<font color="yellow">Liver cancer.</font>

383
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,880

00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,280

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim.</font>

405
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,480

00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,450
<font color="yellow">You're going to make me come in there, aren't you?</font>

411
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,410
<font color="yellow">I told you to pick up the phone, Master Kim.</font>

412
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,480
<font color="yellow">You know I don't do that during operations.</font>

413
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,450
<font color="yellow">I told you it's an emergency.</font>

<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang was kicked out of Geodae Hospital...</font>

<font color="yellow">because of a liver cancer patient.</font>

418
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,510
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

419
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,550

422
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,980

423
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,350
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

424
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,810
<font color="yellow">There's bleeding in thoracic cavity, too.</font>

425
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,450
<font color="yellow">It could result in disseminated intravascular coagulation.</font>

426
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,080
<font color="yellow">Suction. Bovie.</font>

427
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,780
<font color="yellow">The patient died from excessive bleeding during an operation.</font>

428
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,110

429
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,510
<font color="yellow">You're in the middle of operation.</font>

430
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,150
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

431
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,810
<font color="yellow">- I can't stop the bleeding.
- The bleeding won't stop.</font>

432
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,750
<font color="yellow">Get it together, Dr. Kang.</font>

433
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,210
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who can save this patient.</font>

434
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang!</font>

435
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,210
<font color="yellow">Get yourself together, Kang Dong Joo.</font>

436
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,810
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

437
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,910
<font color="yellow">That patient lying down there...</font>

438
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,950
<font color="yellow">made a full recovery from liver cancer five years ago.</font>

439
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,380
<font color="yellow">I think there's been a recurrence.</font>

440
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,010
<font color="yellow">It's ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma.</font>

441
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,780
<font color="yellow">He's bleeding too much.</font>

442
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,010
<font color="yellow">And there's even bleeding from the thoracic cavity.</font>

443
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,180
<font color="yellow">I think disseminated intravascular coagulation is taking place.</font>

444
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,250
<font color="yellow">Dr. Nam. How is the bleeding?</font>

445
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,510
<font color="yellow">It can be under observation for a little longer.</font>

446
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,650
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

447
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,550
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang. Are you listening?</font>

448
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,080
<font color="yellow">You're calling the shots on that operation.</font>

449
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,480
<font color="yellow">If your decision is to give up and call it done,</font>

450
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,980
<font color="yellow">nobody's going to blame you.</font>

451
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,480
<font color="yellow">But if you do so,</font>

452
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,150
<font color="yellow">you'll look back on that moment for the rest of your life.</font>

453
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

454
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,710
<font color="yellow">I don't feel confident enough to save this patient.</font>

455
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,510
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

456
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,950
<font color="yellow">Do you know what's worse than death on the operating table?</font>

457
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,850
<font color="yellow">It's the regret you get thinking...</font>

458
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,780
<font color="yellow">you might have been able to save the patient by not giving up.</font>

459
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,280
<font color="yellow">That thought will haunt you for the rest of your life.</font>

460
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,680
<font color="yellow">If there's something worse than failure,</font>

461
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,980
<font color="yellow">it's regret.</font>

462
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,380
<font color="yellow">What do you say?</font>

463
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,980
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I really can't.</font>

464
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,610
<font color="yellow">You really can't do it?</font>

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,910
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

467
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,280
<font color="yellow">Close it up, then.</font>

468
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,650
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

469
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,950
<font color="yellow">If you don't think you can do it,</font>

470
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,480
<font color="yellow">close him up before you give him more suffering.</font>

471
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,210
<font color="yellow">Like I said, you're the one calling the shots.</font>

472
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,710
<font color="yellow">Do as you wish.</font>

473
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,310
<font color="yellow">Hang up now.</font>

474
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,910
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

475
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,450
<font color="yellow">Hello. Hello? Master Kim.</font>

476
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,910
<font color="yellow">How can you hang up like that?</font>

477
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,310
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

478
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,650
<font color="yellow">Come on. Don't be like that.</font>

479
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,050
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park. Switch with me.</font>

480
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,950
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

481
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,980
<font color="yellow">I've been through harder operations than this...</font>

482
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,480
<font color="yellow">with Master Kim.</font>

483
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,810
<font color="yellow">There were patients who died on us,</font>

484
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,480
<font color="yellow">but they tend to hang in there longer...</font>

485
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,350
<font color="yellow">as long as we don't give up until the end.</font>

486
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,210
<font color="yellow">The patient's not in the worst condition yet.</font>

487
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,650
<font color="yellow">He's still hanging in there. What should we do, Dr. Kang?</font>

488
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,010
<font color="yellow">Do we give up now?</font>

489
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,180
<font color="yellow">This is your operation.</font>

490
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,650
<font color="yellow">We will follow your order.</font>

491
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,710

493
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,610
<font color="yellow">Are you going to close him up?</font>

494
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,010
<font color="yellow">- Or...
- No.</font>

495
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,010
<font color="yellow">Let's commence the left hemihepatectomy.</font>

496
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,010
<font color="yellow">We have plenty of blood left. Don't worry about me.</font>

497
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,980
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang. Let's try everything we can do.</font>

498
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,450
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

499
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,180
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

500
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,510

504
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,950
<font color="yellow">Do you think Dr. Kang can...</font>

505
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,280
<font color="yellow">- Cut.
- Cutting.</font>

506
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,210
<font color="yellow">The heart operation is done.</font>

507
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,210
<font color="yellow">You should finish up.</font>

508
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,950
<font color="yellow">I know you're just an orderly, but you can do it, right?</font>

509
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,710
<font color="yellow">What? Yes, of course.</font>

510
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,350
<font color="yellow">Don't leave a needle in there.</font>

511
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,080
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

512
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,680
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

513
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,110
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

514
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,880
<font color="yellow">Put pressure on there.</font>

515
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,450
<font color="yellow">Nice timing.</font>

516
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,480
<font color="yellow">Are you still struggling with the bleeding?</font>

517
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,880
<font color="yellow">I was on it.</font>

518
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,580
<font color="yellow">It's not too late for me to step in if you want.</font>

519
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,710
<font color="yellow">I'm on it.</font>

520
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,450
<font color="yellow">Bovie.</font>

521
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,150
<font color="yellow">Pad.</font>

522
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,780
<font color="yellow">Irrigation.</font>

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,380
<font color="yellow">The bleeding is starting again.</font>

531
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,080
<font color="yellow">There's nothing wrong with the tied blood vessels.</font>

532
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,280
<font color="yellow">What about the hepatic vein?</font>

533
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,050
<font color="yellow">I'm going to commence resection and ligation.</font>

534
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,810
<font color="yellow">Stopping the inflow is enough to stop the bleeding. Isn't it?</font>

535
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,880
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

536
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,250
<font color="yellow">There could be a case of back flow from the veins.</font>

537
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,380
<font color="yellow">What do you do, then?</font>

538
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,610
<font color="yellow">You have to block the hepatic vein first.</font>

539
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,080
<font color="yellow">- Right.
- Hemostatic.</font>

540
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,410
<font color="yellow">Hold on to that.</font>

541
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,310
<font color="yellow">Suture.</font>

542
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,710

<font color="yellow">Pad.</font>

547
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,410
<font color="yellow">I think I can control the bleeding.</font>

548
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,550
<font color="yellow">How does it look, Dr. Nam?</font>

549
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,210
<font color="yellow">Vitals are between 50 to 90.</font>

550
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,150
<font color="yellow">Heart rate is becoming more stable.</font>

551
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,250
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

552
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,250
<font color="yellow">What are you waiting for?</font>

553
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,150
<font color="yellow">You need to do recession.</font>

554
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,580
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

555
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,610
<font color="yellow">- I'll be there soon.
- Okay.</font>

556
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

557
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,680
<font color="yellow">It was such a touching moment.</font>

558
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,810
<font color="yellow">I guess Dr. Kang did well.</font>

559
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,580
<font color="yellow">He did better than well.</font>

560
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,110
<font color="yellow">Him and Master Kim stopping the patient from bleeding was...</font>

561
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,550
<font color="yellow">like a scene from a movie.</font>

562
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,510
<font color="yellow">I knew he had to be good when I heard he was...</font>

563
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,750
<font color="yellow">the top of his class.</font>

564
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,610
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

565
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,810
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

566
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,310
<font color="yellow">Jeongseon?</font>

567
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,880
<font color="yellow">Tonight, Sir?</font>

568
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,350
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

569
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,980
<font color="yellow">Aren't you close to Dong Joo?</font>

570
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,550
<font color="yellow">We'll go and make a drink with him.</font>

571
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,710
<font color="yellow">- Make him come out.
- But Sir.</font>

572
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,880
<font color="yellow">It's finally my day off today.</font>

573
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,010
<font color="yellow">I promised my family that we'd go to an aquarium together.</font>

574
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,250
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

575
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,750
<font color="yellow">I guess I'll have to push it back.</font>

576
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,050
<font color="yellow">I'll come along. Let me call my wife.</font>

577
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,480
<font color="yellow">May I join you?</font>

578
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,580
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come?</font>

579
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,510
<font color="yellow">Are you friends with Dong Joo as well?</font>

580
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,280
<font color="yellow">- We went to school together.
- Really?</font>

581
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,080
<font color="yellow">That's great. The more, the merrier.</font>

582
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,280
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you in 30 minutes.
- Yes, Doctor.</font>

583
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,550
<font color="yellow">Hey, this is between doctors in your department.</font>

584
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,850
<font color="yellow">Stop dragging me into this.</font>

585
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,880
<font color="yellow">Don't you think he's overstepping his authority?</font>

586
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,210
<font color="yellow">I thought that Crazy Whale is also in that hospital.</font>

587
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,080
<font color="yellow">You wanted to meet her.</font>

588
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,580
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung. You're right.</font>

589
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,980
<font color="yellow">Hello, I am Lee Jun Hee, a reporter of SBN.</font>

590
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,650
<font color="yellow">Could you tell us about the accident and the patients in detail?</font>

591
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:33,580
<font color="yellow">The staff at Doldam Hospital are...</font>

592
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,050
<font color="yellow">Could you first tell us the number of the deceased and injured?</font>

593
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,710
<font color="yellow">I am getting to it.</font>

594
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,050
<font color="yellow">The staff at Doldam Hospital are...</font>

595
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,480
<font color="yellow">made up of very excellent doctors.</font>

596
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,580
<font color="yellow">Our new surgeon is a very talented young man...</font>

597
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,480
<font color="yellow">who passed his board exam with the highest score.</font>

598
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,080
<font color="yellow">He is a great addition...</font>

599
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,780
<font color="yellow">What were you going to do...</font>

600
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,280
<font color="yellow">if I had given up?</font>

601
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,380
<font color="yellow">What if I really gave up...</font>

602
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,210
<font color="yellow">- and stitched him back up?
- Nothing.</font>

603
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,680
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to do anything.</font>

604
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,650
<font color="yellow">Nothing?</font>

605
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,780
<font color="yellow">It's not my responsibility that you gave up and killed him.</font>

606
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,280
<font color="yellow">You're the one who will live your life...</font>

607
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,310
<font color="yellow">filled with guilt and regrets.</font>

608
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,580
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

609
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,680
<font color="yellow">I really don't get it.</font>

610
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,550
<font color="yellow">May I ask you why you wanted to keep me...</font>

611
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,810
<font color="yellow">in this hospital?</font>

612
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,380
<font color="yellow">- Why would I want to keep you?
- Then why did you say that?</font>

613
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,580
<font color="yellow">If you don't change,</font>

614
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,080
<font color="yellow">nothing will change. Do you understand?</font>

615
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,550
<font color="yellow">You knew I'd figure it out once I heard that.</font>

616
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,250
<font color="yellow">You knew I wouldn't leave once I figured it out, too.</font>

617
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,110
<font color="yellow">Didn't you expect that?</font>

618
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,610
<font color="yellow">Is that why...</font>

619
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,550
<font color="yellow">you've been acting like a fool?</font>

620
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,510
<font color="yellow">A fool?</font>

621
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,450
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

622
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,250
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you run a CT scan on him?</font>

623
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,450
<font color="yellow">If you had done that,</font>

624
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,920
<font color="yellow">you probably could've seen his medical history.</font>

625
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,980
<font color="yellow">I thought he may die if I didn't hurry.</font>

626
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,750
<font color="yellow">Even so, how could you not check his medical history...</font>

627
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,780
<font color="yellow">before the surgery?</font>

628
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,180
<font color="yellow">His stomach was swelling up.</font>

629
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,550
<font color="yellow">I thought he would go into a cardiac arrest if I didn't hurry.</font>

630
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,580
<font color="yellow">I did make a mistake by not checking his history.</font>

631
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,880
<font color="yellow">But it was an emergency.</font>

632
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,850
<font color="yellow">I thought stopping his bleeding was the most important thing to do.</font>

633
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,480
<font color="yellow">That's what I do.</font>

634
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,920
<font color="yellow">That's not your style.</font>

635
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,420
<font color="yellow">Hey, I thought you were all about rules.</font>

636
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,420
<font color="yellow">Rules...</font>

637
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,080
<font color="yellow">never change under any circumstances.</font>

638
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,880
<font color="yellow">Changing your words...</font>

639
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,450
<font color="yellow">according to people and circumstances is...</font>

640
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,510
<font color="yellow">not a rule, it's merely an excuse.</font>

641
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,550
<font color="yellow">I was just being flexible.</font>

642
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,850
<font color="yellow">Didn't you almost kill him...</font>

643
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,850
<font color="yellow">as you tried to follow me?</font>

644
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,350
<font color="yellow">You're making too many assumptions after a single mistake.</font>

645
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,650
<font color="yellow">Stop making excuses.</font>

646
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,880
<font color="yellow">Your single mistake almost killed someone.</font>

647
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,350
<font color="yellow">It's up to you...</font>

648
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,350
<font color="yellow">to stay or go. Do what you'd like.</font>

649
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,080
<font color="yellow">However, if you are expecting something from me,</font>

650
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,110
<font color="yellow">you should stop dreaming.</font>

651
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,380
<font color="yellow">To a guy...</font>

652
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,850
<font color="yellow">who bends his rule according to the situation,</font>

653
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,050
<font color="yellow">I have nothing else to give...</font>

654
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,480
<font color="yellow">other than neglecting, mocking, despising, and swearing at you.</font>

655
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,310
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

656
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,680
<font color="yellow">I told you about his temper.</font>

657
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,250
<font color="yellow">I told you he wasn't going to be easy.</font>

658
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,210
<font color="yellow">But you know what?</font>

659
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,550
<font color="yellow">I kind of envy you.</font>

660
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,680
<font color="yellow">You did something I've been wanting to do...</font>

661
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,680
<font color="yellow">for the last five years.</font>

662
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,510
<font color="yellow">You did a combined operation with Master Kim.</font>

663
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,920
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a combined operation. He took over.</font>

664
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,780
<font color="yellow">Also, he made sure...</font>

665
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,080
<font color="yellow">you knew about your mistakes.</font>

666
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,510
<font color="yellow">He didn't make sure. He just blamed me.</font>

667
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,050
<font color="yellow">I wish I could be blamed at.</font>

668
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
<font color="yellow">It's better to be blamed...</font>

669
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,050
<font color="yellow">than to be ignored.</font>

670
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
<font color="yellow">I am sure...</font>

671
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,350
<font color="yellow">that he has a personality disorder.</font>

672
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,250
<font color="yellow">Either that, or he's a sadist who enjoys torturing others.</font>

673
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,650
<font color="yellow">Or it might be because of his hurtful history.</font>

674
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,280
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason...</font>

675
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,080
<font color="yellow">when such a great doctor casts away his name...</font>

676
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,350
<font color="yellow">and stays here in hiding. Don't you think so?</font>

842
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,680

843
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,110

<font color="yellow">I'm an ER doctor and a cardiac surgeon.</font>

845

- Okay, then.</font>

877
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I can't use this one.</font>

878
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,480

<font color="yellow">Who are you, by the way?</font>

911
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,380
<font color="yellow">I don't suppose you have come a long way just to see Crazy Whale.</font>

912
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,280
<font color="yellow">What brought you here?</font>

913
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,250
<font color="yellow">Hey, In Beom.</font>

914
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,750
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

915
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:32,950
<font color="yellow">I just got lost looking around the hospital.</font>

916
