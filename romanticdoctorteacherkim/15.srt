<font color="yellow">Did you put the necklace on her yourself?</font>

157
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,440
<font color="yellow">- Do I have to? - Dear me.</font>

158
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,610
<font color="yellow">That's basic.</font>

159
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,140
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

160
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,510
<font color="yellow">Why do you think men spend all that money...</font>

161
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,280
<font color="yellow">to buy presents for women?</font>

162
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,040
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason behind the actions of men.</font>

163
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,610
<font color="yellow">A ring is to hold a woman's hand.</font>

164
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,970
<font color="yellow">A necklace?</font>

165
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,740
<font color="yellow">It is for a hug.</font>

166
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,670
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

167
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,070
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

168
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,310
<font color="yellow">So did Seo Jung put on the necklace?</font>

169
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,410
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think so.</font>

170
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

171
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,970
<font color="yellow">If she didn't wear the necklace on purpose,</font>

172
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,940
<font color="yellow">it means something.</font>

173
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,740
<font color="yellow">Maybe, she didn't like the necklace...</font>

174
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,340
<font color="yellow">or the person who gave it to her.</font>

175
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,870
<font color="yellow">That doesn't sound right.</font>

176
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,370
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't let your guard down.</font>

177
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,440
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

178
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,070
<font color="yellow">Could you go check out the patient in the third bed?</font>

179
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,610
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

180
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,440
<font color="yellow">What do you think you are doing now?</font>

181
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,510
<font color="yellow">You don't need to bother.</font>

182
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,610
<font color="yellow">I was just a little jealous, so I messed around with him.</font>

183
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,940
<font color="yellow">Were you jealous?</font>

184
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,010
<font color="yellow">- Why? - My romance ended in failure...</font>

185
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,440
<font color="yellow">unlike his.</font>

186
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,040
<font color="yellow">I should go, then.</font>

187
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,870
<font color="yellow">Hello? What's up?</font>

188
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,670
<font color="yellow">Are you wearing the necklace I gave you?</font>

189
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,140
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me that?</font>

190
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,040
<font color="yellow">Aren't you?</font>

191
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,810
<font color="yellow">I'm busy now. I'm on my rounds.</font>

192
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,770
<font color="yellow">Just tell me...</font>

193
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,510
<font color="yellow">you are wearing it or not.</font>

194
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,440
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Dr. Kang.</font>

195
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,040
<font color="yellow">We are working now.</font>

196
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,870
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't mix business with pleasure.</font>

197
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,570
<font color="yellow">- I'm hanging up. - Seo Jung.</font>

198
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,870
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

199
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,940
<font color="yellow">Isn't she wearing the necklace?</font>

200
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,510
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Chairman...</font>

201
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,610
<font color="yellow">Shin.</font>

202
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,110
<font color="yellow">- His daughter? - Yes.</font>

203
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,040
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin's daughter has just arrived.</font>

204
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,640
<font color="yellow">Maybe you know her, too.</font>

205
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,570
<font color="yellow">She used to...</font>

206
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,140
<font color="yellow">work at Geodae Hospital as the head of strategic management.</font>

207
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,010
<font color="yellow">Stop being so bullheaded and leave the hospital.</font>

208
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,570
<font color="yellow">You are being absurd.</font>

209
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,710
<font color="yellow">I'm hospitalized here.</font>

210
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,070
<font color="yellow">Why would I leave?</font>

211
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,310
<font color="yellow">You should stay in more decent hospital.</font>

212
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,310
<font color="yellow">A hospital with better doctors.</font>

213
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,640
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here?</font>

214
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,410
<font color="yellow">Just go back to Florida and take care of your children.</font>

215
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,770
<font color="yellow">You are bothering me.</font>

216
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,840
<font color="yellow">Who asked you to come here?</font>

217
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,740
<font color="yellow">Is that President Do?</font>

218
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,340
<font color="yellow">It is an artificial heart operation we are talking about.</font>

219
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,470
<font color="yellow">How would I even let you have such an important operation...</font>

220
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,170
<font color="yellow">in this lame hospital?</font>

221
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,740
<font color="yellow">Also, you are the chairman of the foundation of Geodae Hospital.</font>

222
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,910
<font color="yellow">What if the chairman has an operation...</font>

223
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,670
<font color="yellow">in such a small hospital and it goes wrong?</font>

224
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,910
<font color="yellow">Geodae Hospital will lose face.</font>

225
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,310
<font color="yellow">People will soon think you have poor judgement.</font>

226
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,870
<font color="yellow">Some will even say you are in your dotage.</font>

227
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

228
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,270
<font color="yellow">Dotage?</font>

229
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,410
<font color="yellow">If you don't want any of it, you should come to Seoul with me.</font>

230
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,370
<font color="yellow">I will take care of the discharge procedures.</font>

231
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

232
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,340
<font color="yellow">He can't leave the hospital without his doctor's permission.</font>

233
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,040
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

234
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
<font color="yellow">A patient is not supposed to leave the hospital...</font>

235
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,970
<font color="yellow">without a doctor's permission.</font>

236
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,710
<font color="yellow">I'm the director of this hospital.</font>

237
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,910
<font color="yellow">I mean I'm the one...</font>

238
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,170
<font color="yellow">of high rank.</font>

239
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,870
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

240
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
<font color="yellow">Dr. Boo Yong Joo.</font>

241
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,240
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

242
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,540
<font color="yellow">What would a doctor do in a hospital?</font>

243
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,670
<font color="yellow">I'm taking care of the patients.</font>

244
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,010
<font color="yellow">You are already kicked out from the medical world.</font>

245
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,910
<font color="yellow">How dare you pretend to be a doctor in the doctor's gown?</font>

246
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,240
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything wrong to be disqualified.</font>

247
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,810
<font color="yellow">And you guys set me up...</font>

248
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,540
<font color="yellow">to be kicked out.</font>

249
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,440
<font color="yellow">So did you cajole Chairman Shin...</font>

250
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,640
<font color="yellow">for your comeback?</font>

251
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,270
<font color="yellow">I thought he was just an old man with a lot of money.</font>

252
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,370
<font color="yellow">I had no idea that he was the chairman of the foundation.</font>

253
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,470
<font color="yellow">Or that he was your father.</font>

254
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,610
<font color="yellow">It's been a lot of surprises for me.</font>

255
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,410
<font color="yellow">I will move him to Geodae Hospital immediately.</font>

256
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,210
<font color="yellow">Is it what Chairman Shin asked?</font>

257
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,340
<font color="yellow">It is my decision. I'm his guardian.</font>

258
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,140
<font color="yellow">I can't leave my father to a doctor like you even for a moment.</font>

259
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,640
<font color="yellow">A doctor like me?</font>

260
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,740
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

261
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,010
<font color="yellow">- What? - You'd better define the word.</font>

262
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,270
<font color="yellow">You are being vague,</font>

263
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,940
<font color="yellow">so I'm not getting your point.</font>

264
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,140
<font color="yellow">Let's be clear about this.</font>

265
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,810
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by "a doctor like me"?</font>

266
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,640
<font color="yellow">Look, Dr. Boo Yong Joo.</font>

267
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,240
<font color="yellow">Everyone calls me Master Kim here.</font>

268
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,410
<font color="yellow">Master Kim?</font>

269
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,140
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can hide your past with a new name?</font>

270
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,710
<font color="yellow">I'm not hiding anything.</font>

271
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,140
<font color="yellow">Let's just say it is for self-examination.</font>

272
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,170
<font color="yellow">I once...</font>

273
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,270
<font color="yellow">pursued a better life...</font>

274
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,740
<font color="yellow">by taking a wrong way...</font>

275
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,270
<font color="yellow">with seductive words of yours.</font>

276
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,740
<font color="yellow">It is to show that I introspect about my mistake.</font>

277
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,710
<font color="yellow">- Chairman Shin's daughter? - Yes.</font>

278
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,540
<font color="yellow">She says...</font>

279
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,170
<font color="yellow">she is the one...</font>

280
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,010
<font color="yellow">of higher rank than us.</font>

281
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,570
<font color="yellow">And she seems to have some ill-fated relationship with Master Kim.</font>

282
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,240
<font color="yellow">Do you know anything about that?</font>

283
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,710
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

284
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,310
<font color="yellow">I met Master Kim after he left Geodae Hospital.</font>

285
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,340
<font color="yellow">But you have worked with Master Kim for so long.</font>

286
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,270
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear anything about that?</font>

287
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,370
<font color="yellow">No. Never.</font>

288
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,840
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

289
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,240
<font color="yellow">Are you dating Dr. Kang?</font>

290
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,970
<font color="yellow">Who told you that?</font>

291
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,870
<font color="yellow">Did Dr. Kang say that?</font>

292
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,770
<font color="yellow">No, it's just Manager Jang's guess.</font>

293
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,040
<font color="yellow">He says there is something going on between you two.</font>

294
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,840
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

295
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,910
<font color="yellow">No, it's not.</font>

296
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,640
<font color="yellow">It's not true.</font>

297
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,510
<font color="yellow">- I'm serious. - I see.</font>

298
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,410
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you.</font>

299
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,810
<font color="yellow">Trust me. You have to trust me.</font>

300
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,210
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

301
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,610
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

302
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,270
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Woo. - Yes?</font>

303
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,440
<font color="yellow">Where is Dong Joo?</font>

304
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,210
<font color="yellow">He's in the hybrid room.</font>

305
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,770
<font color="yellow">- What do you think? - I think...</font>

306
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,810
<font color="yellow">it is pancrease tail.</font>

307
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,070
<font color="yellow">I see. I thought so, too.</font>

308
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,770
<font color="yellow">I don't think it is pancrease tail.</font>

309
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,980
<font color="yellow">You don't?</font>

310
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,810
<font color="yellow">It is abscess for sure,</font>

311
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,010
<font color="yellow">but I think it is originated in bowel.</font>

312
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,240
<font color="yellow">Bowel?</font>

313
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,140
<font color="yellow">Is that what you think?</font>

314
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,710
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to page Master Kim?</font>

315
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,540
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

316
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,270
<font color="yellow">Why would you call Master Kim? I'm right here.</font>

317
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,440
<font color="yellow">The scan is unclear,</font>

318
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,810
<font color="yellow">so I just wanted another's opinion.</font>

319
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,670
<font color="yellow">You've been so disrespectful...</font>

320
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,110
<font color="yellow">and disobedient to me.</font>

321
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,270
<font color="yellow">Do you think you are really great as Master Kim favors you?</font>

322
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,310
<font color="yellow">I don't think Master Kim favors me.</font>

323
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,440
<font color="yellow">Look closely at the scan with your eyes.</font>

324
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,710
<font color="yellow">It is obviously originated in bowel.</font>

325
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,310
<font color="yellow">- But it is connected to... - Hey.</font>

326
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,810
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to teach me or something?</font>

327
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,440
<font color="yellow">I'm just giving my opinion.</font>

328
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,370
<font color="yellow">It may look like that but...</font>

329
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,140
<font color="yellow">So it is originated in bowel.</font>

330
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,440
<font color="yellow">It can't be pancrease tail.</font>

331
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,770
<font color="yellow">Don't you think, Dr. Do?</font>

332
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,110
<font color="yellow">That's what I think.</font>

333
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,870
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Song. - The patient's BP is dropping.</font>

334
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,040
<font color="yellow">It is 80 over 40.</font>

335
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,410
<font color="yellow">Set up central lines and execute a full drop.</font>

336
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,610
<font color="yellow">Also, inject 10cc of norepinephrine.</font>

337
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,110
<font color="yellow">And bring me a Foley catheter.</font>

338
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,340
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

339
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,910
<font color="yellow">Stay back.</font>

340
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,610
<font color="yellow">Set up central lines and execute a full drop of 500cc.</font>

341
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

342
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,070
<font color="yellow">Inject 10cc of norepinephrine, too.</font>

343
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,610
<font color="yellow">And bring me a Foley catheter.</font>

344
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,870
<font color="yellow">Dr. Do will operate on this patient.</font>

345
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,910
<font color="yellow">He is my patient, Dr. Song.</font>

346
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,370
<font color="yellow">You can't even read the CT scan right.</font>

347
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,610
<font color="yellow">Set up central lines and move him to the operating room.</font>

348
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,870
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

349
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,110
<font color="yellow">Let me inject antibiotic while you set up central lines.</font>

350
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,570
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

351
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,710
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang looks pretty upset.</font>

352
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,010
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

353
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,670
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Woo. - Yes.</font>

354
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,370
<font color="yellow">Have you assisted an operation before?</font>

355
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,510
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I have. - Okay.</font>

356
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,410
<font color="yellow">You will be assisting me today.</font>

357
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,440
<font color="yellow">I will see you in the operating room in 10 minutes.</font>

358
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,480
<font color="yellow">No matter how I look at it, it's near the pancreas.</font>

359
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,670
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung, can you knock?</font>

360
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,610
<font color="yellow">What was that about with Dr. Song?</font>

361
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,040
<font color="yellow">Why did you get into an argument?</font>

362
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,010
<font color="yellow">We just had some disagreements.</font>

363
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,040
<font color="yellow">By the way, Dong Joo,</font>

364
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,210
<font color="yellow">did you say something weird to Manager Jang?</font>

365
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,410
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

366
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,510
<font color="yellow">Did you tell him that we're dating or something like that?</font>

367
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,710
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

368
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,480
<font color="yellow">I've never put it bluntly like that.</font>

369
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,840
<font color="yellow">Then why did Ms. Oh ask me that?</font>

370
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,670
<font color="yellow">What did she ask you?</font>

371
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,510
<font color="yellow">She asked me if we're dating.</font>

372
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,040
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you didn't lead her on?</font>

373
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,440
<font color="yellow">No way. I'm very careful when it comes to things like that.</font>

374
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,810
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you wearing the necklace?</font>

375
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,610
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep asking me that?</font>

376
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,110
<font color="yellow">I just want to know...</font>

377
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,910
<font color="yellow">if we're dating now as of yesterday.</font>

378
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,140
<font color="yellow">This is exactly why I can't start anything with you.</font>

379
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,770
<font color="yellow">We didn't start anything?</font>

380
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,480
<font color="yellow">What was yesterday, then?</font>

381
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
<font color="yellow">Yesterday?</font>

382
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,270
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

383
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,410
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

384
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,570
<font color="yellow">I guess it can't be helped. I'll have to do it again.</font>

385
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,170
<font color="yellow">- See? - What? What did I do?</font>

386
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,110
<font color="yellow">How can I start things with you when you're so blatantly obvious?</font>

387
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,510
<font color="yellow">I'm obvious?</font>

388
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,980
<font color="yellow">I doubt it. I have an amazing poker face.</font>

389
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,670
<font color="yellow">I'm Poker Face Kang. Haven't you heard of it?</font>

390
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,510
<font color="yellow">Poker face, my foot. You make it look so obvious.</font>

391
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,140
<font color="yellow">Tell everyone here at Doldam Hospital, why don't you?</font>

392
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,270
<font color="yellow">Can I do that?</font>

393
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

394
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,370
<font color="yellow">Promise me one thing.</font>

395
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,710
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

396
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,440
<font color="yellow">Promise me you'll only be professional at the hospital.</font>

397
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,270
<font color="yellow">I will continue to be your senior doctor...</font>

398
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,240
<font color="yellow">and you will continue to be Dr. Kang.</font>

399
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,270
<font color="yellow">Like how we've been until now,</font>

400
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,010
<font color="yellow">we can't bring our emotions to the workplace.</font>

401
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,640
<font color="yellow">We'll be simple coworkers.</font>

402
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,540
<font color="yellow">Let's do that, okay?</font>

403
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,670
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

404
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,870
<font color="yellow">I'll promise you...</font>

405
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,410
<font color="yellow">if you say we'll be dating as of today.</font>

406
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,970
<font color="yellow">- I'll have to see about that. - You'll have to see about that?</font>

407
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,870
<font color="yellow">When is it going to be?</font>

408
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,740
<font color="yellow">I'll have to see about that. Get back to work.</font>

409
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,910
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

410
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

411
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,210
<font color="yellow">I knew it. You need to work on your poker face.</font>

412
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,840
<font color="yellow">At this rate, everyone here at this hospital will become aware.</font>

413
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,340
<font color="yellow">Stop that.</font>

414
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,510
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

415
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,870
<font color="yellow">- Oh, "I love you"? - Gosh.</font>

416
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,110
<font color="yellow">You want me to stop saying I love you?</font>

417
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,770
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. - Okay.</font>

418
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,470
<font color="yellow">- I love... - Stop it.</font>

419
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,970
<font color="yellow">Fine. From now on, I'll never say that I love you.</font>

420
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,740
<font color="yellow">I love...</font>

421
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,410
<font color="yellow">I love you. I love you.</font>

422
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,210
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Stop.</font>

423
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,170
<font color="yellow">I love you. I love you.</font>

424
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,510
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

425
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,370
<font color="yellow">- I love you. - No.</font>

426
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,910
<font color="yellow">What is it that you're after?</font>

427
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,910
<font color="yellow">Going back to Geodae Hospital?</font>

428
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,040
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any questions regarding Chairman Shin?</font>

429
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but President Do will run things around there for a while.</font>

430
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,440
<font color="yellow">It's most likely that the board will reappoint him.</font>

431
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:08,110
<font color="yellow">There's nothing for you to gain even if you do go back there.</font>

432
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,770
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin...</font>

433
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,540
<font color="yellow">is in a worse condition than we expected.</font>

434
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,270
<font color="yellow">You must be trying to make a dramatic turn-around...</font>

435
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,540
<font color="yellow">by performing a successful operation on Chairman Shin, but...</font>

436
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,870
<font color="yellow">You can read CT scans, right?</font>

437
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,740
<font color="yellow">From what I know, you too are a graduate of a medical school.</font>

438
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,110
<font color="yellow">Whose is that?</font>

439
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,940
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin.</font>

440
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,140
<font color="yellow">As you can see,</font>

441
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,870
<font color="yellow">he has late-stage lung cancer.</font>

442
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,970
<font color="yellow">Lung cancer?</font>

443
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,310
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

444
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,410
<font color="yellow">That's what the CT scans say, at least.</font>

445
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,840
<font color="yellow">What about treatment?</font>

446
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,470
<font color="yellow">Can it not be treated?</font>

447
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,940
<font color="yellow">There are many different kinds of lung cancer, Chairman Shin.</font>

448
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,510
<font color="yellow">First, we'll have to do a biopsy...</font>

449
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,040
<font color="yellow">to find out what kind of cancer it is.</font>

450
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,440
<font color="yellow">Then, we can try to figure out how to treat it.</font>

451
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,740
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

452
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,040
<font color="yellow">What if it doesn't get treated?</font>

453
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,370
<font color="yellow">How much time do I have?</font>

454
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,040
<font color="yellow">Three months...</font>

455
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,640
<font color="yellow">at maximum, Chairman Shin.</font>

456
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,240
<font color="yellow">Regardless of my heart?</font>

457
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,440
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

458
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

459
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,310
<font color="yellow">what do you intend to do?</font>

460
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,870
<font color="yellow">There isn't much a doctor can do at this point.</font>

461
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,710
<font color="yellow">There aren't many proposals to make, either.</font>

462
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,840
<font color="yellow">(Doctor's Office)</font>

463
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,610

619
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,110
<font color="yellow">If we just suture this area,</font>

620
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,610
<font color="yellow">we can save the spleen.</font>

621
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,070
<font color="yellow">May I do it?</font>

622
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,670
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

623
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,310
<font color="yellow">This is my operation. Why are you taking it away from me?</font>

624
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,310
<font color="yellow">If you're feeling confident, you can do it.</font>

625
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,540
<font color="yellow">You said you have done it before.</font>

626
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,380
<font color="yellow">If this goes wrong,</font>

627
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,940
<font color="yellow">this is all on you, Dr. Kang.</font>

628
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,380
<font color="yellow">Are you still going to do it?</font>

629
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,340
<font color="yellow">You really are consistent.</font>

630
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,410
<font color="yellow">The first thing you do is looking for someone to blame.</font>

631
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,970
<font color="yellow">Stop your nonsense.</font>

632
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,380
<font color="yellow">Are you going to do it or not?</font>

633
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,170
<font color="yellow">Loupe.</font>

634
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,910
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

635
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,770
<font color="yellow">Number five.</font>

636
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,440
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

637
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,440
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

638
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,140
<font color="yellow">Focus.</font>

639
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,380
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

640
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,410
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

641
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,070
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

642
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,170
<font color="yellow">Releasing.</font>

643
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,840
<font color="yellow">Irrigation.</font>

644
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,310
<font color="yellow">There's no bleeding.</font>

645
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,540
<font color="yellow">I think the spleen will be fine now.</font>

646
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,970
<font color="yellow">Should I close him up?</font>

647
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,510
<font color="yellow">Do In Beom.</font>

648
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,810
<font color="yellow">How much longer are you going to lie at an operation table?</font>

649
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,010
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

650
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,340
<font color="yellow">Take today for example.</font>

651
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,810
<font color="yellow">You've never done distal pancreatectomy before.</font>

652
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,810
<font color="yellow">Isn't right that we switch positions, then?</font>

653
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,070
<font color="yellow">It was my operation.</font>

654
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,140
<font color="yellow">I thought I could handle the operation.</font>

655
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,170
<font color="yellow">I've done simulations by watching videos of it on the Internet.</font>

656
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,170
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

657
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,210
<font color="yellow">How can watching a video and the actual operation be the same?</font>

658
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,880
<font color="yellow">That's how I always practice.</font>

659
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,570
<font color="yellow">How else am I going to experience all the different cases?</font>

660
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,240
<font color="yellow">You irresponsible scum.</font>

661
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,970
<font color="yellow">Without such practice,</font>

662
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,040
<font color="yellow">becoming a surgeon is impossible.</font>

663
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,440
<font color="yellow">Once you cut a patient's abdomen open,</font>

664
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,010
<font color="yellow">no one knows what will happen.</font>

665
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,010
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

666
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,540
<font color="yellow">you will keep lying to get more experiences?</font>

667
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,510
<font color="yellow">You were just lucky with the spleen. Don't get smart with me.</font>

668
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,240
<font color="yellow">I hope you will stop lying about your experiences.</font>

669
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,380
<font color="yellow">If you do that again,</font>

670
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,510
<font color="yellow">I will send the issue to the committee.</font>

671
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,210
<font color="yellow">You coward.</font>

672
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,740
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

673
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,410
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

674
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,040
<font color="yellow">Get off me.</font>

675
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,710
<font color="yellow">- Get off. - Hey.</font>

676
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,540
<font color="yellow">Get off me.</font>

677
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,340
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

678
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,880
<font color="yellow">Why don't you bring your father?</font>

679
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,610
<font color="yellow">- You idiot. - Mr. Goo.</font>

680
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,310
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

681
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,540
<font color="yellow">Get off me.</font>

682
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,270
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

683
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,210
<font color="yellow">Please stop that.</font>

684
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

685
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,310
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

686
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

687
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,540
<font color="yellow">What? Did they have a fight again?</font>

688
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,070
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang was so cool in the operating room.</font>

689
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,070
<font color="yellow">It made Dr. Do a little frustrated.</font>

690
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,240
<font color="yellow">Was Dong Joo cool?</font>

691
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,240
<font color="yellow">- What happened? - He was doing angiorrhaphy.</font>

692
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,340
<font color="yellow">It was like Master Kim was there.</font>

693
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,880
<font color="yellow">He was just like Master Kim.</font>

694
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,510
<font color="yellow">Stay focused.</font>

695
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,610
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

696
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,740
<font color="yellow">Did Dong Joo imitate Master Kim?</font>

697
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,240
<font color="yellow">He was not just imitating. He was as good as Master Kim.</font>

698
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,510
<font color="yellow">His skills were not as good as Master Kim's,</font>

699
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,110
<font color="yellow">- but they were pretty close. - What was that?</font>

700
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,380
<font color="yellow">He always backbites Master Kim for being so arrogant.</font>

701
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,470
<font color="yellow">Maybe he learned something while backbiting Master Kim.</font>

702
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,240
<font color="yellow">People get closer after a fight.</font>

703
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,570
<font color="yellow">So where are they now?</font>

704
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,770
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

705
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,840
<font color="yellow">What did you two fight about?</font>

706
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,770
<font color="yellow">Say it.</font>

707
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,770
<font color="yellow">He intercepted my surgery,</font>

708
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,970
<font color="yellow">so I got upset.</font>

709
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
<font color="yellow">I will make sure this never happens again.</font>

710
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,170
<font color="yellow">What about you, Dong Joo? Do you have anything to tell me?</font>

711
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,770
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

712
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,840
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

713
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,040
<font color="yellow">If you don't, get out of my office.</font>

714
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,810
<font color="yellow">I heard you two had a fight again.</font>

715
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,170
<font color="yellow">I heard you knocked against each other.</font>

716
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,210
<font color="yellow">He hit me first. What was I supposed to do?</font>

717
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,880
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you two?</font>

718
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,770
<font color="yellow">You are of the same age. You can be good friends.</font>

719
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,210
<font color="yellow">You two are very difficult people,</font>

720
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,610
<font color="yellow">so you don't have many friends.</font>

721
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,340
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I have many friends.</font>

722
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,410
<font color="yellow">Is that so? Maybe that's why no one has come to Jeongseon...</font>

723
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,110
<font color="yellow">to see you since you came here.</font>

724
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,810
<font color="yellow">That's just because they are busy with their work.</font>

725
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,340
<font color="yellow">What about you? You don't have many friends.</font>

726
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,340
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

727
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,970
<font color="yellow">Ms. Eom, Dr. Jung, Mr. Park...</font>

728
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,810
<font color="yellow">And I often drink beer and talk with Ms. Oh...</font>

729
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,240
<font color="yellow">and Dr. Nam.</font>

730
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,070
<font color="yellow">They are my friends.</font>

731
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,240
<font color="yellow">- I see. They are your friends. - Right.</font>

732
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,940
<font color="yellow">Then the trees and birds in the backyard of the hospital...</font>

733
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,740
<font color="yellow">are your friends, too.</font>

734
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,570
<font color="yellow">I should get going.</font>

735
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,440
<font color="yellow">You can't just leave like that.</font>

736
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,710
<font color="yellow">Weren't you worried about me?</font>

737
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,770
<font color="yellow">Make sure to put some medicine on the wound.</font>

738
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,470
<font color="yellow">I should go.</font>

739
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,010
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

740
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,770
<font color="yellow">I told you not to do that.</font>

741
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,640
<font color="yellow">This is so embarrassing.</font>

742
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,310
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

743
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,740
<font color="yellow">I want you to leave now.</font>

744
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,770
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

745
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,040
<font color="yellow">You are grown-up. No more fighting.</font>

746
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,140
<font color="yellow">I told you Dr. Do hit me first.</font>

747
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,740
<font color="yellow">Maybe you made him upset.</font>

748
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,040
<font color="yellow">I know what he's like.</font>

749
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,540
<font color="yellow">He's not the kind of person who'd hit someone for no reason.</font>

750
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:21,310
<font color="yellow">He grew up without knowing a day of hardship.</font>

751
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,510
<font color="yellow">- Are you siding with him or what? - That's it.</font>

752
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,970
<font color="yellow">Be more cautious in the future.</font>

753
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,010
<font color="yellow">This is a hospital, not a boxing ring.</font>

754
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,070
<font color="yellow">They are not that good at acting.</font>

755
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,110
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

756
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,870
<font color="yellow">Why are you so upset?</font>

757
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:53,970
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

758
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,570
<font color="yellow">I'm not upset.</font>

759
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,270
<font color="yellow">I was never close to Dong Joo.</font>

760
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,240
<font color="yellow">And he intercepted my surgery,</font>

761
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,440
<font color="yellow">so I lost my temper.</font>

762
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,010
<font color="yellow">You are not telling me the truth.</font>

763
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,510
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

764
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,770
<font color="yellow">is it that...</font>

765
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,340
<font color="yellow">you don't know how to tell the truth?</font>

766
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,240
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - That's it. Get out.</font>

767
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,970
<font color="yellow">About Chairman Shin's operation.</font>

768
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,570
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid...</font>

769
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,710
<font color="yellow">we won't be doing the operation.</font>

770
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,170
<font color="yellow">He has lung cancer terminal.</font>

771
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,170
<font color="yellow">Go and tell your father about it.</font>

772
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,570
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

773
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,010
<font color="yellow">That's what you are here for.</font>

774
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,070
<font color="yellow">And that's why you wanted to join my operation team.</font>

775
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,670
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>

776
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,940
<font color="yellow">I prefer a cornered stone...</font>

777
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,310
<font color="yellow">than a round one.</font>

778
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,540
<font color="yellow">If you are a cornered stone,</font>

779
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,940
<font color="yellow">it means you have your own style...</font>

780
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,540
<font color="yellow">and your own thoughts.</font>

781
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,240
<font color="yellow">I like to see a cornered stone being faced...</font>

782
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,740
<font color="yellow">with the mason's chisel.</font>

783
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,570
<font color="yellow">I don't like anything roundish and lukewarm.</font>

784
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,310
<font color="yellow">Rubbing the corners off me,</font>

785
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,270
<font color="yellow">I'd like to make myself better...</font>

786
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,610
<font color="yellow">with my philosophy and belief.</font>

787
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,210
<font color="yellow">I may thought that...</font>

788
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,870
<font color="yellow">you were one of those people.</font>

789
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,040
<font color="yellow">You did something...</font>

790
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,110
<font color="yellow">you didn't have to do that day.</font>

791
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,870
<font color="yellow">I don't think it was just your sheer bravado on your father's coat-tails.</font>

792
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,740
<font color="yellow">I thought you did it only for the dangerous patient.</font>

793
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,610
<font color="yellow">And you were not that bad.</font>

794
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,010
<font color="yellow">So I tried to get you on my side.</font>

795
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,140
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

796
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,040
<font color="yellow">Maybe...</font>

797
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,610
<font color="yellow">I was wrong about that.</font>

798
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,970
<font color="yellow">Go tell your father about that.</font>

799
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,340
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin won't have an operation in our hospital.</font>

800
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,170
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

801
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,970
<font color="yellow">he doesn't need to be anxious about it anymore.</font>

802
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,570
<font color="yellow">And I guess...</font>

803
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,110
<font color="yellow">you should leave Doldam Hospital.</font>

804
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,070
<font color="yellow">Lung cancer terminal?</font>

805
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,910
<font color="yellow">Late-stage lung cancer?</font>

806
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,370
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's what I heard.</font>

807
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,570
<font color="yellow">What about the operation?</font>

808
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,240
<font color="yellow">What will they do with the artificial heart operation?</font>

809
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,110
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin won't make it until then.</font>

810
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,310
<font color="yellow">Did Boo Yong Joo say that?</font>

811
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:25,810
<font color="yellow">Are you sure he said...</font>

812
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,640
<font color="yellow">he'd give up on the operation?</font>

813
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,870
<font color="yellow">Yes, he said that to me.</font>

814
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:32,710
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

815
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,110
<font color="yellow">I get it.</font>

816
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,240
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

817
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,540
<font color="yellow">What? Tell me.</font>

818
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,110
<font color="yellow">Can I...</font>

819
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,240
<font color="yellow">go back to Geodae Hospital?</font>

820
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,710
<font color="yellow">Wait a little longer...</font>

821
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,610
<font color="yellow">until things are settled.</font>

822
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,540
<font color="yellow">Stop whining.</font>

823
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,240
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

824
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,270
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

825
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,540
<font color="yellow">I came here as soon as I heard about Chairman Shin.</font>

826
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,040
<font color="yellow">You must be devastated.</font>

827
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,410
<font color="yellow">Who told you about him?</font>

828
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,510
<font color="yellow">At Doldam Hospital,</font>

829
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,140
<font color="yellow">there are a few people who are my eyes and ears.</font>

830
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,440
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

831
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,540
<font color="yellow">It's hard to say this to you,</font>

832
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,210
<font color="yellow">but since it turned out this way,</font>

833
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,570
<font color="yellow">I think Chairman Shin has to give up on the heart surgery.</font>

834
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,470
<font color="yellow">What is your opinion?</font>

835
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,570
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

836
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,440
<font color="yellow">I should go through the surgery?</font>

837
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:01,140
<font color="yellow">Or do you think I am going to die soon anyway...</font>

838
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,070
<font color="yellow">and I should not...</font>

839
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,910
<font color="yellow">get the dangerous surgery?</font>

840
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,470
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

841
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,540
<font color="yellow">in a situation like this,</font>

842
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,310
<font color="yellow">following the patient's decision is...</font>

843
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,910
<font color="yellow">the only thing a doctor can do, Chairman Shin.</font>

844
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,470
<font color="yellow">If I decide...</font>

845
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,540
<font color="yellow">not to get the surgery,</font>

846
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,270
<font color="yellow">what would happen?</font>

847
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,470
<font color="yellow">I meant to fix your heart,</font>

848
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:42,570
<font color="yellow">and keep asking you for money saying that I saved you.</font>

849
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,340
<font color="yellow">Anyway, my plan would fail.</font>

850
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,810
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

851
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,770
<font color="yellow">How can you still make jokes like that in such a situation?</font>

852
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,870
<font color="yellow">We cannot assure you or predict...</font>

853
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,670
<font color="yellow">whether your heart or your lung...</font>

854
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:04,870
<font color="yellow">will stop functioning first, Chairman Shin.</font>

855
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,570
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

856
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,640
<font color="yellow">I decide to get the surgery anyway?</font>

857
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:19,310
<font color="yellow">The artificial heart replacement surgery...</font>

858
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,070
<font color="yellow">also have a high risk.</font>

859
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:28,610
<font color="yellow">Neither of them would be a good choice.</font>

860
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,970
<font color="yellow">Right. I see.</font>

861
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,270
<font color="yellow">- Hello, President Yeo. - Hi.</font>

862
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,540
<font color="yellow">Manager Jang, you were here, too.</font>

863
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,810
<font color="yellow">Would you like to have a cup of coffee, too?</font>

864
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,670
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

865
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,670
<font color="yellow">About Dr. Kang...</font>

866
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,970
<font color="yellow">He may appear to be picky, but once you get to know him,</font>

867
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,570
<font color="yellow">you can see that he has such a good heart.</font>

868
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,670
<font color="yellow">- Don't you think so, President Yeo? - Well, yes.</font>

869
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,670
<font color="yellow">He seems so.</font>

870
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,010
<font color="yellow">In fact, the shapes of his eyebrows...</font>

871
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,440
<font color="yellow">and the area between the eyebrows...</font>

872
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,870
<font color="yellow">indicate that he is a man who would love a woman forever...</font>

873
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,740
<font color="yellow">once he falls in love with her.</font>

874
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,240
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree, President Yeo?</font>

875
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:22,070
<font color="yellow">I guess. I don't know much about physiognomy.</font>

876
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,610
<font color="yellow">He has a face of a man...</font>

877
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,640
<font color="yellow">who would be a good husband as well as a good boyfriend.</font>

878
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you for this, Manager Jang.</font>

879
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,740
<font color="yellow">I'll get back to work.</font>

880
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,470
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go on now.</font>

881
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,770
<font color="yellow">Just as I expected, she can't hide her feelings.</font>

882
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,010
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo, we have an emergency.</font>

883
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,170
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

884
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,110
<font color="yellow">I think Manager Jang has noticed.</font>

885
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,810
<font color="yellow">- What has he noticed? - You startled me.</font>

886
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,670
<font color="yellow">I mean, he seems to suspect us.</font>

887
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,040
<font color="yellow">He went on talking about weird things with President Yeo.</font>

888
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,340
<font color="yellow">I think he might spread a weird rumor in this hospital.</font>

889
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:09,010
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

890
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:13,340
<font color="yellow">Let's have a fight.</font>

891
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,740
<font color="yellow">- Fight? - Yes.</font>

892
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,570
<font color="yellow">Let's fight more intensely.</font>

893
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,240
<font color="yellow">Let's make it look like a real fight.</font>

894
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:22,570
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon.</font>

895
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,770
<font color="yellow">Why did you give the patient an analgesic first?</font>

896
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,410
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang, it's because I...</font>

897
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,570
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that the patient is in pain?</font>

898
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,370
<font color="yellow">- The patient was in so much pain... - I wasn't far from here.</font>

899
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,040
<font color="yellow">I can come here from my office in only two minutes.</font>

900
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,240
<font color="yellow">You should have called me first.</font>

901
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,870
<font color="yellow">I could have checked if it was surgical abdomen.</font>

902
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,910
<font color="yellow">Right. I thought of that, too, but...</font>

903
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,640
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that analgesics...</font>

904
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,070
<font color="yellow">except for NSAIDs don't affect physical examination?</font>

905
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,640
<font color="yellow">- I do. That's why I gave an order. - In case of an acute abdomen,</font>

906
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,940
<font color="yellow">call a surgeon first from now on.</font>

907
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,440
<font color="yellow">The emergency room isn't a control room for the hospital.</font>

908
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,070
<font color="yellow">The doctors in here are...</font>

909
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,540
<font color="yellow">also good enough to make decision.</font>

910
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,410
<font color="yellow">Do you want to start a fight between GS and ER doctor?</font>

911
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,410
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

912
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,970
<font color="yellow">Stop acting up. I'm your senior.</font>

913
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,470
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you two?</font>

914
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,410
<font color="yellow">I told you, it was my fault.</font>

915
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,370
<font color="yellow">- It's not your fault! - It's not your fault!</font>

916
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,340
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo and Seo Jung...</font>

917
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,740
<font color="yellow">squabble every time they see each other.</font>

918
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,410
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

919
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,740
<font color="yellow">- That's fake. - You startled me.</font>

920
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,640
<font color="yellow">Fake? What do you mean?</font>

921
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,840
<font color="yellow">They're trying to hide the fact that they're a couple.</font>

922
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,870
<font color="yellow">The fight is a cover-up.</font>

923
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,370
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

924
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,670
<font color="yellow">Don't jump to a conclusion. That's not true.</font>

925
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,570
<font color="yellow">What would you do if I'm right?</font>

926
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,270
<font color="yellow">You can have a free drink at my bar for one month.</font>

927
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,270
<font color="yellow">Free food, too.</font>

928
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,040
<font color="yellow">All right. Food is free, too.</font>

929
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,240
<font color="yellow">Why would you two make a bet...</font>

930
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,640
<font color="yellow">on whether they are a couple or not?</font>

931
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,910
<font color="yellow">- It's fun. - It's fun.</font>

932
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,640
<font color="yellow">It's from Master Kim.</font>

933
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,210
<font color="yellow">I can't seem to get along with you.</font>

934
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,370
<font color="yellow">Everyone, please be seated.</font>

935
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,340
<font color="yellow">What is going on, Master Kim?</font>

936
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,740
<font color="yellow">As of today,</font>

937
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,910
<font color="yellow">the meeting on Chairman Shin's surgery...</font>

938
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,070
<font color="yellow">will be suspended.</font>

939
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,140
<font color="yellow">What do you mean...</font>

940
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,610
<font color="yellow">the meeting will be suspended?</font>

941
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,640
<font color="yellow">The CT scan result came out.</font>

942
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,670
<font color="yellow">He has terminal lung cancer.</font>

943
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,470
<font color="yellow">Terminal lung cancer.</font>

944
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,940
<font color="yellow">Considering his condition,</font>

945
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,910
<font color="yellow">the artificial heart replacement surgery...</font>

946
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,440
<font color="yellow">would be too much for the patient.</font>

947
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,940
<font color="yellow">Therefore, everything we have...</font>

948
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,340
<font color="yellow">May we come in?</font>

949
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:05,210
<font color="yellow">It's okay. You don't have to get up.</font>

950
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,910
<font color="yellow">Are these people the staff members who will participate...</font>

951
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,370
<font color="yellow">in my surgery?</font>

952
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chairman Shin.</font>

953
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,870
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

954
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,670
<font color="yellow">They all look trustworthy.</font>

955
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,810
<font color="yellow">- Don't you think so? - Yes, I agree with you.</font>

956
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,210
<font color="yellow">I was discussing...</font>

957
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:35,770
<font color="yellow">your surgery with them.</font>

958
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,440
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

959
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,470
<font color="yellow">In fact, I came down here...</font>

960
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,970
<font color="yellow">to talk about it.</font>

961
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,940
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim. - Yes?</font>

962
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:55,910
<font color="yellow">Let us...</font>

963
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:00,640
<font color="yellow">stick to our original plan.</font>

964
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:02,910
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

965
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,310
<font color="yellow">Just as we planned,</font>

966
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:11,970
<font color="yellow">let's proceed with the surgery.</font>

967
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,740
<font color="yellow">Chairman Shin.</font>

968
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,910
<font color="yellow">Since things turned out this way,</font>

969
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,970
<font color="yellow">how about you become the chairman?</font>

970
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,140
<font color="yellow">What do you say?</font>

971
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,010
<font color="yellow">I think Geodae Hospital needs...</font>

972
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,610
<font color="yellow">a young chairman at this juncture.</font>

973
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,810
<font color="yellow">You call me a greedy old man...</font>

974
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,270
<font color="yellow">or say that I'm senile.</font>

975
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,440
<font color="yellow">Even if...</font>

976
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,470
<font color="yellow">I have only one day left to live,</font>

977
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:54,670
<font color="yellow">I want to breathe comfortably.</font>

978
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,470
<font color="yellow">I'm going to die anyway.</font>

979
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,840
<font color="yellow">It's not too much to ask of you, is it?</font>

980
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,940
<font color="yellow">Right, Master Kim?</font>

981
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,340
<font color="yellow">(Dr. Romantic)</font>

982
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,510
<font color="yellow">Has Boo Yong Joo decided to perform the surgery?</font>

983
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,440
<font color="yellow">Do you think President Do will just let Master Kim do that?</font>

984
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,040
<font color="yellow">He could put everyone at Doldam Hospital in trouble.</font>

985
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,040
<font color="yellow">I will offer him two propositions.</font>

986
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,540
<font color="yellow">The staff members will be replaced?</font>

987
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,940
<font color="yellow">With the staff from Geodae Hospital?</font>

988
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,010
<font color="yellow">Boo Yong Joo...</font>

989
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,840
<font color="yellow">Why don't you change the staff members?</font>

990
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,810
<font color="yellow">He will never give up on his staff.</font>

991
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,640
<font color="yellow">If you can't change the staff,</font>

992
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,370
<font color="yellow">you have to accept another offer. Are you sure you'll be okay?</font>

993
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,810
<font color="yellow">Now I just have to...</font>

994
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,840
<font color="yellow">eliminate him from this industry for good.</font>

995
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,070
<font color="yellow">(Epilogue)</font>

996
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,970
<font color="yellow">Are you tired?</font>

997
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,970
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dr. Yoon.</font>

998
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,540
<font color="yellow">That's pretty.</font>

999
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,070
<font color="yellow">Did someone give it to you as a gift?</font>

1000
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,170
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>
