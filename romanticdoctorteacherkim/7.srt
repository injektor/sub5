<font color="yellow">for Doldam Hospital by President Do.</font>

160
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:41,165
<font color="yellow">Let's give it our best shot.</font>

161
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,895
<font color="yellow">I will make sure to do my best.</font>

162
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:47,095
<font color="yellow">I'm ready to put my life on the line for the future of Doldam Hospital.</font>

163
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:50,125
<font color="yellow">- Speaking of which, - Yes, sir.</font>

164
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:53,425
<font color="yellow">I'd like to know more about Doldam Hospital in detail.</font>

165
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:56,825
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - Like some inside stories...</font>

166
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:59,425

<font color="yellow">it seems...</font>

169
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:05,125
<font color="yellow">Master Kim is a pivotal figure in this hospital.</font>

170
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:09,325
<font color="yellow">Is there any unstable factors of him?</font>

171
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,725
<font color="yellow">Unstable factors?</font>

172
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:16,695
<font color="yellow">Me? Are you talking to me?</font>

173
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,155
<font color="yellow">Yes, you.</font>

174
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,695
<font color="yellow">What is your position in this hospital?</font>

175
00:11:24,695 --> 00:11:26,925
<font color="yellow">Well, I am...</font>

<font color="yellow">You are an orderly.</font>

178
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,125
<font color="yellow">on the board for emergency medicine.</font>

179
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:36,795
<font color="yellow">Actually, on the double board for cardiothoracic surgery.</font>

180
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:43,395
<font color="yellow">Maybe you are a hidden medical expert in this hospital.</font>

181
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:48,325
<font color="yellow">No, I wouldn't say that. I just try to work hard...</font>

182
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:49,395
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

183
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:52,255
<font color="yellow">I will consider that for further tasks.</font>

184
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:55,925
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter what it is.</font>

185
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:59,195
<font color="yellow">If you have anything that can finish Master Kim,</font>

186
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:03,195
<font color="yellow">I want you to share it with me.</font>

187
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,525
<font color="yellow">Finish Master Kim with a single blow?</font>

188
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,195
<font color="yellow">If things go well with that,</font>

189
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:11,555
<font color="yellow">I will recommend you for a position at Geodae Hospital.</font>

190
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,355
<font color="yellow">Just think about it.</font>

191
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:16,555
<font color="yellow">We still have plenty of time.</font>

192
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:25,055
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to do anything with them?</font>

193
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,825
<font color="yellow">Just let it go.</font>

194
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:29,425
<font color="yellow">It is so obvious...</font>

195
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,355
<font color="yellow">why they came all the way here.</font>

196
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:34,525
<font color="yellow">But what can we do? They say they came to support us.</font>

197
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,125
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let them stab you in the back again?</font>

198
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:40,525
<font color="yellow">You are not alone this time.</font>

199
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:42,595
<font color="yellow">The whole staff of Doldam Hospital is at stake.</font>

200
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,125
<font color="yellow">I know that. You just startled me.</font>

201
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,655
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you know that?</font>

202
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,325
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I know that. So please just forget about it.</font>

203
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,795
<font color="yellow">Do you know that there will be no hospital you can go...</font>

204
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:04,355
<font color="yellow">other than here?</font>

205
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:20,225
<font color="yellow">Where are you taking that device?</font>

206
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:22,955
<font color="yellow">Now that we have a new one, I'm taking it to the storage.</font>

207
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:25,425
<font color="yellow">Who is she, by the way?</font>

208
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,955
<font color="yellow">She will be working here for a while.</font>

209
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:29,795
<font color="yellow">Her name is Woo Yeon Hwa.</font>

210
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,155
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

211
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:33,955
<font color="yellow">Hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Seo Jung.</font>

212
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:35,895
<font color="yellow">Where is the new device?</font>

213
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:38,425
<font color="yellow">- It's in the hybrid room. - Okay.</font>

214
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,995
<font color="yellow">She is my second favorite person at the hospital after Ms. Oh.</font>

215
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,095
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

216
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:58,325
<font color="yellow">Look at the ultrasound device.</font>

217
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:02,025
<font color="yellow">Is this hospital beyond the space and time?</font>

218
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,355
<font color="yellow">It's not the Stone Age now.</font>

219
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:05,595
<font color="yellow">I just saw the old device earlier today.</font>

220
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,625
<font color="yellow">- This is so cool. - Is it a relic of the past or what?</font>

221
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,095
<font color="yellow">Chest portable device? Are you here, too?</font>

222
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,055
<font color="yellow">It's so nice to see you again.</font>

223
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:15,595
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy.</font>

224
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:18,695
<font color="yellow">It is a miracle that you could actually save a life in here.</font>

225
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:21,495
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

226
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,995
<font color="yellow">It's an external cooling device.</font>

227
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,225
<font color="yellow">Therapeutic hypothermia is popular these days.</font>

228
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:30,425
<font color="yellow">It became famous after they used it for a president of a conglomerate.</font>

229
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,925
<font color="yellow">Hello, you are new. It's nice to meet you.</font>

230
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:36,295
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you a question.</font>

231
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:39,195
<font color="yellow">Why have you been stuck in this hospital for the past five years?</font>

232
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,695
<font color="yellow">Beautiful mountains, clean water, and fresh air.</font>

233
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:43,955
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - And Master Kim.</font>

234
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:46,525
<font color="yellow">Have you heard of the name? He is a legendary surgeon.</font>

235
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,225
<font color="yellow">He was once a legendary surgeon.</font>

236
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,025
<font color="yellow">He is still a legendary surgeon.</font>

237
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:54,025
<font color="yellow">I know things will get tough, but once you get through it all,</font>

238
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,695
<font color="yellow">your life will be changed.</font>

239
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,095
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want a change.</font>

240
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:00,395
<font color="yellow">Me being here...</font>

241
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:02,925
<font color="yellow">is the worst change that has ever happen to me in my life.</font>

242
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:06,395
<font color="yellow">The whole thing is a complete mess. I don't want to go through anything.</font>

243
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:08,995
<font color="yellow">Where do you want to put the ECMO?</font>

244
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:11,095
<font color="yellow">ECMO?</font>

245
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:14,095
<font color="yellow">Do we have a new ECMO? I can't believe this.</font>

246
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:17,755
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty.</font>

247
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,295
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

248
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:21,795
<font color="yellow">She's dancing.</font>

249
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,495
<font color="yellow">- I feel like crying. - Please put it here.</font>

250
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:33,025
<font color="yellow">This is so good.</font>

251
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:35,695
<font color="yellow">- Are you happy? - Aren't you happy?</font>

252
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,325
<font color="yellow">Where should I put this?</font>

253
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:48,695
<font color="yellow">Hello? This is Master Kim speaking.</font>

254
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,225
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

255
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:54,295
<font color="yellow">receive the devices?</font>

256
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:58,195
<font color="yellow">Yes, I received them all.</font>

257
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:00,525
<font color="yellow">My work is done here.</font>

<font color="yellow">I will give you a call as soon as we are ready.</font>

263
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:17,355
<font color="yellow">Just make it quick.</font>

264
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,395
<font color="yellow">Give me a call.</font>

265
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:25,755
<font color="yellow">He's such a jerk.</font>

266
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,355
<font color="yellow">He's never scared of me.</font>

267
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:32,295
<font color="yellow">That's why you like him.</font>

268
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,095
<font color="yellow">This is jujube tea.</font>

274
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,195
<font color="yellow">I'm more used to using a knife.</font>

275
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:06,055
<font color="yellow">Are you really a doctor?</font>

276
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,655
<font color="yellow">How many patients have you killed?</font>

277

311
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:51,055
<font color="yellow">We need the portable chest X-ray.</font>

312
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,555
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

313
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:55,225
<font color="yellow">We have an emergency patient.</font>

314
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,495
<font color="yellow">Let's move him. In 1, 2, 3.</font>

315
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:14,555
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon, cover up his wound,</font>

316
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,325
<font color="yellow">and figure out his personal information.</font>

317
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:17,755
<font color="yellow">Call the general surgeons.</font>

318
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:20,025
<font color="yellow">- Both Dong Joo and the new guy. - Okay.</font>

319
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:21,425
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Dr. Geodae. - Yes.</font>

320
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,125
<font color="yellow">- Both of you can follow me. - Yes.</font>

321
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,525
<font color="yellow">I need a dressing set...</font>

322
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,055
<font color="yellow">- and a six-inch eb. - Okay.</font>

323
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:27,625
<font color="yellow">Also, can you see if he has a wallet...</font>

324
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,925
<font color="yellow">- and a phone? - Okay.</font>

325
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:30,895
<font color="yellow">Can anyone call the general surgeons for me?</font>

326
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,195
<font color="yellow">- Call both Dr. Kang and Dr. Do. - I will.</font>

327
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:35,825
<font color="yellow">I will get them.</font>

328
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:39,325
<font color="yellow">She's very quick.</font>

329
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:40,925
<font color="yellow">Yes, and she's nice.</font>

330
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:45,955
<font color="yellow">- You shocked me. - I'm sorry.</font>

331
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,395
<font color="yellow">We have an emergency patient.</font>

332
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:52,895
<font color="yellow">An emergency patient?</font>

333
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,095
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dr. Kang.</font>

334
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:02,325
<font color="yellow">This hospital is worse than I thought.</font>

335
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:06,755
<font color="yellow">How can he think of doing a surgery for the chairman here?</font>

336
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:10,425
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

337
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,395
<font color="yellow">have you made your decision?</font>

338
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:15,255
<font color="yellow">Which side will you take?</font>

339
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,195
<font color="yellow">Me or Boo Yong Joo?</font>

340
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,125
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dr. Do.</font>

341
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:24,325
<font color="yellow">Are you all settled in?</font>

342
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,295
<font color="yellow">What about the office? Is it okay?</font>

343
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:28,925
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

344
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:29,955
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

345
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:32,095
<font color="yellow">It's just fine.</font>

346
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,595
<font color="yellow">What can we do? We should do our job as long as we are here.</font>

347
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:38,555
<font color="yellow">Let's get to work.</font>

348
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,425
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to you later.</font>

349
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:43,695
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

350
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,895
<font color="yellow">Are you still taking sides?</font>

351
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:56,295
<font color="yellow">Then what are you doing here?</font>

352
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,495
<font color="yellow">I haven't got any connections or families,</font>

353
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,225
<font color="yellow">but your father is the president.</font>

354
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:05,855
<font color="yellow">How did you end up here?</font>

355
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:08,795
<font color="yellow">I did not end up here. I'm just here for an experience.</font>

356
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,255
<font color="yellow">I can go back whenever I wish.</font>

357
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,125
<font color="yellow">Unlike you.</font>

358
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,325
<font color="yellow">Apart from your father,</font>

359
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,495
<font color="yellow">is there anything that's better than me?</font>

360
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:30,195
<font color="yellow">If you have anything, show me.</font>

361
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:33,495
<font color="yellow">Prove yourself.</font>

362
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,355
<font color="yellow">For once.</font>

363
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,995
<font color="yellow">Go and win against Dong Joo just once.</font>

364
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:40,995
<font color="yellow">You're awful.</font>

365
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:43,695
<font color="yellow">I'm just awful, but you're awful and terrible.</font>

366
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,125
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

367
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:48,655
<font color="yellow">Do you want to hit me?</font>

368
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:51,525
<font color="yellow">You're not even worth it.</font>

369
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:53,425
<font color="yellow">It'll only hurt my hand.</font>

370
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:57,725
<font color="yellow">You don't need to save your hand. You're bad at surgeries.</font>

371
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:07,495
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

372
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:13,495
<font color="yellow">You are wanted at the emergency room.</font>

373
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:22,095
<font color="yellow">Your lips are bleeding.</font>

374
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:27,155
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

375
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:30,795
<font color="yellow">Aren't you a general surgeon?</font>

376
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:34,525
<font color="yellow">Master Kim wanted you there, too.</font>

377
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:40,695
<font color="yellow">Ventricular fibrillation. Compression.</font>

378
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:44,795
<font color="yellow">Give me 200J.</font>

379
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:47,655
<font color="yellow">- We're ready. - Move away.</font>

380
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,095
<font color="yellow">Shock.</font>

381
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,395
<font color="yellow">Compression.</font>

382
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:58,795
<font color="yellow">Let's perform intubation.</font>

383
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:05,425
<font color="yellow">Tube, please.</font>

384
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:09,425
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

385
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:11,595
<font color="yellow">Stethoscope.</font>

386
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,355
<font color="yellow">Move away.</font>

387
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:19,555
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

388
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,295
<font color="yellow">Give him 1mm of epinephrine every 3 minutes.</font>

389
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:24,525
<font color="yellow">Also, squeeze an ambu bag every 6 seconds.</font>

390
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:25,625
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

391
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:27,025
<font color="yellow">Two minutes passed.</font>

392
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:28,725
<font color="yellow">Switch hands and check his pulse.</font>

393
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,325
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

394
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:33,855
<font color="yellow">No pulse, he's in PEA.</font>

395
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:35,095
<font color="yellow">You, compression.</font>

396
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:37,755
<font color="yellow">When was he reported?</font>

397
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:39,495
<font color="yellow">It was 3:48pm.</font>

398
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:42,425
<font color="yellow">He was at a bus stop, and he suddenly collapsed.</font>

399
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:43,595
<font color="yellow">Someone called the 911,</font>

400
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:47,355
<font color="yellow">and the witness was performing a CPR on him.</font>

401
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:48,525
<font color="yellow">What was his initial treatment?</font>

402
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,755
<font color="yellow">We performed ventricular fibrillation on him twice.</font>

403
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,095
<font color="yellow">That's 17 minutes before he arrived here.</font>

404
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:55,325
<font color="yellow">Do you have his information?</font>

405
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:58,025
<font color="yellow">He had an ID, so we talked to his wife.</font>

406
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:59,925
<font color="yellow">She's on her way here.</font>

407
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:01,925
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

408
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,995
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kim, he has another wound on his back.</font>

409
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:09,995
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Dr. Geodae. - Yes, Dr. Geodae here.</font>

410
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:12,155
<font color="yellow">Continue to perform compression until he comes back.</font>

411
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:14,295
<font color="yellow">- Don't give up. - Okay.</font>

412
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,155
<font color="yellow">Let's check his pulse.</font>

413
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:18,395
<font color="yellow">He's still in asystole.</font>

414
00:25:18,655 --> 00:25:19,895
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

415
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:27,425
<font color="yellow">It looks like it's somewhere in the thoracolumbar junction.</font>

416
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:29,695
<font color="yellow">I felt something hard inside.</font>

417
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:32,895
<font color="yellow">I think this is a knife blade.</font>

418
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:37,555
<font color="yellow">It must have broke when he was stabbed.</font>

419
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:41,755
<font color="yellow">Where are the surgeons?</font>

420
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:43,195
<font color="yellow">They are so slow.</font>

421
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:45,425
<font color="yellow">Drag them if you have to.</font>

422
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:46,595
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim.</font>

423
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:48,895
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late?</font>

424
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:53,225
<font color="yellow">- What's his case? - He's a stabbed patient.</font>

425
00:25:53,355 --> 00:25:54,695
<font color="yellow">He was stabbed five times in his stomach,</font>

426
00:25:54,695 --> 00:25:56,995
<font color="yellow">and there is a knife blade stuck in the thoracolumbar junction.</font>

427
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,295
<font color="yellow">What about nerve injuries?</font>

428
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,195
<font color="yellow">Both of his lower motors do not seem well.</font>

429
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,325
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your lips?</font>

430
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,525
<font color="yellow">- What about his stomach? - He has two bowel perforations.</font>

431
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:10,425
<font color="yellow">We can't see if it's his small bowel or large bowel through the CT.</font>

432
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:13,155
<font color="yellow">His sonogram showed that the wounds are close to his vessels.</font>

433
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,225
<font color="yellow">It's toward his vessels as well.</font>

434
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:19,125
<font color="yellow">- Did you fight with someone? - I'm not a kid.</font>

435
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:24,925
<font color="yellow">What's with him?</font>

436
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:27,555
<font color="yellow">Is he sulking because of that?</font>

437
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:32,895
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dr. Song.</font>

438
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,355
<font color="yellow">We need you in the emergency room.</font>

439
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,295
<font color="yellow">- Dad! - Honey!</font>

440
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:39,795
<font color="yellow">- Honey! - May I help you?</font>

441
00:26:39,795 --> 00:26:43,355
<font color="yellow">We got the call saying my dad collapsed at a bus stop.</font>

442
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,125
<font color="yellow">They said he was transferred to Doldam Hospital.</font>

443
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,155
<font color="yellow">Our doctors are treating him right now.</font>

444
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:48,795
<font color="yellow">Please wait over there.</font>

445
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:51,055
<font color="yellow">How could this happen?</font>

446
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:54,395
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Don't cry, Mom.</font>

447
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:58,095
<font color="yellow">Checking heart rhythm.</font>

448
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:06,395
<font color="yellow">He has a pulse. It's an ROSC.</font>

449
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,025
<font color="yellow">The blood pressure is between 60 to 90.</font>

450
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,095
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

451
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:13,195
<font color="yellow">- He needs saline, too. - What?</font>

452
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:17,395
<font color="yellow">Right. I need saline.</font>

453
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,695
<font color="yellow">- That's the one. - Right.</font>

454
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:25,025
<font color="yellow">It's not looking good.</font>

455
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:29,895
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang is here.</font>

456
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:32,425
<font color="yellow">Why did you come alone? Where's the other guy?</font>

457
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:34,425
<font color="yellow">The other guy? Who?</font>

458
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:37,695
<font color="yellow">Medical team of general surgery from Geodae Hospital came down here.</font>

459
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:40,395
<font color="yellow">I wasn't expecting that from President Do.</font>

460
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:44,525
<font color="yellow">I asked you where the other guy is. We paged you both.</font>

461
00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:46,995
<font color="yellow">I don't really know where he is.</font>

462
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:48,155
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

463
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:03,355
<font color="yellow">He's a John Doe.</font>

464
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,325
<font color="yellow">He has five wounds in his abdomen.</font>

465
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:08,855
<font color="yellow">The three on his right are light wounds, but the other ones aren't.</font>

466
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:09,955
<font color="yellow">He has perforated bowel.</font>

467
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,855
<font color="yellow">Blade of the knife broke...</font>

468
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:13,655
<font color="yellow">in the right side of his abdomen.</font>

469
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:15,355
<font color="yellow">Will this call for combine operation?</font>

470
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:16,695
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

471
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,695
<font color="yellow">- Where should we start? - With his abdomen.</font>

472
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:21,055
<font color="yellow">He might not be able to walk again,</font>

473
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:22,395
<font color="yellow">but at least he won't die.</font>

474
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:23,555
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

475
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:26,725
<font color="yellow">I'll go prepare for a different operation, then.</font>

476
00:28:27,395 --> 00:28:28,425
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

477
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:30,495
<font color="yellow">I just got the call.</font>

478
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:33,725
<font color="yellow">Are you going to operate on a John Doe patient?</font>

479
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:37,325
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

480
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,725
<font color="yellow">His injuries are too dangerous to be operated here.</font>

481
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:42,355
<font color="yellow">Don't waste your time on him.</font>

482
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,595
<font color="yellow">I suggest you transfer him to a bigger hospital.</font>

483
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:47,725
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter how big or small a hospital is.</font>

484
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:48,995
<font color="yellow">It's the surgeon who treats the patient.</font>

485
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:51,395
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried that it might go wrong.</font>

486
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,095
<font color="yellow">What will happen if we operate without the guardian's consent...</font>

487
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:57,225
<font color="yellow">and the operation doesn't go well?</font>

488
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:00,055
<font color="yellow">It's not like we can ask you to take...</font>

489
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:02,155
<font color="yellow">full responsibility and resign.</font>

490
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,155
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

491
00:29:14,495 --> 00:29:16,855
<font color="yellow">According to the Emergency Medical Service Act,</font>

492
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,925
<font color="yellow">in case the emergency patient is not capable of making decisions...</font>

493
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:21,695
<font color="yellow">and when there isn't a guardian to ask for consent,</font>

494
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:24,725
<font color="yellow">an exception is made to ask for consent.</font>

495
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:33,025
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

496
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:37,725
<font color="yellow">Hey. Did you hear that?</font>

497
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:42,195
<font color="yellow">It's the law.</font>

498
00:29:46,195 --> 00:29:47,295
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

499
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:50,325
<font color="yellow">Move him to the operating room. Can you set the place up?</font>

500
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:51,395
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

501
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,825
<font color="yellow">- Do In Beom, was it? - Yes.</font>

502
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:59,855
<font color="yellow">You will perform the surgery. Dr. Kang is the assistant.</font>

503
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:01,525
<font color="yellow">Why am I the assistant?</font>

504
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:02,595
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

505
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:05,355
<font color="yellow">Are you not up for it? Suit yourself, then.</font>

506
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:06,855
<font color="yellow">Can I fill in his spot?</font>

507
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:09,525
<font color="yellow">You should help them treat the cardiac arrest patient.</font>

508
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:13,295
<font color="yellow">I'll treat the spine. That will be all.</font>

509
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:19,955
<font color="yellow">Did you see that?</font>

510
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:21,625
<font color="yellow">He's like that.</font>

511
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:25,695
<font color="yellow">The smell of human blood makes him go crazy.</font>

512
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:26,895
<font color="yellow">Like a mad man.</font>

513
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,595
<font color="yellow">Let's move the patient, Mr. Park.</font>

514
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:30,755
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

515
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:34,625
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Coming through.</font>

516
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:37,295
<font color="yellow">Hey. Be careful.</font>

517
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:38,795
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

518
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:42,625
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Go after Master Kim.</font>

519
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:46,855
<font color="yellow">I can take care of my own business. I'm not a child, you know.</font>

520
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:53,795
<font color="yellow">You're one to hold grudges.</font>

521
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:56,755
<font color="yellow">Are men all like that, Mr. Park?</font>

522
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:57,855
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

523
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,555
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

524
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:07,525
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

525
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:11,225
<font color="yellow">Watch where you're going.</font>

526
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:15,855
<font color="yellow">Are you blind or something?</font>

527
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:23,555
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

528
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:30,555
<font color="yellow">It's waterproofed. Bandage up your hand.</font>

529
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,225
<font color="yellow">You can't go in the operating room with an open wound.</font>

530
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,195
<font color="yellow">Did I do something wrong to deserve this?</font>

531
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,795
<font color="yellow">I won't know if you don't tell me.</font>

532
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,655
<font color="yellow">What don't you like about me?</font>

533
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:46,125
<font color="yellow">Your very existence.</font>

534
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:48,295
<font color="yellow">Satisfied?</font>

535
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:50,295
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

536
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,125
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that?</font>

537
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:54,595
<font color="yellow">Did I do something wrong?</font>

538
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,355
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me. - Tell me.</font>

539
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:59,225
<font color="yellow">Why don't you like my very existence?</font>

540
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:02,825
<font color="yellow">Are you asking because you don't know?</font>

541
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,355
<font color="yellow">Is there something I should be aware of?</font>

542
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,295
<font color="yellow">Are you playing innocent or just plain rude?</font>

543
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,325
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

544
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:14,155
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

545
00:32:14,925 --> 00:32:17,325
<font color="yellow">Even when your dad is the president of Geodae Hospital,</font>

546
00:32:18,595 --> 00:32:20,025
<font color="yellow">you won't be comfortable with other people knowing...</font>

547
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:24,025
<font color="yellow">that you're born out of wedlock, right?</font>

548
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:28,995
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

549
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:31,155
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I understand.</font>

550
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:33,795
<font color="yellow">I'll pretend to understand.</font>

551
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:38,195
<font color="yellow">So stop bothering me from now on.</font>

552
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,155
<font color="yellow">Born out of wedlock?</font>

553
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:49,255
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

554
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,125
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

555
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,125
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

556
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:57,325
<font color="yellow">Does he think...</font>

557
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:11,395
<font color="yellow">Don't use your fist when you get in a fight in the future.</font>

558
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,425
<font color="yellow">If you really feel like beating someone up, just kick him.</font>

559
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:18,995
<font color="yellow">Or you could just take the beating.</font>

560
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:20,595
<font color="yellow">Why me?</font>

561
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:22,425
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

562
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:24,955
<font color="yellow">You had me come down here.</font>

563
00:33:25,595 --> 00:33:27,925
<font color="yellow">And now you're asking me to perform a surgery.</font>

564
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:30,695
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you think I'm trying to...</font>

565
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:34,055
<font color="yellow">use you to get back at your father?</font>

566
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:35,795
<font color="yellow">Aren't you?</font>

567
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:39,125
<font color="yellow">Stop your nonsense and focus on the operation.</font>

568
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,255
<font color="yellow">Where's Dr. Kang? Why isn't he here?</font>

569
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,225
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

570
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:51,925
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

571
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:16,525
<font color="yellow">Page Dr. Kang again.</font>

572
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:18,655
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - There's no need.</font>

573
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:21,825
<font color="yellow">I'll be the assistant today.</font>

574
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:28,895
<font color="yellow">Master Kim as an assistant?</font>

575
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,195
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

576
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,695
<font color="yellow">He's here. Dr. Kang.</font>

577
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:37,925
<font color="yellow">Sorry I'm late.</font>

578
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,595
<font color="yellow">Get out of here. We don't need you here.</font>

579
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:46,195
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim. - I said we don't need you here.</font>

580
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:51,695
<font color="yellow">Let's get started.</font>

581
00:35:51,795 --> 00:35:54,355
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim. - Show me what you've got.</font>

582
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:56,995
<font color="yellow">Let's see how good you are.</font>

583
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:59,725
<font color="yellow">Commencing operation.</font>

584
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:01,425
<font color="yellow">Scalpel.</font>

585
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,055
<font color="yellow">Bovie.</font>

586
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:27,725
<font color="yellow">Focus.</font>

587
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:29,825
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

588
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,225
<font color="yellow">His heart is back,</font>

589
00:36:32,655 --> 00:36:34,925
<font color="yellow">but I don't think he will wake up.</font>

590
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:38,095
<font color="yellow">Even if he does, he won't be able to perform normally.</font>

591
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:42,295
<font color="yellow">- What about his brain? - There is no hypoxic damage.</font>

592
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:45,655
<font color="yellow">If his brain is fine,</font>

593
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,555
<font color="yellow">- shouldn't you try TTM? - TTM?</font>

594
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:51,495
<font color="yellow">That's too expensive. It won't be easy.</font>

595
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,595
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to his wife.</font>

596
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:57,295
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

597
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:01,095
<font color="yellow">- Targeted temperature management? - Yes.</font>

598
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,325
<font color="yellow">If one's heart stops for whatever reason,</font>

599
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:08,425
<font color="yellow">there is a high chance it will stop again within 24 hours.</font>

600
00:37:09,155 --> 00:37:11,495
<font color="yellow">So we performed a blood test and a brain CT scan...</font>

601
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,955
<font color="yellow">to find out why it stopped.</font>

602
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:14,295
<font color="yellow">A brain CT scan?</font>

603
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:17,725
<font color="yellow">Isn't that expensive?</font>

604
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:19,425
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you saying?</font>

605
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:20,725
<font color="yellow">These are the necessary procedures.</font>

606
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:21,995
<font color="yellow">And the result showed...</font>

607
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:25,095
<font color="yellow">he didn't have much brain damage.</font>

608
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,265
<font color="yellow">There is something...</font>

609
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,425
<font color="yellow">called targeted temperature management.</font>

610
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:32,625
<font color="yellow">We keep the patient's body temperature lower than normal...</font>

611
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:35,425
<font color="yellow">to prevent further brain damage.</font>

612
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:38,595
<font color="yellow">Will he wake up if we do this treatment?</font>

613
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,355
<font color="yellow">There is no guarantee.</font>

614
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,525
<font color="yellow">But to speak with numbers,</font>

615
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:49,395
<font color="yellow">when someone's heart stops outside of a hospital,</font>

616
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,295
<font color="yellow">only 4 out of 100 survive.</font>

617
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:54,195
<font color="yellow">Among them,</font>

618
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,155
<font color="yellow">only 1 out of the 100 can carry on...</font>

619
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,855
<font color="yellow">a normal life.</font>

620
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:01,395
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

621
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,495
<font color="yellow">What if we do this treatment?</font>

622
00:38:04,725 --> 00:38:06,495
<font color="yellow">The chances are twice as high.</font>

623
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,955
<font color="yellow">We'll do it.</font>

624
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:09,695
<font color="yellow">The problem is...</font>

625
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,525
<font color="yellow">the cost.</font>

626
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,325
<font color="yellow">How much does it cost?</font>

627
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:17,995
<font color="yellow">The cost of only the materials are 1,600 dollars.</font>

628
00:38:21,355 --> 00:38:23,625
<font color="yellow">We are actually very poor.</font>

629
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:27,295
<font color="yellow">We are eligible for medical care type one.</font>

630
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:31,495
<font color="yellow">But the materials of this treatment aren't approved by the medical care.</font>

631
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:34,195
<font color="yellow">You won't be covered for these.</font>

632
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:38,795
<font color="yellow">You have to pay this.</font>

633
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:42,325
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

634
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:44,725
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do?</font>

635
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:47,325
<font color="yellow">Please perform the treatment.</font>

636
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,595
<font color="yellow">- Seon Hwa, please. - Mom, don't worry.</font>

637
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,765
<font color="yellow">I'll find that money.</font>

638
00:38:52,925 --> 00:38:55,095
<font color="yellow">We probably have a lot to pay as of now.</font>

639
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:56,355
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

640
00:38:57,355 --> 00:39:00,495
<font color="yellow">Dad became like this after giving his everything for us.</font>

641
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:04,765
<font color="yellow">How sad will his life be if we can't do this for him?</font>

642
00:39:05,495 --> 00:39:06,525
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

643
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,495
<font color="yellow">Doctor, please do your best.</font>

644
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,055
<font color="yellow">Please save him.</font>

645
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:15,595
<font color="yellow">We'll do our best.</font>

646
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:17,355
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

647
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:19,555
<font color="yellow">That treatment is not insured.</font>

648
00:39:19,555 --> 00:39:20,725
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

649
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:23,055
<font color="yellow">Why is this important treatment still uninsured?</font>

650
00:39:23,055 --> 00:39:24,495
<font color="yellow">This isn't a plastic surgery.</font>

651
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:27,825
<font color="yellow">I don't know what they do in those high offices,</font>

652
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:29,195
<font color="yellow">but no.</font>

653
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:32,055
<font color="yellow">We're spending money on a patient with no hope.</font>

654
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,325
<font color="yellow">What if he doesn't wake up?</font>

655
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,795
<font color="yellow">His chances are only 8 to 100.</font>

656
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:36,795
<font color="yellow">If the chances are...</font>

657
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,795
<font color="yellow">as low as 1 to 100, should we try everything?</font>

658
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:40,995
<font color="yellow">What if it doesn't work?</font>

659
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,725
<font color="yellow">What will you do about his family's financial strain?</font>

660
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:45,925
<font color="yellow">What if they say that they can't pay?</font>

661
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:48,855
<font color="yellow">What will you do about the damages to the hospital?</font>

662
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:51,695
<font color="yellow">That's not for me to worry about. That's for those high officers.</font>

663
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:53,155
<font color="yellow">We treat patients,</font>

664
00:39:53,155 --> 00:39:55,025
<font color="yellow">and people in high offices fix this world.</font>

665
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:57,295
<font color="yellow">If you don't like what they do,</font>

666
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,425
<font color="yellow">you should one of them to fix this broken world.</font>

667
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:01,995
<font color="yellow">A doctor doesn't have the time for that.</font>

668
00:40:01,995 --> 00:40:03,655
<font color="yellow">Someone like you should step up, Mr. Jang.</font>

669
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:06,195
<font color="yellow">I'm Manager Jang, not Mr. Jang, Dr. Yoon.</font>

670
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:09,425
<font color="yellow">I've been promoted as a manger as of today.</font>

671
00:40:09,795 --> 00:40:11,795
<font color="yellow">Really? Congratulations.</font>

672
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:12,955
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

673
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:17,125
<font color="yellow">I will treat him, okay?</font>

674
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,125
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

675
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:20,055
<font color="yellow">Never. Not in this life.</font>

676
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:22,955
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Jang. - Manager. I'm Manager Jang.</font>

677
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:25,095
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Manager Jang.</font>

678
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:28,025
<font color="yellow">We have police officers here.</font>

679
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:30,765
<font color="yellow">I think they are here for that stabbed patient.</font>

680
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,225
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

681
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:34,765
<font color="yellow">No. Understood?</font>

682
00:40:39,795 --> 00:40:41,695
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jang, I mean, Manager Jang.</font>

683
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,155
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

684
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:48,995
<font color="yellow">- Let's do this. - Are we really doing this?</font>

685
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:50,895
<font color="yellow">Do you trust my instinct?</font>

686
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:54,395
<font color="yellow">I have a strong feeling that he will wake up. Let's do it.</font>

687
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:57,355
<font color="yellow">Will you take the responsibility if something goes wrong?</font>

688
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,265
<font color="yellow">Will you do this?</font>

689
00:40:59,695 --> 00:41:00,995
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much.</font>

690
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:02,855
<font color="yellow">I've just been called.</font>

691
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,855
<font color="yellow">- Thanks! - Hey.</font>

692
00:41:06,095 --> 00:41:07,095
<font color="yellow">Seo Jung!</font>

693
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:08,955
<font color="yellow">She's a Crazy Whale.</font>

694
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:12,295
<font color="yellow">I knew I should have never met you again.</font>

695
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:14,695
<font color="yellow">Where is this place?</font>

696
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:16,495
<font color="yellow">Who am I?</font>

697
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:18,055
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

698
00:41:24,595 --> 00:41:25,695
<font color="yellow">Miss.</font>

699
00:41:26,055 --> 00:41:28,225
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you be taking care of me?</font>

700
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:29,655
<font color="yellow">What's his case?</font>

701
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:32,995
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. He's asking us to give him a vitamin IV.</font>

702
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:34,265
<font color="yellow">We're already busy enough.</font>

703
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:36,225
<font color="yellow">- Is it him? - Yes.</font>

704
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:54,095
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's me.</font>

705
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:58,425
<font color="yellow">He's in a surgery right now.</font>

706
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:03,595
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

707
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,495
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of this.</font>

708
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,555
<font color="yellow">Make some soup, will you?</font>

709
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:10,155
<font color="yellow">Make sure you put in beef.</font>

710
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:11,895
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

711
00:42:16,725 --> 00:42:18,725
<font color="yellow">Sir, how are you doing?</font>

712
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:20,295
<font color="yellow">Bad.</font>

713
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:22,225
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

714
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:29,525
<font color="yellow">You look okay.</font>

715
00:42:29,525 --> 00:42:31,225
<font color="yellow">You can go home.</font>

716
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:32,265
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

717
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,295
<font color="yellow">Give me some IV.</font>

718
00:42:34,295 --> 00:42:36,995
<font color="yellow">Don't you have them with vitamin A, B, C, D, E, F, and G?</font>

719
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:39,125
<font color="yellow">Come on, get them on me.</font>

720
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,355
<font color="yellow">Let me fill up on my vitamins.</font>

721
00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:44,725
<font color="yellow">If you want nutritional IV, go to the outpatient clinic.</font>

722
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,925
<font color="yellow">You are awfully talkative.</font>

723
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:51,825
<font color="yellow">Just put me on IV if you don't want to die.</font>

724
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,155
<font color="yellow">You're the one who should leave while I'm still nice.</font>

725
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:58,155
<font color="yellow">If you don't, I'm calling the police.</font>

726
00:42:58,525 --> 00:42:59,655
<font color="yellow">Do you want them here?</font>

727
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:07,265
<font color="yellow">- Do you really want to die? - No way.</font>

728
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:08,765
<font color="yellow">I'd like to live a long life.</font>

729
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:10,855
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Goo. - Yes.</font>

730
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:11,995
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

731
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:14,425
<font color="yellow">He's leaving. Help him.</font>

732
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,765
<font color="yellow">Who is this Mr. Goo?</font>

733
00:43:34,055 --> 00:43:35,225
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

734
00:43:35,855 --> 00:43:37,025
<font color="yellow">Is the surgery over?</font>

735
00:43:37,725 --> 00:43:40,325
<font color="yellow">- I was kicked out. - Kicked out? Who kicked you out?</font>

736
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:43,955
<font color="yellow">Who would kick me out of the operating room?</font>

737
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:46,525
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

738
00:43:46,655 --> 00:43:49,795
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't walk out like this. You should have stayed.</font>

739
00:43:50,925 --> 00:43:52,055
<font color="yellow">Let me see that.</font>

740
00:43:53,795 --> 00:43:56,595
<font color="yellow">Master Kim always yells and embarrasses everyone.</font>

741
00:43:57,355 --> 00:43:59,655
<font color="yellow">I thought you would be used to him by now.</font>

742
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,325
<font color="yellow">That kind of a surgery is so rare.</font>

743
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:04,325
<font color="yellow">It would've helped you if you stuck around...</font>

744
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:07,225
<font color="yellow">to just watch what he does. Isn't that right?</font>

745
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:11,755
<font color="yellow">Go out with me, Seo Jung.</font>

746
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:18,195
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

747
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:21,395
<font color="yellow">I'll forget about...</font>

748
00:44:22,095 --> 00:44:24,225
<font color="yellow">how you called me as a kid and a teenager.</font>

749
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:25,995
<font color="yellow">Go out with me.</font>

750
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,955
<font color="yellow">You can't speak to me like this.</font>

751
00:44:36,395 --> 00:44:37,925
<font color="yellow">You're very bold.</font>

752
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:40,395
<font color="yellow">Is that a no?</font>

753
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,155
<font color="yellow">Forget about it.</font>

754
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:43,995
<font color="yellow">Go back to the operating room...</font>

755
00:44:44,325 --> 00:44:46,895
<font color="yellow">and tell him that you are sorry no matter what he says.</font>

756
00:44:47,195 --> 00:44:48,955
<font color="yellow">Tell him that you'll do your best...</font>

757
00:44:49,055 --> 00:44:51,695
<font color="yellow">even if all you do is assisting him.</font>

758
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:53,655
<font color="yellow">The third time's a charm.</font>

759
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,655
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you out two more times.</font>

760
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,425
<font color="yellow">So think about it.</font>

761
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:02,855
<font color="yellow">You did not listen to anything I said, did you?</font>

762
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:05,555
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

763
00:45:12,025 --> 00:45:15,055
<font color="yellow">One of them is asking me out all the time,</font>

764
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:18,025
<font color="yellow">and the other one is caught up in a family affair.</font>

765
00:45:19,395 --> 00:45:20,795
<font color="yellow">My life became so tiring.</font>

766
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:49,355
<font color="yellow">Things got very annoying thanks to that weird girl.</font>

767
00:45:51,955 --> 00:45:53,395
<font color="yellow">What a witch.</font>

768
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:59,325
<font color="yellow">The fine day will come</font>

769
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:01,525
<font color="yellow">Another glory day</font>

770
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:04,595
<font color="yellow">The fine day will come</font>

771
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:11,425
<font color="yellow">Hey, Sir.</font>

772
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:17,525
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

773
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:25,425
<font color="yellow">Do you have a lighter?</font>

774
00:46:27,225 --> 00:46:28,625
<font color="yellow">I don't smoke.</font>

775
00:46:33,195 --> 00:46:34,355
<font color="yellow">It's a non-smoking area.</font>

776
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:41,655
<font color="yellow">That doctor is such a jerk.</font>

777
00:46:54,025 --> 00:46:55,425
<font color="yellow">Where is Mr. Jang?</font>

778
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:58,225
<font color="yellow">He stepped out with the police officers.</font>

779
00:46:58,225 --> 00:47:00,195
<font color="yellow">- The police were here? - Yes.</font>

780
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:03,625
<font color="yellow">The patient who was stabbed with a knife. Remember?</font>

781
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,825
<font color="yellow">They assume that he got involved with gangsters.</font>

782
00:47:11,855 --> 00:47:14,355
<font color="yellow">Are you blind or something?</font>

783
00:47:14,495 --> 00:47:16,525
<font color="yellow">He's a stabbed patient.</font>

784
00:47:16,595 --> 00:47:17,955
<font color="yellow">He was stabbed five times in his stomach,</font>

785
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:20,225
<font color="yellow">and there is a knife blade stuck in the thoracolumbar junction.</font>

786
00:47:20,225 --> 00:47:23,825
<font color="yellow">The fine day will come, another glory day</font>

787
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:27,755
<font color="yellow">Where are Mr. Jang and the police officers?</font>

788
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:28,995
<font color="yellow">They're at the emergency room.</font>

789
00:47:37,795 --> 00:47:39,355
<font color="yellow">Where on earth are they?</font>

790
00:47:42,755 --> 00:47:44,955
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang, what are you doing here?</font>

791
00:47:45,755 --> 00:47:46,755
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jang.</font>

792
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:49,555
<font color="yellow">As of today, I'm the manager. I've been promoted.</font>

793

<font color="yellow">Where are the police officers?</font>

794
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:53,695
<font color="yellow">What? They already left.</font>

795
00:47:53,695 --> 00:47:55,225
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to tell them?</font>

796
00:47:56,355 --> 00:47:59,695
<font color="yellow">I think a gangster came into our hospital.</font>

797
00:48:00,655 --> 00:48:01,655
<font color="yellow">A gangster?</font>

798
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:03,625
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the stabbed patient?</font>

799
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:06,125
<font color="yellow">The police said he might be involved with gangsters.</font>

800
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:08,395
<font color="yellow">- Yes. So what? - Just before, I saw a man...</font>

801
00:48:08,655 --> 00:48:12,395
<font color="yellow">with something like a sickle wrapped in papers in the bathroom.</font>

802
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:17,325
<font color="yellow">Ask the police to come back, and tell all the staff members.</font>

803
00:48:17,425 --> 00:48:18,825
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the operating room.</font>

804
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:20,255
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

805
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:28,625
<font color="yellow">Hello? Is this the police? I'm calling from Doldam Hospital.</font>

806
00:48:31,225 --> 00:48:33,355
<font color="yellow">Dr. Song, it's me again.</font>

807
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:37,955
<font color="yellow">It seems like a lot happen in this hospital.</font>

808
00:48:38,825 --> 00:48:41,355

811
00:48:48,855 --> 00:48:50,355
<font color="yellow">Where is Dr. Yoon?</font>

812
00:48:50,655 --> 00:48:52,925
<font color="yellow">She's in the hybrid room with a patient.</font>

813
00:48:57,925 --> 00:48:58,955
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

814
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:02,855
<font color="yellow">I think a suspicious man is in our hospital now.</font>

815
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:04,925
<font color="yellow">Please protect everyone in the emergency room.</font>

816
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,295
<font color="yellow">Okay. Mr. Jang... I mean, Manager Jang already told me.</font>

817
00:49:08,395 --> 00:49:10,095
<font color="yellow">- Please don't worry. - Thank you.</font>

818
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,295
<font color="yellow">- I'm counting on you. - Okay.</font>

819
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,555
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and find the man.</font>

820
00:49:27,555 --> 00:49:28,925
<font color="yellow">Have you seen a man with a weapon?</font>

821
00:49:29,355 --> 00:49:30,795
<font color="yellow">Please stay calm.</font>

822
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:34,955
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

823
00:49:36,195 --> 00:49:37,495
<font color="yellow">Come in. Hurry.</font>

824
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,325
<font color="yellow">Search the room in every corner.</font>

825
00:50:07,355 --> 00:50:08,725
<font color="yellow">I think it's the small bowel.</font>

826

830
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:20,795
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

831
00:50:21,925 --> 00:50:24,225
<font color="yellow">- How is his condition? - Good so far.</font>

832
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,255
<font color="yellow">I found the bleeding focus.</font>

833

<font color="yellow">Hemostatic forceps.</font>

00:50:37,525 --> 00:50:38,725

<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

837
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:00,125
<font color="yellow">I told you to leave. Why did you come back?</font>

838
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,295
<font color="yellow">We have an emergency.</font>

839
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:04,655
<font color="yellow">Emergency? What do you mean?</font>

840
00:51:04,655 --> 00:51:08,295
<font color="yellow">I assume that the gangster who hurt this patient is in our hospital.</font>

841
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:09,325
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

842
00:51:09,825 --> 00:51:12,895
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid that gangster might barge in here?</font>

843

<font color="yellow">You never know.</font>

844
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:17,055

846
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,425
<font color="yellow">What? Hey.</font>

847
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,855
<font color="yellow">Even if the gangster comes in here,</font>

848
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,425
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't be of much help.</font>

849
00:51:37,425 --> 00:51:39,695
<font color="yellow">So just stop bothering me and get out of here.</font>

850

<font color="yellow">I'll stay here.</font>

851
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:45,855
<font color="yellow">Go back and tell hi that you are sorry no matter what he says.</font>

852
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,525
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong?</font>

853
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:59,425
<font color="yellow">I was late only for a few minutes. Is it that wrong?</font>

854
00:51:59,425 --> 00:52:00,925
<font color="yellow">You were late,</font>

855
00:52:01,095 --> 00:52:04,525
<font color="yellow">and you were even preoccupied when you came in here.</font>

856
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:05,695
<font color="yellow">I wasn't preoccupied.</font>

857
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:09,655
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking after I told you to assist Dr. Do?</font>

858
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:12,825
<font color="yellow">You were frustrated and upset. You didn't want to do that.</font>

859
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:15,495
<font color="yellow">"Should I do this or not?"</font>

860
00:52:15,895 --> 00:52:17,495
<font color="yellow">That was all you thought about.</font>

861
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:22,225
<font color="yellow">Listen. This isn't your playground.</font>

862
00:52:22,525 --> 00:52:26,225
<font color="yellow">Whether you two fight or whatever, leave it outside.</font>

863
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:27,355
<font color="yellow">Once you entered this room,</font>

864
00:52:27,655 --> 00:52:30,555
<font color="yellow">you should've cleared your mind and focused on the patient.</font>

865
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:32,995
<font color="yellow">How dare you throw a tantrum...</font>

866
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,655
<font color="yellow">when you started an operation without clear mind?</font>

867
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:39,625
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can do your best when you're preoccupied?</font>

868
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:45,625
<font color="yellow">You don't deserve to be in here and even to breathe.</font>

869
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:46,755
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

870
00:53:00,895 --> 00:53:02,255
<font color="yellow">I stopped the bleeding.</font>

871
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:04,225
<font color="yellow">I'll conduct a segmental resection,</font>

872
00:53:04,425 --> 00:53:06,355
<font color="yellow">and then end-to-end anastomosis.</font>

873
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:09,025
<font color="yellow">I'll close it up as soon as possible and move on to the spine.</font>

874
00:53:09,025 --> 00:53:10,055
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

875
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,425
<font color="yellow">Babcock Forceps.</font>

876
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:28,655
<font color="yellow">I hope he'll get through this.</font>

877
00:53:29,695 --> 00:53:32,255
<font color="yellow">- Let me ask you something. - What is it?</font>

878
00:53:32,255 --> 00:53:34,825
<font color="yellow">You could've ordered the targeted temperature management.</font>

879
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:36,425
<font color="yellow">Why did you try to convince me?</font>

880
00:53:37,595 --> 00:53:40,155
<font color="yellow">It's because he's your patient.</font>

881
00:53:40,155 --> 00:53:42,755
<font color="yellow">No. I think there's some other reason.</font>

882
00:53:42,755 --> 00:53:44,155
<font color="yellow">What is it? Tell me.</font>

883
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:46,225
<font color="yellow">There's no other reason.</font>

884
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:48,355
<font color="yellow">Why would there be?</font>

885
00:53:50,495 --> 00:53:53,395
<font color="yellow">- I'll go drink some water. - Why all of a sudden?</font>

886
00:53:54,525 --> 00:53:56,955
<font color="yellow">She seems so suspicious.</font>

891

930
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:32,825
<font color="yellow">Walk slowly.</font>

931
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:38,425
<font color="yellow">You might get a cut on your neck.</font>

932
00:57:39,095 --> 00:57:40,125
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

933
00:57:41,195 --> 00:57:42,425

00:57:52,855 --> 00:57:55,725
<font color="yellow">Who are you and why are you doing this in the operating room?</font>

938
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:57,695
<font color="yellow">Who is the leader?</font>

00:58:00,795 --> 00:58:03,595
<font color="yellow">Who gives orders in this operating room?</font>

940
00:58:06,225 --> 00:58:07,255
<font color="yellow">That's me.</font>

941
00:58:13,325 --> 00:58:14,355
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

942
00:58:17,425 --> 00:58:18,795

<font color="yellow">I don't want to give up on the operation.</font>

949
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:52,925
<font color="yellow">Again, in the worst-case scenario, you might get disqualified.</font>

950
00:58:52,925 --> 00:58:54,755
<font color="yellow">Just let them deal with me.</font>

951
00:58:54,825 --> 00:58:57,655

954
00:59:03,995 --> 00:59:05,625
<font color="yellow">In fancier words,</font>

955
