<font color="yellow">that you will take it eventually?</font>

158
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,750
<font color="yellow">Why would I not take it?</font>

159
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,610
<font color="yellow">It is a great offer.</font>

160
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,510
<font color="yellow">I should get going.</font>

161
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,610
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

162
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,140
<font color="yellow">- We are ready for thoracentesis. - Okay.</font>

163
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,610
<font color="yellow">Let's begin.</font>

164
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,140
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

165
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,380
<font color="yellow">Bring this to the lab.</font>

166
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master Kim.</font>

167
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,110
<font color="yellow">Tell me if it exceeds 1L.</font>

168
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,810
<font color="yellow">I will need to check his condition.</font>

169
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,040
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

170
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,080
<font color="yellow">It's done. Thank you.</font>

171
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,480
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you want to tell me something?</font>

172
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,840
<font color="yellow">Well, it's...</font>

173
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,380
<font color="yellow">Do it later if it is not about a patient.</font>

174
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,140
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim. - Yes?</font>

175
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,480
<font color="yellow">There you are.</font>

176
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,340
<font color="yellow">This is an emergency.</font>

177
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,680
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

178
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,580
<font color="yellow">President Do suggested a great offer to Dr. Kang.</font>

179
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,910
<font color="yellow">A 15-percent increase in salary...</font>

180
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,840
<font color="yellow">and the research fund of 100,000 dollars every year.</font>

181
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,180
<font color="yellow">He tried to kick Dr. Yoon out with her pay cut down,</font>

182
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,940
<font color="yellow">and now he tries to appease Dr. Kang with a pay raise.</font>

183
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,610
<font color="yellow">The whole scenario is a part of his plan...</font>

184
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,750
<font color="yellow">to collapse Doldam Hospital.</font>

185
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,440
<font color="yellow">Don't you think?</font>

186
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,580
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

187
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,680
<font color="yellow">To collapse Doldam Hospital?</font>

188
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,680
<font color="yellow">What's that noise? It's loud.</font>

189
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,440
<font color="yellow">Hey, can't you hear me?</font>

190
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
<font color="yellow">Don't you see I'm trying to sleep?</font>

191
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,080
<font color="yellow">I didn't see that. Were you sleeping?</font>

192
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,880
<font color="yellow">I heard you met President Do.</font>

193
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,580
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that already?</font>

194
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,210
<font color="yellow">A 15-percent increase in salary...</font>

195
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,440
<font color="yellow">and the research fund of 100,000 dollars every year?</font>

196
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,740
<font color="yellow">So, will you take it?</font>

197
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,440
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about it.</font>

198
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,310
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that you actually want to take it?</font>

199
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,040
<font color="yellow">If you were me, wouldn't you even consider it?</font>

200
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,040
<font color="yellow">No, I wouldn't.</font>

201
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,440
<font color="yellow">Why would he offer such a big money...</font>

202
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,580
<font color="yellow">to a fellow surgeon like you?</font>

203
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,740
<font color="yellow">It means he wants something from you.</font>

204
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,580
<font color="yellow">And you will have to do anything to meet his expectation.</font>

205
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,580
<font color="yellow">You will be used and manipulated by him.</font>

206
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,140
<font color="yellow">Eventually, it will destroy your life and conscience.</font>

207
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,410
<font color="yellow">Don't be so dramatic about it.</font>

208
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
<font color="yellow">I just got a good offer,</font>

209
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,410
<font color="yellow">and you are destroying my life and conscience already.</font>

210
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,310
<font color="yellow">There is no such thing as a free lunch.</font>

211
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,110
<font color="yellow">Based on my own experiences,</font>

212
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,880
<font color="yellow">that's how life is.</font>

213
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,480
<font color="yellow">Why are you so worried?</font>

214
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,740
<font color="yellow">If he wants to go, he'll go. If he doesn't, he won't.</font>

215
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,780
<font color="yellow">His life may get ruined once he does that because of money.</font>

216
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,610
<font color="yellow">Do you like him that much?</font>

217
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,140
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

218
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,240
<font color="yellow">Why do you say that?</font>

219
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,040
<font color="yellow">Aren't you two dating?</font>

220
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,680
<font color="yellow">Dating? Who?</font>

221
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,810
<font color="yellow">Me? With him?</font>

222
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,710
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

223
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,610
<font color="yellow">Who said that? Did Dong Joo say that?</font>

224
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,010
<font color="yellow">No, it looked like that.</font>

225
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,640
<font color="yellow">Then I guess what you saw is wrong.</font>

226
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,240
<font color="yellow">No, never.</font>

227
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,010
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Why would I date him?</font>

228
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,810
<font color="yellow">Yes, President Yeo.</font>

229
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,680
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

230
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,610
<font color="yellow">- Who is that? - Hey, Dr. Kang.</font>

231
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,580
<font color="yellow">I was about to call you.</font>

232
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,440
<font color="yellow">We have a patient with abdominal pain.</font>

233
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,240
<font color="yellow">Is Dr. Jung gone?</font>

234
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,140
<font color="yellow">It's his lunchtime. Should I call him?</font>

235
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
<font color="yellow">No, I got this.</font>

236
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,740
<font color="yellow">How may I help you?</font>

237
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,110
<font color="yellow">It's not me. It's my friend.</font>

238
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,540
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

239
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,780
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

240
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,180
<font color="yellow">Can we talk to a different doctor?</font>

241
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,180
<font color="yellow">I would prefer to see the doctor who stitched up my knee before.</font>

242
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,410
<font color="yellow">It's lunch time. I'm the only one available.</font>

243
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,310
<font color="yellow">- Let me take a look. - Okay.</font>

244
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,380
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Eom. - Yes.</font>

245
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,980
<font color="yellow">Sir, where do you have pain?</font>

246
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,480
<font color="yellow">His stomach.</font>

247
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,940
<font color="yellow">He kept on saying his stomach hurt since yesterday.</font>

248
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,240
<font color="yellow">Sir, can you lie down?</font>

249
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,040
<font color="yellow">Turn over slowly.</font>

250
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,480
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look.</font>

251
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,510
<font color="yellow">How are his vitals?</font>

252
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,940
<font color="yellow">It's 100 over 70, 130 beats per minute.</font>

253
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,310
<font color="yellow">- Check for his temperature. - Yes.</font>

254
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,880
<font color="yellow">Sir, I will feel your stomach now.</font>

255
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,740
<font color="yellow">His tenderness is very severe.</font>

256
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,040
<font color="yellow">His temperature is 39.6°C.</font>

257
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,680
<font color="yellow">- Bring FAST. - Okay.</font>

258
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,680
<font color="yellow">Does this hurt?</font>

259
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,980
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

260
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,810
<font color="yellow">How did you get hurt?</font>

261
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,180
<font color="yellow">When did you get hurt?</font>

262
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,180
<font color="yellow">Doctor, can you give him some painkillers first?</font>

263
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,280
<font color="yellow">Did you hit him?</font>

264
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,010
<font color="yellow">- No. - Dr. Kang.</font>

265
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,680
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

266
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,140
<font color="yellow">I see some fluid in there.</font>

267
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,140
<font color="yellow">Could it be trauma hemoperitoneum?</font>

268
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,580
<font color="yellow">Set up IV lines and hydrate him with two liters.</font>

269
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,310
<font color="yellow">Mix 50ml of Demerol and 2 ampoules of denogan...</font>

270
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,940
<font color="yellow">with 100ml of normal saline.</font>

271
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,040
<font color="yellow">We'll keep him hydrated and start with CT scans.</font>

272
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,310
<font color="yellow">- Also, check his OP Lab. - Okay.</font>

273
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,610
<font color="yellow">Sir, we'll give you some painkillers...</font>

274
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,710
<font color="yellow">and proceed with the CT scan.</font>

275
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,040
<font color="yellow">Stay here, okay?</font>

276
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,040
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

277
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,110
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Oh. - Yes?</font>

278
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,880
<font color="yellow">Somethings is odd about them. What should I do?</font>

279
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,510
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, odd?</font>

280
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,880
<font color="yellow">That patient with abdominal pain...</font>

281
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,810
<font color="yellow">looks like he's been beaten badly.</font>

282
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,140
<font color="yellow">The patient is very conscious about the other guy.</font>

283
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,110
<font color="yellow">I don't think I should leave them together.</font>

284
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,340
<font color="yellow">Young Gyun.</font>

285
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,010
<font color="yellow">- What do we do? - Don't worry.</font>

286
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,880
<font color="yellow">We'll leave after you get that painkiller.</font>

287
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

288
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,180
<font color="yellow">A lawsuit?</font>

289
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,080
<font color="yellow">Against who? Me?</font>

290
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,980
<font color="yellow">Are you the one who collected the blood sample...</font>

291
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,040
<font color="yellow">of the drunk driver yesterday?</font>

292
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,640
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

293
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,910
<font color="yellow">Did you know you have offended the law...</font>

294
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,280
<font color="yellow">by injuring him...</font>

295
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,510
<font color="yellow">with an unconsented...</font>

296
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,240
<font color="yellow">blood collection?</font>

297
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,540
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? I was consented.</font>

298
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,240
<font color="yellow">- Were you? - Yes.</font>

299
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,510
<font color="yellow">She got his consent.</font>

300
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,740
<font color="yellow">Do you have a consent form?</font>

301
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,080
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a situation where I could fill out a form,</font>

302
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,010
<font color="yellow">but he gave me the consent with his own words.</font>

303
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,680
<font color="yellow">He kept insisting on a blood test instead of breathing into a machine.</font>

304
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,840
<font color="yellow">He has no recollection of giving such a consent.</font>

305
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

306
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,610
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me, we need to talk. - Hey.</font>

307
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,740
<font color="yellow">I'm about to die.</font>

308
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,640
<font color="yellow">- Help me. - Just hang in there.</font>

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,140
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

310
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,680
<font color="yellow">You said it yourself.</font>

311
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,010
<font color="yellow">You wanted a blood test for your blood alcohol level.</font>

312
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,640
<font color="yellow">That's why I took your blood sample. What are you trying to do?</font>

313
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,110
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

314
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,410
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

315
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,880
<font color="yellow">She's the girl who drew my blood.</font>

316
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,450
<font color="yellow">I see. It's you.</font>

317
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,280
<font color="yellow">You are the one who drew out blood from my precious son.</font>

318
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,910
<font color="yellow">I heard you made a claim for damages.</font>

319
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,980
<font color="yellow">You can talk to my lawyer about that.</font>

320
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,340
<font color="yellow">He's our representative.</font>

321
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,510
<font color="yellow">Son, I brought some soup.</font>

322
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,610
<font color="yellow">- You can have one, too. - Thank you.</font>

323
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,980
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Did you ask for a lot of meat?</font>

324
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,140
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's me, your mom.</font>

325
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,980
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

326
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,380
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

327
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,810
<font color="yellow">Look at you two.</font>

328
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
<font color="yellow">People have died.</font>

329
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,980
<font color="yellow">A man died on the site and another died in the emergency room.</font>

330
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,580
<font color="yellow">There are eight people seriously and lightly injured.</font>

331
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,510
<font color="yellow">And two road workers even lost their legs!</font>

332
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,450
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

333
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,310
<font color="yellow">How can you eat in such a situation?</font>

334
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,210
<font color="yellow">How can you play games?</font>

335
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,480
<font color="yellow">You are unbelievable.</font>

336
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,480
<font color="yellow">It's not like you paid...</font>

337
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,140
<font color="yellow">for these soups.</font>

338
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,740
<font color="yellow">Who are you to say anything about my son having a meal?</font>

339
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,880
<font color="yellow">His blood-alcohol level was at 0.18 percent.</font>

340
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,210
<font color="yellow">That's like committing a suicide, driving in that condition.</font>

341
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,010
<font color="yellow">We'll take care of the law.</font>

342
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,740
<font color="yellow">We will make compensations with the people affected.</font>

343
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,080
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

344
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,280
<font color="yellow">How dare a mere doctor like you come up to me...</font>

345
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,810
<font color="yellow">and try to teach me?</font>

346
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,680
<font color="yellow">Are you a judge or something?</font>

347
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,140
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel...</font>

348
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,810
<font color="yellow">any guilt or blame as a human being?</font>

349
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,810
<font color="yellow">A young guy like him can have a drink from time to time,</font>

350
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,540
<font color="yellow">and he might want to drive!</font>

351
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,610
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear that people have died?</font>

352
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,980
<font color="yellow">This hospital is awful.</font>

353
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,310
<font color="yellow">- We should get discharged. - Mom.</font>

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,310
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

355
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,140
<font color="yellow">Police will come after me the moment I walk out.</font>

356
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,180
<font color="yellow">Our lawyer told us...</font>

357
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,510
<font color="yellow">to stay here for a while.</font>

358
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,980
<font color="yellow">This isn't the only hospital around.</font>

359
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,450
<font color="yellow">You can eat.</font>

360
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,950
<font color="yellow">- I'll take care of this. - Okay.</font>

361
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,780
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Hong, it's me.</font>

362
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,110
<font color="yellow">Some weird doctor came and began to tell us what to do.</font>

363
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,410
<font color="yellow">She's giving me a headache.</font>

364
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,510
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

365
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,180
<font color="yellow">It's not hemoperitoneum. It's pan-peritonitis.</font>

366
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,980
<font color="yellow">It's bowel perforation.</font>

367
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,240
<font color="yellow">I can see diverticulum,</font>

368
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,140
<font color="yellow">but I don't think it's diverticulitis perforation.</font>

369
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,280
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

370
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,510
<font color="yellow">it's bowel perforation caused by a trauma.</font>

371
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,080
<font color="yellow">I saw a bruise on his stomach which looked like a result of a beating.</font>

372
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,810
<font color="yellow">I think that's more likely.</font>

373
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,810
<font color="yellow">He has sepsis, so he needs an operation now.</font>

374
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,980
<font color="yellow">I will do it.</font>

375
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,180
<font color="yellow">I'll tell Dr. Do...</font>

376
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,810
<font color="yellow">to assist you.</font>

377
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,680
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh.</font>

378
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,510
<font color="yellow">- Will you call Dr. Do? - Yes.</font>

379
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,630
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to ask me anything?</font>

380
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,040
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

381
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,450
<font color="yellow">I met President Do today.</font>

382
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,950
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd know already.</font>

383
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,810
<font color="yellow">Does my knowing change anything?</font>

384
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,180
<font color="yellow">But still.</font>

385
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,740
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd say something.</font>

386
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,880
<font color="yellow">It's your life.</font>

387
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,680
<font color="yellow">The decision is yours, too.</font>

388
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,680
<font color="yellow">Our hospital...</font>

389
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,980
<font color="yellow">can't give you what he offered.</font>

390
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,680
<font color="yellow">You can choose to go if you'd like.</font>

391
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,010
<font color="yellow">I thought you wanted me to become a doctor that's needed.</font>

392
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
<font color="yellow">Isn't that what you said?</font>

393
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,980
<font color="yellow">How can you...</font>

394
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,040
<font color="yellow">ask me to follow terms and conditions?</font>

395
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,310
<font color="yellow">I meant that I can't stop you if you wanted those.</font>

396
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,680
<font color="yellow">Even if I persuade you to stay here with this and that,</font>

397
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
<font color="yellow">you will...</font>

398
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,040
<font color="yellow">always wonder what lied in the road you haven't taken.</font>

399
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,780
<font color="yellow">Why did you talk to him like that?</font>

400
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,580
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - I know you don't want to...</font>

401
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,040
<font color="yellow">let Dr. Kang go.</font>

402
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,140
<font color="yellow">You could have told him that he's the kind of doctor we need.</font>

403
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,480
<font color="yellow">That's probably what he wanted to hear.</font>

404
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,840
<font color="yellow">He's the one who has to make the decisions in his life.</font>

405
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,480
<font color="yellow">I can't make him to do anything...</font>

406
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,540
<font color="yellow">against his own will.</font>

407
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,680
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that he decided to stay here.</font>

408
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,680
<font color="yellow">Do you think he'll be happy?</font>

409
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,880
<font color="yellow">Unless he finds the reason...</font>

410
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,880
<font color="yellow">for him to stay here,</font>

411
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,180
<font color="yellow">he won't be happy here no matter what.</font>

412
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,680
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang respects you.</font>

413
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,910
<font color="yellow">That's not true at all.</font>

414
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,140
<font color="yellow">He just wants to learn how to operate like me.</font>

415
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,710
<font color="yellow">That's about it for him now.</font>

416
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,440
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

417
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,110
<font color="yellow">- You know what? - What?</font>

418
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,580
<font color="yellow">That you're a very twisted man.</font>

419
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,810
<font color="yellow">- Am I twisted? - Yes, Master Kim.</font>

420
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,080
<font color="yellow">I don't understand her. Am I in the wrong one here?</font>

421
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
<font color="yellow">Every time he opens his mouth, he tries to lecture someone.</font>

422
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,210
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired of...</font>

423
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,840
<font color="yellow">How can someone be so stubborn?</font>

424
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,480
<font color="yellow">I don't understand how anyone can be so shameless.</font>

425
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,440
<font color="yellow">There isn't a person in the world who will like him...</font>

426
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,910
<font color="yellow">if he never speaks from his heart.</font>

427
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,740
<font color="yellow">Does speaking the truth mean the end of the world to him?</font>

428
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,980
<font color="yellow">She's not even slightly remorseful for hurting other people.</font>

429
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,840
<font color="yellow">She even brought her son hangover soup.</font>

430
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,980
<font color="yellow">I will never understand such irrational people.</font>

431
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,780
<font color="yellow">I've been working by his side long enough to understand,</font>

432
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,780
<font color="yellow">but how will a fresh face like Dr. Kang...</font>

433
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,940
<font color="yellow">be able to understand Master Kim's true intentions?</font>

434
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,510
<font color="yellow">- Don't you think so? - That's exactly my point.</font>

435
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,140
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

436
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,080
<font color="yellow">He told Dr. Kang that he could leave here any time...</font>

437
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,240
<font color="yellow">for places with better conditions and that he will not stop him.</font>

438
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,380
<font color="yellow">What? Are you serious? No way.</font>

439
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,910
<font color="yellow">That's exactly my point.</font>

440
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,140
<font color="yellow">What's going on with you, Dr. Yoon?</font>

441
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,840
<font color="yellow">I just got sued by a DUI assailant.</font>

442
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,880
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

443
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,310
<font color="yellow">Is he crazy?</font>

444
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,810
<font color="yellow">What is this world coming to?</font>

445
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,910
<font color="yellow">That's exactly my point, Ms. Oh.</font>

446
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,810
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

447
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,880
<font color="yellow">May I help you?</font>

448
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
<font color="yellow">A soldier went AWOL from his base.</font>

449
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,980
<font color="yellow">We're on a search for him at the moment.</font>

450
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,510
<font color="yellow">He ran away from his base?</font>

451
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,110
<font color="yellow">Can I look around the hospital?</font>

452
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,810
<font color="yellow">Please be quick and don't disturb the patients.</font>

453
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,410
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

454
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,410
<font color="yellow">Slowly.</font>

455
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,880
<font color="yellow">I'll take you to the operating room now.</font>

456
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,610
<font color="yellow">Ms. Eom, have you seen the patient on that bed?</font>

457
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,780
<font color="yellow">Why? Is he not there?</font>

458
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,040
<font color="yellow">No. His friend is missing, too.</font>

459
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,810
<font color="yellow">What? That's strange.</font>

460
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

461
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,810
<font color="yellow">It's the young male patient with pan-peritonitis.</font>

462
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,680
<font color="yellow">I was going to move him to the operating room, but he went missing.</font>

463
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,240
<font color="yellow">He's missing?</font>

464
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,110
<font color="yellow">Can you describe what that patient looks like?</font>

465
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,880
<font color="yellow">How old did he look? What was he wearing?</font>

466
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,510
<font color="yellow">He looked in his early 20s.</font>

467
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,110
<font color="yellow">Is this him?</font>

468
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

469
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,940
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Yes, Sir.</font>

470
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,810
<font color="yellow">What's going on, Ms. Oh?</font>

471
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,440
<font color="yellow">He's a run-away soldier.</font>

472
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,580
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

473
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,140
<font color="yellow">- A run-away soldier? - Yes.</font>

474
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,540
<font color="yellow">The military police in plain clothes are searching the hospital.</font>

475
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,840
<font color="yellow">The two men are nowhere to be found.</font>

476
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,910
<font color="yellow">It's not safe for him to move around.</font>

477
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,940
<font color="yellow">He could die if we don't open him up right now.</font>

478
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,540
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

479
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,810
<font color="yellow">Joo Hyuk. Hang in there, Joo Hyuk.</font>

480
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,040
<font color="yellow">Young Gyun. I...</font>

481
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,840
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to make it.</font>

482
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,210
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

483
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,940
<font color="yellow">in pain.</font>

484
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,410
<font color="yellow">Wake up. Wake up, Joo Hyuk.</font>

485
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,980
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

486
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,910
<font color="yellow">Are you coming out of Doldam Hospital?</font>

487
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,010
<font color="yellow">He shouldn't be going anywhere with the condition he's in.</font>

488
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,380
<font color="yellow">- Get him on my back. - No.</font>

489
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,240
<font color="yellow">We can't go back to that hospital.</font>

490
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,780
<font color="yellow">If my friend goes back there, they'll take him away.</font>

491
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,710
<font color="yellow">Your friend could die if you don't go back right now.</font>

492
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,580
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang. I just got a call from Dr. Nam.</font>

493
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,580
<font color="yellow">He's on his way to the ER with that run-away soldier.</font>

494
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,440
<font color="yellow">Aren't you coming?</font>

495
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,910
<font color="yellow">Can you hear me, Sir?</font>

496
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,580
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

497
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,840
<font color="yellow">- What happened? - He lost consciousness out there.</font>

498
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,710
<font color="yellow">- How are his vitals? - It's 80 over 40. This isn't good.</font>

499
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,440
<font color="yellow">His body temperature is 39.8°C.</font>

500
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,110
<font color="yellow">How could you take him with you with the condition he's in?</font>

501
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,740
<font color="yellow">Did you get his consent?</font>

502
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,980
<font color="yellow">I got it from himself when he still had consciousness.</font>

503
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,210
<font color="yellow">Okay. Dr. Nam.</font>

504
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,740
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back after I get changed.</font>

505
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,410
<font color="yellow">Let's move this patient to the operating room.</font>

506
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,240
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

507
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,180
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

508
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,840
<font color="yellow">It's him, Private Park Joo Hyuk. Call it in.</font>

509
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,140
<font color="yellow">Private Park Joo Hyuk.</font>

510
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
<font color="yellow">Park Joo Hyuk.</font>

511
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,140
<font color="yellow">You have the right to remain silent,</font>

512
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,210
<font color="yellow">and anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.</font>

513
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,340
<font color="yellow">You have the right to consult an attorney. Got it?</font>

514
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

515
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,940
<font color="yellow">Can't you see he's unconscious?</font>

516
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,110
<font color="yellow">By principle, we have to read AWOL soldiers their Miranda rights.</font>

517
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,180
<font color="yellow">As of this moment, Private Park is under our control.</font>

518
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,240
<font color="yellow">You can't do that.</font>

519
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,080
<font color="yellow">He's a sepsis patient. He could lose his life any minute.</font>

520
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,740
<font color="yellow">I'll contact the army hospital to transfer him from here.</font>

521
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,440
<font color="yellow">Can't you see his condition?</font>

522
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,340
<font color="yellow">He can't afford to lose more time.</font>

523
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,640
<font color="yellow">If that's the case, you should move him to the operating room right now.</font>

524
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,310
<font color="yellow">- What's the hold up? - Master Kim.</font>

525
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,480
<font color="yellow">Are you the person in charge of this hospital?</font>

526
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,210
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't say I'm in charge of the entire hospital,</font>

527
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,180
<font color="yellow">but I am responsible for this operation.</font>

528
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
<font color="yellow">He's a run-away soldier.</font>

529
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,240
<font color="yellow">I'd like to make a request for extradition.</font>

530
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,910
<font color="yellow">You can do that after we operate on him.</font>

531
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,040
<font color="yellow">If you keep this up,</font>

532
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,080
<font color="yellow">you'll be charged with obstruction of justice.</font>

533
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,010
<font color="yellow">Once the doctor decides that it can't be done,</font>

534
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,810
<font color="yellow">you're not allowed to transfer the patient.</font>

535
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you're aware of interference with medical treatment.</font>

536
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,610
<font color="yellow">- Doctor. - Yes?</font>

537
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,340
<font color="yellow">What are you still doing there?</font>

538
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,840
<font color="yellow">Move him to the operating room.</font>

539
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,410
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's move him.</font>

540
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,340
<font color="yellow">Officer.</font>

541
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,810
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

542
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,440
<font color="yellow">He's almost as good as dead.</font>

543
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,540
<font color="yellow">He's not going to run out of the operating room now.</font>

544
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,610
<font color="yellow">Do you have the contacts of your friend's parents?</font>

545
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,840
<font color="yellow">- I do. - Notify them right away.</font>

546
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,740
<font color="yellow">Tell them that they should come to the hospital as soon as possible.</font>

547
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,810
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

548
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,210
<font color="yellow">Set up central lines with ODW...</font>

549
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,410
<font color="yellow">mixed with 32ml of norepinephrine.</font>

550
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,580
<font color="yellow">- Execute a drop of 10cc per hour. - Yes, Doctor.</font>

551
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,180
<font color="yellow">What condition is he in?</font>

552
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,810
<font color="yellow">It's 70 over 40. He's barely holding on.</font>

553
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,010
<font color="yellow">- Shall we start? - Okay.</font>

554
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

555
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,140
<font color="yellow">Master Kim told me to record this operation.</font>

556
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,710
<font color="yellow">Let's begin, Dr. Kang.</font>

557
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,610
<font color="yellow">Scalpel.</font>

558
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,680
<font color="yellow">I'll report back to you right away.</font>

559
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,010
<font color="yellow">The situation is complicated.</font>

560
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,440
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

561
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,880
<font color="yellow">They seem pretty busy.</font>

562
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,040
<font color="yellow">- I'll take care of it discreetly. - It's a run-away solider...</font>

563
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,940
<font color="yellow">being operated in a general hospital.</font>

564
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,340
<font color="yellow">No wonder they're busy.</font>

565
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,910
<font color="yellow">Whenever some internal violence happens in the military,</font>

566
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,210
<font color="yellow">at least one of the high personnel ends up getting fired.</font>

567
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,340
<font color="yellow">Have you served in the military? Army? Navy? Or the air force?</font>

568
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,040
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

569
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,810
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

570
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,280
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious.</font>

571
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,880
<font color="yellow">Which unit were you in?</font>

572
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,180
<font color="yellow">Well, it's a...</font>

573
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,280
<font color="yellow">- A... - The army?</font>

574
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,910
<font color="yellow">- I see. - Yes.</font>

575
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,780
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon, you're here.</font>

576
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,340
<font color="yellow">May I see you?</font>

577
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,040
<font color="yellow">What could Dr. Song want with me?</font>

578
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,440
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

579
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,380
<font color="yellow">Did you want...</font>

580
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,810
<font color="yellow">me?</font>

581
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,180
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon.</font>

582
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,740
<font color="yellow">Did you threaten a patient today?</font>

583
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,810
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

584
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,510
<font color="yellow">Threaten?</font>

585
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,440
<font color="yellow">Why did you run into their room...</font>

586
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,340
<font color="yellow">and say unnecessary things like...</font>

587
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,380
<font color="yellow">that they should feel sorry,</font>

588
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,910
<font color="yellow">and that many people died because of him?</font>

589
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,840
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't display...</font>

590
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,310
<font color="yellow">your feeble heart of justice in public, Dr. Yoon.</font>

591
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,510
<font color="yellow">A doctor...</font>

592
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,210
<font color="yellow">should only do what a doctor should.</font>

593
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,940
<font color="yellow">Apologize to them. Immediately.</font>

594
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,940
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

595
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,110
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear?</font>

596
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,440
<font color="yellow">Apologize to them.</font>

597
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,010
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

598
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,880
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

599
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

600
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,610
<font color="yellow">I was overemotional.</font>

601
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,940
<font color="yellow">I did run to them...</font>

602
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,880
<font color="yellow">and tell them about the people he hurt.</font>

603
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
<font color="yellow">I know that I shouldn't have gone that far.</font>

604
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,280
<font color="yellow">However, I won't apologize.</font>

605
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon!</font>

606
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,240
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable.</font>

607
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,280
<font color="yellow">They can...</font>

608
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,210
<font color="yellow">walk out of here with a few pain relief patches right now,</font>

609
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,980
<font color="yellow">and they'll be totally fine.</font>

610
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,810
<font color="yellow">Their car was such an expensive car,</font>

611
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,810
<font color="yellow">and six airbags went off.</font>

612
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,310
<font color="yellow">They are not hurt at all.</font>

613
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,140
<font color="yellow">They are sitting here because they don't want to get arrested.</font>

614
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,610
<font color="yellow">Hey, Miss. Are you finished?</font>

615
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,440
<font color="yellow">I'm not a Miss.</font>

616
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,780
<font color="yellow">I'm Dr. Yoon Seo Jung.</font>

617
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,940
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

618
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,880
<font color="yellow">Your hospital is a mess, Dr. Song.</font>

619
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,010
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

620
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,010
<font color="yellow">I haven't been here for long.</font>

621
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,540
<font color="yellow">Where are your manners?</font>

622
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,680
<font color="yellow">Apologize immediately.</font>

623
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,180
<font color="yellow">Apologize on everything including what you just said.</font>

624
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,940
<font color="yellow">Like I said, I won't.</font>

625
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,510
<font color="yellow">Are you going against the words of the head surgeon?</font>

626
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,210
<font color="yellow">Please only give me orders which I can comply with, Sir.</font>

627
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,880
<font color="yellow">If you are finished,</font>

628
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,240
<font color="yellow">I'll be leaving.</font>

629
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,440
<font color="yellow">Look at her.</font>

630
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,610
<font color="yellow">Hey, Dr. Yoon!</font>

631
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,480
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

632
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,510
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon.</font>

633
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,180
<font color="yellow">What will you make of me if you leave like this?</font>

634
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,180
<font color="yellow">She is...</font>

635
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,110
<font color="yellow">the wife of the provincial assembly, Han Gi Jun,</font>

636
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,640
<font color="yellow">who's also a close friend of the governor.</font>

637
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,810
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

638
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,680
<font color="yellow">What does he have to do with me...</font>

639
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,140
<font color="yellow">let alone his wife?</font>

640
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,140
<font color="yellow">You don't know the real world.</font>

641
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,780
<font color="yellow">What I mean is she is someone...</font>

642
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,380
<font color="yellow">you should calm by apologizing...</font>

643
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,580
<font color="yellow">regardless of your opinion about her.</font>

644
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,540
<font color="yellow">Why would I do that?</font>

645
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,380
<font color="yellow">I'm not a politician or a public worker.</font>

646
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,380
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I'm a doctor.</font>

647
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,910
<font color="yellow">You said I just need to do what a doctor does.</font>

648
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,410
<font color="yellow">Then why would I need to apologize to someone like her?</font>

649
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,640
<font color="yellow">That's the order of this world.</font>

650
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,310
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon!</font>

651
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,940
<font color="yellow">Let's go and apologize. It'll make things so much easier.</font>

652
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,280
<font color="yellow">I will talk to her...</font>

653
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,110
<font color="yellow">into dropping the charges against you.</font>

654
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,540
<font color="yellow">Forget about it and tell her to sue me.</font>

655
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,610
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

656
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,140
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

657
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,640
<font color="yellow">Hey! Dr. Yoon!</font>

658
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,610
<font color="yellow">Turn in a written apology and explanation by tomorrow!</font>

659
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,080
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

660
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,280
<font color="yellow">I'll get him.</font>

661
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,280
<font color="yellow">- Please come with me. - To where?</font>

662
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,380
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

663
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,680
<font color="yellow">Get up and sit here.</font>

664
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,010
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

665
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,110
<font color="yellow">I already got checked up.</font>

666
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,110
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

667
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,350
<font color="yellow">(Intensive Care Unit)</font>

668
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,740
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - Look at them.</font>

669
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,140
<font color="yellow">Look at what you've done.</font>

670
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,080
<font color="yellow">Did you say you'll compensate with money?</font>

671
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,310
<font color="yellow">Do you think their lives are compensable with money?</font>

672
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,210
<font color="yellow">Look at them!</font>

673
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,980
<font color="yellow">You'll only realize what you've done only after you see this.</font>

674
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,380
<font color="yellow">Money is your talent.</font>

675
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,380
<font color="yellow">Your rich mother is your supporter.</font>

676
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,350
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

677
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,350
<font color="yellow">That's great, but...</font>

678
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,510
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you at least learn...</font>

679
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,580
<font color="yellow">what conscience is?</font>

680
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,410
<font color="yellow">What are you doing over there?</font>

681
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,180
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

682
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,310
<font color="yellow">My...</font>

683
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,240
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

684
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,350
<font color="yellow">- Did you just hit me? - Yes, I did.</font>

685
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,410
<font color="yellow">What will you do? Press charges against me?</font>

686
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,640
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

687
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,940
<font color="yellow">How dare you make my son cry?</font>

688
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,210
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are?</font>

689
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,910
<font color="yellow">Why are you so shameless?</font>

690
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,240
<font color="yellow">- Don't you know what you've done? - What did you say?</font>

691
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,240
<font color="yellow">You feel no guilt and you have no shame.</font>

692
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,680
<font color="yellow">Since when did the world...</font>

693
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,880
<font color="yellow">let people like you get powerful?</font>

694
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,810
<font color="yellow">- How dare you say... - Forget about it.</font>

695
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,780
<font color="yellow">I will file a counter-charge of your assault.</font>

696
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,210
<font color="yellow">There will be...</font>

697
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,540
<font color="yellow">no settlement or compromise whatsoever.</font>

698
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,110
<font color="yellow">Who does she think she is?</font>

699
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,440
<font color="yellow">My goodness. She's unbelievable.</font>

700
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,110
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

701
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,480
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

702
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,580
<font color="yellow">Who on earth is she?</font>

703
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:56,040
<font color="yellow">The inflammation is only within the perforation site.</font>

704
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,180
<font color="yellow">It's not in the diverticulum, is it?</font>

705
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,080
<font color="yellow">Definitely not.</font>

706
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,410
<font color="yellow">It's definitely caused by a trauma.</font>

707
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,740
<font color="yellow">They must have beat him to death.</font>

708
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,310
<font color="yellow">Do you think he was bullied by the entire infantry?</font>

709
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,080
<font color="yellow">I understand why he would want to run away after this.</font>

710
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,540
<font color="yellow">We'll conduct bowel resection...</font>

711
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,380
<font color="yellow">and functional end-to-end anastomosis.</font>

712
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,980
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang, his blood pressure is dropping.</font>

713
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,310
<font color="yellow">- Increase norepinephrine to 20cc. - Okay.</font>

714
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,940
<font color="yellow">- Is he okay? - I think he's in a septic shock.</font>

715
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,210
<font color="yellow">- We must hurry. - Okay.</font>

716
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
<font color="yellow">GIA, please.</font>

717
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,210
<font color="yellow">Specimen.</font>

718
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,310
<font color="yellow">Saline, please.</font>

719
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
<font color="yellow">Keep it coming.</font>

720
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,140
<font color="yellow">Master Kim.</font>

721
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,280
<font color="yellow">- Master Kim. - Yes?</font>

722
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,040
<font color="yellow">- I've been looking for you. - Why?</font>

723
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,710
<font color="yellow">You have to come to the president's room.</font>

724
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,510
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon got herself into a trouble again.</font>

725
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,210
<font color="yellow">The discipline of this hospital is unacceptable.</font>

726
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,740
<font color="yellow">She ignores the order of a head surgeon.</font>

727
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,710
<font color="yellow">And she crossed the line with her words to a patient...</font>

728
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,540
<font color="yellow">and his guardian.</font>

729
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,310
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

730
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,580
<font color="yellow">This is unacceptable, isn't it?</font>

731
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,980
<font color="yellow">I thought about letting this go,</font>

732
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,140
<font color="yellow">but I get angrier the more I think about this.</font>

733
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,810
<font color="yellow">I won't let this pass.</font>

734
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,710
<font color="yellow">Kneel down and apologize immediately.</font>

735
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,540
<font color="yellow">I must receive her apology.</font>

736
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,980
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

737
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,540
<font color="yellow">She said you should apologize.</font>

738
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,210
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - Apologize to her.</font>

739
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,610
<font color="yellow">Bowing to her at a 45-degree angle would be enough.</font>

740
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,350
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

741
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,540
<font color="yellow">You see...</font>

742
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,210
<font color="yellow">I heard what she said,</font>

743
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,480
<font color="yellow">but I don't think Dr. Yoon did something to deserve to kneel down.</font>

744
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,610
<font color="yellow">However, she kept requesting for an apology.</font>

745
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,980
<font color="yellow">We can't just ignore her request.</font>

746
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,410
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, why don't we...</font>

747
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,380
<font color="yellow">settle this with a 45-degree bow?</font>

748
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,640
<font color="yellow">Wait a second. Master Kim.</font>

749
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,850
<font color="yellow">I forgot. We need you to apologize first.</font>

750
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,850
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - You hit her.</font>

751
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,810
<font color="yellow">Then, you should apologize to her first.</font>

752
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,850
<font color="yellow">even if you won't compensate her.</font>

753
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,140
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding?</font>

754
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,910
<font color="yellow">Do I look like I'm kidding?</font>

755
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,280
<font color="yellow">So is that how you're going to deal with this?</font>

756
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,880
<font color="yellow">All right, then. It seems you don't want to apologize to me.</font>

757
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,210
<font color="yellow">Let's let the law decide.</font>

758
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,140
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to humiliate...</font>

759
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,440
<font color="yellow">both you and that lady doctor.</font>

760
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,940
<font color="yellow">Go ahead, then.</font>

761
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,610
<font color="yellow">I'm an expert at dirty fights.</font>

762
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,110
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You should resolve the situation.</font>

763
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,140
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yoon's apology will resolve all. Why are you making it complicated?</font>

764
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,540
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

765
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,240
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you'll be okay?</font>

766
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,710
<font color="yellow">Rich people have so much...</font>

767
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,210
<font color="yellow">to lose through a dirty fight.</font>

768
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,640
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

769
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,810
<font color="yellow">President Yeo and Manager Jang are...</font>
