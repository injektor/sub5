00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,440
<font color="yellow">Don't disappear
without a word ever again.</font>

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,750
<font color="yellow">Look at you,
messing with your senior again.</font>

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,450
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,350
<font color="yellow">Oh no!</font>

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,740
<font color="yellow">Stop it already!</font>

00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,050
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!
Wake up, sir!</font>

12
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,350
<font color="yellow">- Can you walk?
- Yes.</font>

13
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,550
<font color="yellow">Here, watch your step.</font>

14
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,550
<font color="yellow">Is this 911?</font>

15
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,850
<font color="yellow">We're on Interstate 39,
and there's been an accident here!</font>

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, about six cars!</font>

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,850
<font color="yellow">Just a moment, sir.</font>

18
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,940
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right, sir?
- I didn't do it.</font>

19
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,970
<font color="yellow">I really wasn't speeding!
I was going really slowly!</font>

20
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,050
<font color="yellow">- This isn't my fault!
- Calm down, sir!</font>

21
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,640
<font color="yellow">I got it, so calm down, all right?</font>

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,850
<font color="yellow">Oh... oh no!</font>

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,050
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

24
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,540
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.
Are you injured anywhere?</font>

25
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,850
<font color="yellow">Do you feel any pain near
your hip, neck, or other spots?</font>

26
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,430
<font color="yellow">I'm just a hired designated driver.
I didn't do anything wrong!</font>

27
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,520
<font color="yellow">Can you get up, sir?</font>

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,040
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you, I really
didn't do anything wrong!</font>

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,150
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, sir.
Can you help this man up?</font>

30
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,660
<font color="yellow">Staying on the road is dangerous.
Please go to the side of the road.</font>

31
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,940
<font color="yellow">- All right.
- Please, get up.</font>

32
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,150
<font color="yellow">Let's get you up.</font>

33
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,850
<font color="yellow">Let's check the other cars, too.</font>

34
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,850
<font color="yellow">- I'll look over there.
- I'll inspect the ones in the front.</font>

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,850
<font color="yellow">Oh... you hit me?</font>

36
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,150
<font color="yellow">Did you just hit me?</font>

37
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,250
<font color="yellow">Hey, call the police.
Call the police!</font>

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,040
<font color="yellow">How dare you hit me? Huh?</font>

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,250
<font color="yellow">Do you know who I am?</font>

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,500
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that this is an
emergency patient who needs surgery?</font>

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,540
<font color="yellow">You people always use patients as an
excuse when you're in a tight spot.</font>

42
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,850
<font color="yellow">Hey. I've been a hospital
inspector for 12 years now.</font>

43
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,150
<font color="yellow">I know how you people think better
than I know the palm of my hand!</font>

44
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,150
<font color="yellow">How dare you... Hey, what are
you doing? Call the cops, now!</font>

45
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,850
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

46
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,850
<font color="yellow">This is the police, correct?
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.</font>

47
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,350
<font color="yellow">You have to hurry over here.</font>

48
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,850
<font color="yellow">There's been an assault.</font>

49
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,250
<font color="yellow">Hey, punk.
You're really in for it today.</font>

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,150
<font color="yellow">I won't let you off easy with
just an out-of-court settlement.</font>

51
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,540
<font color="yellow">Doctor! Big trouble, sir!</font>

52
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
<font color="yellow">It's Doctor Kang Dong Joo.</font>

53
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,240
<font color="yellow">He says that there's been an
accident with six cars on the highway.</font>

54
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,650
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

55
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,850
<font color="yellow">What's going on there?</font>

56
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,440
<font color="yellow">There's one patient with a damaged
carotid artery that has already expired</font>

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,250
<font color="yellow">and the four patients who are still
conscious are outside of their cars now.</font>

58
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,350
<font color="yellow">Including those who are unconscious,
we have about 10 injured patients.</font>

59
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,150
<font color="yellow">What about Yoon Seo Jung?
Is she there now?</font>

60
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,450
<font color="yellow">Yes. She's looking for other
injured people, just in case.</font>

61
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,640
<font color="yellow">Nurse Oh. What's the
temperature outside right now?</font>

62
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,090
<font color="yellow">Negative one degree Celsius</font>

63
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,650
<font color="yellow">and it's due to drop two or
three more degrees in an hour.</font>

64
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kang Dong Joo.</font>

65
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,150
<font color="yellow">Children, pregnant women, and those with
excessive bleeding are your priorities.</font>

66
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,240
<font color="yellow">Send the highest-priority people
over on the ambulances first.</font>

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,450
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

68
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,850
<font color="yellow">And make sure to keep
the injured patients warm.</font>

69
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,070
<font color="yellow">Make sure that the unconscious
patients are kept warm, no matter what.</font>

70
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,150
<font color="yellow">You got that?</font>

71
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir!</font>

72
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,040
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything we can
cover people with in your cars?</font>

73
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,750
<font color="yellow">Just a moment!</font>

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,540
<font color="yellow">Allow me to inspect
you for injuries, sir.</font>

75
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,450
<font color="yellow">- Oh my.
- Do you feel any pain anywhere?</font>

76
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,030
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?
What about you, ma'am?</font>

77
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,850
<font color="yellow">Excuse me for a bit.</font>

78
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,850
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's cold.
It's so cold.</font>

79
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,960
<font color="yellow">You punks have been
drinking and driving?</font>

80
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,850
<font color="yellow">Hey, Sis.
Why is it so cold?</font>

81
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,150
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look like you
have any bleeding.</font>

82
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,450
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Don't move,
and just stay in the car for now.</font>

83
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,850
<font color="yellow">Please close the door.
It's so cold.</font>

Please help us!</font>

<font color="yellow">Please stay here for a moment.</font>

96
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,220

97
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,880

able to handle this ourselves.</font>

98
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,240

99
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,850
<font color="yellow">- Hurry and get the supplies out.
- Yes, sir.</font>

100
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,540
<font color="yellow">Please, please!
Save my daughter!</font>

101
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
<font color="yellow">Are you all right, ma'am?</font>

102
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,150

<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

106
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,040
<font color="yellow">Oh no, my Eun Seol!
My poor baby!</font>

107
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,850
<font color="yellow">- Eun Seol!
- How old is your child?</font>

108
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,040
<font color="yellow">How old is your child?</font>

109

<font color="yellow">Four years old!
She's four years old!</font>

110
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,150
<font color="yellow">Where's your car seat?</font>

111
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,540

car without a car seat?</font>

114
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,650
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.
Can you hear me, sir?</font>

115
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,650
<font color="yellow">Mister! Mister!</font>

116
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,640
<font color="yellow">You've hurt your leg quite badly, sir.</font>

117
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,840
<font color="yellow">It needs to be realigned, so I'll get
someone to help you right away.</font>

118
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,250
<font color="yellow">So please wait here just a bit.</font>

119

Just a moment.</font>

more person. One more.</font>

<font color="yellow">Honey, are you all right? Honey!</font>

122
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,640
<font color="yellow">Can one of you go
and get the doctor?</font>

123
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,850
<font color="yellow">My husband has chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease!</font>

124
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,140
<font color="yellow">Please go and tell the doctor!</font>

125
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,850
<font color="yellow">Pul... pulmonary obstructive what?</font>

126
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,450
<font color="yellow">Honey! Oh... oh no!</font>

127
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,140
<font color="yellow">She seems to have internal
hemorrhaging in the abdomen.</font>

128
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,310
<font color="yellow">Please hurry and get her
to Doldam Hospital.</font>

129
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,050
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please come with us too, ma'am.</font>

130
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,550
<font color="yellow">You have to live, Eun Seol!</font>

131
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,950
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

132
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,850
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

133
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,740
<font color="yellow">Can you move your neck?</font>

134
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,550
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

135
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,050
<font color="yellow">Do you have any pain in your hip,
legs, or anywhere else?</font>

136
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,050
<font color="yellow">No, I don't!</font>

137
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,640
<font color="yellow">But... over there.</font>

138
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,350
<font color="yellow">Excuse me! Excuse me!</font>

139
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,850
<font color="yellow">There's a patient up there!</font>

140
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,850
<font color="yellow">He has an open fracture
on his right leg.</font>

141
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,640
<font color="yellow">Please hurry over to him
with something to realign it.</font>

142
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,350
<font color="yellow">Go over there, with a
stretcher and a bandage! Hurry!</font>

143
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,550
<font color="yellow">- Yes, sir!
- Senior!</font>

144
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,240
<font color="yellow">What does that look like to you?</font>

145
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,850
<font color="yellow">It's a person, right?</font>

146
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,450
<font color="yellow">All right, please inhale this
when I count to three.</font>

147
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,550
<font color="yellow">One, two, three!</font>

148
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

149
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,140
<font color="yellow">I'll give you some oxygen now,
so just inhale slowly through your nose.</font>

150
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,740
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

151
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,050
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Back up.</font>

152
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,640
<font color="yellow">Got it.</font>

153
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,050
<font color="yellow">One, two, three!</font>

154
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,740
<font color="yellow">One more time!
One, two, three!</font>

155
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,140
<font color="yellow">One more time!</font>

156
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,350
<font color="yellow">There we go.</font>

157
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,050
<font color="yellow">He has a lower leg crush
injury on both legs.</font>

158
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,450
<font color="yellow">There's a lot of bleeding, too.</font>

159
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,960
<font color="yellow">We'll have to put a
tourniquet on him first.</font>

160
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
<font color="yellow">A tourniquet?</font>

161
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,050
<font color="yellow">- Will this work?
- Yeah, one more.</font>

162
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,350
<font color="yellow">One more?</font>

163
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,850
<font color="yellow">Here's one more.</font>

164
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,850
<font color="yellow">Hydration, please. And get something
to realign this, as well as some fluid.</font>

165
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,950
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

166
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,450
<font color="yellow">Large bags of warm saline,
c-lines, Foleys, and intubators.</font>

167
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,140
<font color="yellow">Five of each, please.</font>

168
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,650
<font color="yellow">- Empty out this hybrid room...
- Where should I go?</font>

169
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,210
<font color="yellow">and empty all of
these beds here, too.</font>

170
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,340
<font color="yellow">And move all of the patients
in the D-zone inside.</font>

171
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,500
<font color="yellow">- Teacher Kim!
- Yes?</font>

172
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,220
<font color="yellow">The first patient will
be here in three minutes.</font>

173
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,830
<font color="yellow">It's a four-year-old female child.</font>

174
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,350
<font color="yellow">According to Doctor Kang, she has some
muscle guarding around her abdomen</font>

175
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,350
<font color="yellow">so she may have a seat belt injury.</font>

176
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,390
<font color="yellow">Leave the scene of the
accident in Yoon Seo Jung's care</font>

177
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,140
<font color="yellow">and call Kang Dong Joo
to the hospital.</font>

178
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,140
<font color="yellow">Right away, sir.</font>

179
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,050
<font color="yellow">- Nurse Park.
- Yes?</font>

180
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,350
<font color="yellow">What about the female patient
with Boerhaave syndrome?</font>

181
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,370
<font color="yellow">Doctor Nam Do Il is preparing
her for surgery right now.</font>

182
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,240
<font color="yellow">Call Doctor Yang from Jungil Hospital
and entrust the surgery to him</font>

183
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,850
<font color="yellow">and entrust the four-year-old girl
coming in now to Doctor Nam.</font>

184
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

185
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:29,050
<font color="yellow">Are you going to continue
being difficult, Doctor Bu Yong Joo?</font>

186
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,520
<font color="yellow">- Why, you...
- Hey.</font>

187
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,720
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear?</font>

188
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,050
<font color="yellow">It's a six-car accident.</font>

189
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,850
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do here,
when people's lives are at stake?</font>

190
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,050
<font color="yellow">I'm just doing my duty.</font>

191
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,480
<font color="yellow">That's what I get paid to do, after all.</font>

192
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,240
<font color="yellow">No, you're just on a power trip
and ignoring the situation at hand!</font>

193
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,390
<font color="yellow">Are you going to take responsibility
if someone ends up dying, at this rate?</font>

194
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,670
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

195
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,350
<font color="yellow">none of this would've happened if you'd
just followed orders from the beginning.</font>

196
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,450
<font color="yellow">This is your own fault,
so you can't blame us for it.</font>

197
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,740
<font color="yellow">Why, you idiotic little bastard.</font>

198
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,050
<font color="yellow">We have a patient!</font>

199
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,140
<font color="yellow">It's a four-year-old girl,
and she's unconscious.</font>

200
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,660
<font color="yellow">Her capillary refill time is falling!</font>

201
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,850
<font color="yellow">We'll have to get her
into the hybrid room!</font>

202
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,950
<font color="yellow">Doctor, please save my Eun Seol!</font>

so please take them to a big hospital.</font>

206
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, we will.</font>

207
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,850
<font color="yellow">You two surgeons head
back to the hospital now.</font>

208
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,850
<font color="yellow">I'll take a look at the remaining
injured patients before I go.</font>

209
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,550
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

210
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,450
<font color="yellow">See you at the hospital.</font>

211
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,850
<font color="yellow">Yeah. See you at the hospital.</font>

212
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,350
<font color="yellow">- Oh man.
- What's the matter?</font>

213
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,450
<font color="yellow">Is his condition bad?</font>

214
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,140
<font color="yellow">He drank so damn much
that he's throwing up now.</font>

215
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,850
<font color="yellow">Oh... water.</font>

216
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,850
<font color="yellow">Give me some water.</font>

217
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,850
<font color="yellow">Water, okay?
Do you have any water, Sis?</font>

218
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,640
<font color="yellow">What's his blood alcohol level?</font>

219
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,550
<font color="yellow">He refuses to comply. He says that he'll
get a blood test at the police station.</font>

220
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,380
<font color="yellow">I said let's go.
Let's go, man!</font>

221
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,050
<font color="yellow">I'll let you take my blood
at the police station.</font>

222
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,960
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

223
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,240
<font color="yellow">Well, sure. We'll do that,
if that's what you want.</font>

224
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,240
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

225
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,740
<font color="yellow">You're pretty.</font>

226
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,970
<font color="yellow">Wow, that was fast.</font>

227
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,450
<font color="yellow">All done.</font>

228
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,450
<font color="yellow">I'm guessing his BAC
will be around .451.</font>

229
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

230
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,850

231
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,950
<font color="yellow">Don't go driving after you've
had so much damn alcohol.</font>

232
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,850
<font color="yellow">That's essentially the same as
committing murder, you son of a bitch.</font>

233
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,950
<font color="yellow">Hey, Sis!</font>

234
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,850
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

235
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,950

00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,850
<font color="yellow">I'm the Crazy Whale of Doldam Hospital.</font>

<font color="yellow">Her spleen is damaged, and the
capsule surrounding it is torn.</font>

241
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,250
<font color="yellow">- Doctor.
- Yeah?</font>

242
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,640
<font color="yellow">We have the results of the
CT scan. Come over here.</font>

243
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,250
<font color="yellow">This is the spleen.
You see the dark bits?</font>

244
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,050
<font color="yellow">It means that there's bleeding there.</font>

245
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,850
<font color="yellow">Is her condition really bad, sir?</font>

246
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,850
<font color="yellow">Well, she is a toddler, so...</font>

247
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,050
<font color="yellow">it's risky to even put her
under general anesthesia.</font>

248
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:22,050
<font color="yellow">But if we don't operate on her, she'll
be in danger due to heavy blood loss.</font>

249
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,850
<font color="yellow">Oh... oh no!</font>

250
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,440
<font color="yellow">Operating on children is different
than operating on adults.</font>

251
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,030
<font color="yellow">The only person at this hospital
who can operate on her is me.</font>

252
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,250
<font color="yellow">Well?</font>

253
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,850
<font color="yellow">Are you still planning
to get in my way?</font>

254
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,850
<font color="yellow">Rules... are rules, after all.</font>

255
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,440
<font color="yellow">She may be my daughter, but...</font>

256
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,050
<font color="yellow">I can't just change the rules
all of the sudden because of this.</font>

257
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,750
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

258
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,250
<font color="yellow">Geez, you pathetic bastard.</font>

259
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,750
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

260
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,750
<font color="yellow">I'll do my job, so you do yours.</font>

261
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:23,350
<font color="yellow">Because I have to operate on this child,
no matter what you choose to do to me.</font>

262
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,140
<font color="yellow">It seems that you don't quite get it yet</font>

263
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,440
<font color="yellow">but doctors have only one job.</font>

264
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,050
<font color="yellow">And that job is to save the patient,
no matter what it takes.</font>

265
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,550
<font color="yellow">All right, bring this child to the OR.</font>

266
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,850
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

267
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,930
<font color="yellow">We need the guardian to come
and sign the consent form, please.</font>

268
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,930
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

269
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,640
<font color="yellow">We have a patient!</font>

270
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,440
<font color="yellow">- This way, please.
- This way.</font>

271
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, this way.</font>

272
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,250
<font color="yellow">This way.</font>

273
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,350
<font color="yellow">She's a woman in her 20s. She was
upside down in car, held by a seatbelt.</font>

274
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,850
<font color="yellow">Please give her a
cervical spine x-ray.</font>

275
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,940
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

276

<font color="yellow">- Hey, Kang Dong Joo.
- Yes?</font>

277
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,750
<font color="yellow">You told me there was a patient with an
open fracture. What happened with him?</font>

lower leg open fractures</font>

281
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,850
<font color="yellow">Senior Seo Jung will come back after
the other patients are taken care of.</font>

282
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,850
<font color="yellow">We have two patients in need of surgery.</font>

one of you has experience with Boerhaave?</font>

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,050
<font color="yellow">I've done it once before.</font>

286
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,350
<font color="yellow">- With a laparoscope?
- Yes.</font>

287
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,550
<font color="yellow">Okay. Then you be the
main surgeon, Do In Bum.</font>

288
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,850
<font color="yellow">And you assist, Kang Dong Joo.</font>

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,440
<font color="yellow">The patient's BP isn't too good,
and he's still bleeding out.</font>

297
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,050
<font color="yellow">Oh man...</font>

298
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,850
<font color="yellow">I thought you said
you've done this surgery before.</font>

299
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,550
<font color="yellow">I'm just doing one more simulation.
Is there something wrong with that?</font>

300
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:11,640
<font color="yellow">No. I'll go and get ready then,
Doctor Do In Bum.</font>

301
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,050
<font color="yellow">Are you ready, Doctor Nam?</font>

302
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,640
<font color="yellow">Doctor Nam.</font>

303
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,850
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Let's start.</font>

304
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
<font color="yellow">Knife.</font>

305
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,750
<font color="yellow">Trocar.</font>

306
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,440
<font color="yellow">Scope.</font>

307
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,640
<font color="yellow">Scalpel.</font>

308
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,550
<font color="yellow">I'm opening up the peritoneum now.
Please monitor her vitals.</font>

309
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,350
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

310
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,050
<font color="yellow">Eul Seol said that she
wanted to see her dad...</font>

311
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:48,350
<font color="yellow">and you said that you'd be staying here
longer than you'd originally thought</font>

312
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,550
<font color="yellow">so I packed some clothes
and other things for you</font>

313
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,550
<font color="yellow">and we were on our way
to come see you.</font>

314
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,750
<font color="yellow">Why did you take the car seat out?</font>

315
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,850
<font color="yellow">Because she kept telling me
that she didn't want to sit in it.</font>

316
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,350
<font color="yellow">It's not like we knew that
we'd get into an accident!</font>

317
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,140
<font color="yellow">Please move out of the way!</font>

318
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,750
<font color="yellow">We have patients coming in!</font>

319
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,560
<font color="yellow">Hey, how could you bring
orthopedic patients here?</font>

320
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,640
<font color="yellow">What else were we supposed to do?</font>

321
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,690
<font color="yellow">Was I supposed to leave them to die
while going from hospital to hospital?</font>

322
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,550
<font color="yellow">Look at you,
saying unpleasant things again!</font>

323
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,050
<font color="yellow">There were no supplies in the ambulance
and they're bleeding quite a lot.</font>

324
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,550
<font color="yellow">We'll find a hospital to transfer them
to while giving them transfusions.</font>

325
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,670
<font color="yellow">Hey, we're overflowing with
emergency patients as it is!</font>

326
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,500
<font color="yellow">Light or heavy.
Which one do you want to do?</font>

327
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,250
<font color="yellow">Light.</font>

328
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,140
<font color="yellow">Okay.
Can you hear me, sir?</font>

329
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,640
<font color="yellow">BP is 90/60, with 120 bpm.</font>

330
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,050
<font color="yellow">Change the drip from the
ambulance to a warm saline</font>

331
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,780
<font color="yellow">and put one more line in him
for two total liters of hydration.</font>

332
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,440
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Doctor.
- Scissor!</font>

333
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,840
<font color="yellow">Please bear it for a bit, Patient!
I'll be cutting the bandages off.</font>

334
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,980
<font color="yellow">Please prepare a bandage
and a splint, please.</font>

335
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,070
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

336
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,850
<font color="yellow">I think it's this side,
but I can't see the perforation.</font>

337
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,640
<font color="yellow">Pull the scope out a bit.</font>

338
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,350
<font color="yellow">I told you to pull it out a bit!</font>

339
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,250
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?
Should we call Teacher Kim?</font>

340
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,050
<font color="yellow">Hey, Doctor Do In Bum!</font>

341
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,750
<font color="yellow">No. I'll do it.</font>

342
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,440
<font color="yellow">I found it.</font>

343
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,850
<font color="yellow">Here's the tear site.</font>

344
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,440
<font color="yellow">Suture number 3.</font>

345
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,140
<font color="yellow">All done.</font>

346
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,850
<font color="yellow">We'll be doing the fundoplication now.</font>

347
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,440
<font color="yellow">One more suture number 3, please.</font>

348
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,050
<font color="yellow">Hey, how's your patient?</font>

349
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,440
<font color="yellow">I think we'll have to amputate
both of his legs below the knee.</font>

350
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,250
<font color="yellow">He has a severe fracture
near the back of his skull, too.</font>

351
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,850
<font color="yellow">- Is it wide?
- About 10 palms.</font>

352
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,250
<font color="yellow">Same with this patient.
He has no pulse near his foot.</font>

353
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,850
<font color="yellow">How did it go with finding a
hospital to transfer them to?</font>

354
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,850
<font color="yellow">I'm looking into it now,
but it hasn't been easy.</font>

355
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,850
<font color="yellow">Ask Chief Jang to help us, too.</font>

356
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,550
<font color="yellow">He has some personal connections.</font>

357
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,550
<font color="yellow">Will do, Doctor.</font>

358
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:14,640
<font color="yellow">All right. Shall we tend to the
other guests waiting for us, then?</font>

359
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,350
<font color="yellow">The left side...</font>

360
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,250
<font color="yellow">and the right side.</font>

361
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,350
<font color="yellow">The left side.</font>

362
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,550
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of the
right side first, then.</font>

363
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,300
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

364
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,350
<font color="yellow">Why did they bring
orthopedic patients here?</font>

365
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,850
<font color="yellow">No hospitals would accept them</font>

366
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,050
<font color="yellow">and their condition isn't
too good, I'm afraid.</font>

367
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:39,940
<font color="yellow">Oh geez. Looks like Doctor
Yoon Seo Jung caused trouble again.</font>

368
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,640
<font color="yellow">Are you still having
trouble breathing, sir?</font>

369
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,850
<font color="yellow">I'm a lot better now.</font>

370
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,960
<font color="yellow">To be honest, tomorrow is our
54th wedding anniversary.</font>

371
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,140
<font color="yellow">Wow, really? You two have been
together for 54 years now?</font>

372
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,440
<font color="yellow">My missus married me
when she was 19, so...</font>

373
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,140
<font color="yellow">- Oh, stop it!
- she's suffered a lot.</font>

374
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,440
<font color="yellow">The doctor is in the
middle of examining you.</font>

375
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,850
<font color="yellow">Please take a deep breath.</font>

376
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,850
<font color="yellow">We'll give you some more oxygen and
get your breathing back to normal.</font>

377
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,440
<font color="yellow">And what about you, ma'am?
Are you hurt anywhere?</font>

378
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,110
<font color="yellow">Did you hit yourself against
something hard, or...</font>

379
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,560
<font color="yellow">Nothing like that, but...</font>

380
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,850
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's because I was so
shocked, but my heart is beating so fast.</font>

381
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,250
<font color="yellow">My missus's heart hasn't
ever been too good, you see.</font>

382
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,850
<font color="yellow">Could you give me your hand, please?</font>

383
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,350
<font color="yellow">Your heart rate is a bit fast.</font>

384
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,550
<font color="yellow">Does your heart feel stiff?
Or do you feel pain anywhere else?</font>

385
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sure it's just the shock.</font>

386
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:25,440
<font color="yellow">I'm fine, so please get
my husband feeling better first.</font>

387
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,250
<font color="yellow">Please be sure to tell me if you
feel any pain anywhere. All right?</font>

388
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,140
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, Doctor.</font>

389
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,940
<font color="yellow">- How old are you right now?
- Oh, there you go again.</font>

390
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

391
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,250
<font color="yellow">I'm just asking because she looks like
she's about the same age as our youngest.</font>

392
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,850
<font color="yellow">- Please get some more rest.
- Okay.</font>

393
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,550
<font color="yellow">Did you call the kids?</font>

394
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,350
<font color="yellow">I told them to take their time
since the roads are slippery.</font>

395
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,350
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

396
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,440
<font color="yellow">Get some shut-eye until they get here.</font>

397
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,850
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

398
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,850
<font color="yellow">Oh my, oh my.</font>

400
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,440
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth. This was your
first time doing that, wasn't it?</font>

401
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,440
<font color="yellow">You were lying about having
done it once before. Right?</font>

402
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,140
<font color="yellow">Well, it wasn't really
a difficult surgery.</font>

403
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,870
<font color="yellow">And it was successful in the end.
Isn't that good enough?</font>

404
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,850
<font color="yellow">You think that surgery is a joke?</font>

405
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,050
<font color="yellow">Well, of course it's not.</font>

406
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,940
<font color="yellow">But it's nothing to risk
your own life over, either.</font>

407
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,140
<font color="yellow">Looks like he got you this time.</font>

408
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,220
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

409
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,850
<font color="yellow">This is what you like, right?
Coffee with both cream and sugar.</font>

410
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,250
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

411
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,850
<font color="yellow">Please, have this.</font>

412
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,050
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

413
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,140
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Doctor.</font>

414
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:56,250
<font color="yellow">Have you ever thought that
you wanted to quit your job?</font>

415
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,350
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me that
all of the sudden?</font>

416
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,850
<font color="yellow">When you felt like you wanted to quit...</font>

417
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,140
<font color="yellow">how did you overcome that
feeling and get through it?</font>

418
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,850
<font color="yellow">I was just curious.</font>

419
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,850
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't know.</font>

420
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,440
<font color="yellow">I feel like I couldn't quit</font>

421
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,750
<font color="yellow">if only because all my suffering up
until now would've been for nothing.</font>

422
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,050
<font color="yellow">And I don't have the confidence that
I'd be better at anything else if I quit.</font>

423
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,850
<font color="yellow">Is that... all?</font>

424
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,640
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a personal
conviction as a doctor</font>

425
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,350
<font color="yellow">or feel like you had a personal
calling to this profession?</font>

426
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:40,550
<font color="yellow">I think you'd have to work for at least
10 years to have either of those things.</font>

427
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,140
<font color="yellow">Because talking the talk is
different than walking the walk.</font>

428
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,550
<font color="yellow">I got a call from the ER.
I have to go.</font>

429
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,140
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the coffee!</font>

430
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

431
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,870
<font color="yellow">His BP is rising and the
bleeding is getting worse.</font>

432
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,850
<font color="yellow">Decrease the amount of fluids
and get me a c-line and a Foley.</font>

433
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,940
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

434
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,550
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of inserting the c-line.</font>

435
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,350
<font color="yellow">Can I get the Foley, please?</font>

436
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,550
<font color="yellow">Doctor! The patient at bed five
is going into cardiac arrest!</font>

437
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,050
<font color="yellow">Take care of the c-line here for me!</font>

438
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, Senior!</font>

439
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,550
<font color="yellow">Doctor! My wife isn't breathing!</font>

440
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,050

Go ahead, Senior.</font>

590

wake up Nurse Oh for you?</font>

she was up all last night, huh?</font>

so early in the morning?</font>

for what happened before</font>

about her was good</font>

616
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,850
<font color="yellow">and the patient who received the
expensive treatment is conscious now.</font>

617
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,070
<font color="yellow">So you didn't come here to
apologize to me, per se.</font>

618
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,840
<font color="yellow">You came to rub all of this in my face.</font>

619

and I was wrong.</font>

Do you like it?</font>

634

So I told them to get you a new one.</font>

What about Ms. Yeon Hwa?</font>

641
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,890

She just left without a word.</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.
That's too bad.</font>
