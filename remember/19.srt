<font color="yellow">Mr Nam,</font>

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,360

<font color="yellow">Mr Tak.</font>

6
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,200
<font color="yellow">What is she doing here?</font>

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,990
<font color="yellow">I thought you wanted to change the prosecutor for his third trial.</font>

8
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,930
<font color="yellow">I am the prosecutor in charge of Nam Kyu Man's case.</font>

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,790
<font color="yellow">I will seek justice.</font>

10

<font color="yellow">Mr Tak.</font>

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,290
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,890
<font color="yellow">This means Mr Tak's business at Ilho Group is finished.</font>

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,760
<font color="yellow">It was difficult for me to keep this secret.</font>

14
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,760
<font color="yellow">I feel much more relieved now.</font>

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,960
<font color="yellow">Mr Tak,</font>

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,090
<font color="yellow">how could you...</font>

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,090
<font color="yellow">Crazy jerks!</font>

<font color="yellow">Gosh! Seo Jin Woo!</font>

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,990
<font color="yellow">You are here.</font>

20
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,990
<font color="yellow">Did you watch...</font>

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
<font color="yellow">the video I sent you?</font>

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,590
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. You're dead.</font>

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,290
<font color="yellow">It sounds like...</font>

24
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,960
<font color="yellow">you did watch it.</font>

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did!</font>

26
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,590
<font color="yellow">Do you think doing this would change anything?</font>

27
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,990
<font color="yellow">What will you get by distributing a video that has no legal force?</font>

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,590
<font color="yellow">People will watch the video and then you'll see.</font>

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,190
<font color="yellow">All you need to do is to wait for the law...</font>

30

<font color="yellow">to give you the punishment you deserve.</font>

31
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,390
<font color="yellow">I am a man...</font>

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,460
<font color="yellow">who can play around with the law. Haven't you seen what I've done?</font>

33
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,590
<font color="yellow">No, I've seen enough.</font>

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,490
<font color="yellow">But the important thing is...</font>

35
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,990
<font color="yellow">that you are not the one who is above the law.</font>

36
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,990
<font color="yellow">It's the truth.</font>

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,560
<font color="yellow">But will you remember the truth? I know you're ill.</font>

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,960
<font color="yellow">You better focus on remembering yourself.</font>

39
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,730
<font color="yellow">I may forget who I am,</font>

40
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,460
<font color="yellow">but I won't forget the truth...</font>

41
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,590
<font color="yellow">behind my father's death.</font>

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,660
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at court, Nam Kyu Man.</font>

43
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,990
<font color="yellow">I won't!</font>

44
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,300
<font color="yellow">I will never go to court, you jerk!</font>

45
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,560
<font color="yellow">My goodness! I will kill him!</font>

46
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,090
<font color="yellow">This is killing me.</font>

47
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,490
<font color="yellow">Does this mean...</font>

48
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,560
<font color="yellow">that I have fallen into...</font>

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,690
<font color="yellow">Mr Tak's trap?</font>

50
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,830
<font color="yellow">You are an interesting man.</font>

51
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,830
<font color="yellow">I hear that often.</font>

52
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,590
<font color="yellow">I'm known for never working for anyone.</font>

53
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,690
<font color="yellow">Do you think such a trick would destroy me?</font>

54
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,090
<font color="yellow">What's your purpose of doing this?</font>

55
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,090
<font color="yellow">It's to let the world know of the true faces of yours...</font>

56
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,930
<font color="yellow">that have been manipulating the law with money and power.</font>

57
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,890
<font color="yellow">I'd like to know...</font>

58
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,490
<font color="yellow">that true face of mine myself.</font>

59
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,190
<font color="yellow">You will see it soon...</font>

60
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,590
<font color="yellow">when you go to court.</font>

61
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,690
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

62
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,560
<font color="yellow">everything is over for you.</font>

63
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,190
<font color="yellow">You should've let me know.</font>

64
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,860
<font color="yellow">I'm a little upset.</font>

65
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,990
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

66
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,690
<font color="yellow">I tried really hard to stop myself...</font>

67
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,860
<font color="yellow">from punching you in the face.</font>

68
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,360
<font color="yellow">I had to make you become suspicious of me...</font>

69
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,730
<font color="yellow">to completely fool that old snake, Nam Il Ho.</font>

70
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,760
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

71
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,460
<font color="yellow">You will never know...</font>

72
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,830
<font color="yellow">how sick I felt when I had to flatter Nam Il Ho.</font>

73
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,890
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I know that?</font>

74
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,660
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

75
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,990
<font color="yellow">Here you are.</font>

76
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,490
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

77
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,390
<font color="yellow">How does it feel to work as a prosecutor again?</font>

78
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,090
<font color="yellow">I am Lee In Ah.</font>

79
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,290
<font color="yellow">I recommend her as an experienced prosecutor.</font>

80
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,960
<font color="yellow">She is very passionate and determined, too.</font>

81
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,390
<font color="yellow">I heard you are...</font>

82
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,390
<font color="yellow">the person who planted Mr Tak in Ilho Group.</font>

83
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,390
<font color="yellow">I've always been a troublemaker for Mr Tak...</font>

84
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,290
<font color="yellow">for acting hastily only on my passion.</font>

85
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,360
<font color="yellow">I always thought the problematic ones were those who only...</font>

86
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,100
<font color="yellow">care about how to please their superiors and acting complacently.</font>

87
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,490
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

88
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,390
<font color="yellow">do the best of your ability.</font>

89
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,600
<font color="yellow">I will do my best.</font>

90
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,690
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure yet.</font>

91
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,290
<font color="yellow">The prosecutor general supports you. Why are you worried?</font>

92
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,690
<font color="yellow">What if I feel sceptical about the prosecution again...</font>

93
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,390
<font color="yellow">and what if I have to compromise...</font>

94
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,790
<font color="yellow">It wasn't the prosecution, it was a person...</font>

95
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,390
<font color="yellow">that made you feel sceptical.</font>

96
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,360
<font color="yellow">You should've seen Hong Moo Suk's face when he saw me.</font>

97
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

99
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,690
<font color="yellow">You'll do better than anyone.</font>

100
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,990

<font color="yellow">What? A murderer?</font>

159
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,590
<font color="yellow">Did you say a murderer?</font>

160
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,790
<font color="yellow">Die! Die, you idiot!</font>

161
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,230
<font color="yellow">Die, you idiot!</font>

162
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,890
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir. Please forgive me.</font>

163
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,130
<font color="yellow">What? A murderer? Die!</font>

164
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,790
<font color="yellow">You'll be killed by a murderer. Just die!</font>

165
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't know a person would die so easily.</font>

166
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,990
<font color="yellow">The confession video has been released.</font>

167
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,990
<font color="yellow">The retrial is on.</font>

168
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,130
<font color="yellow">They are in deep trouble.</font>

169
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,390
<font color="yellow">Nam Il Ho and Nam Kyu Man...</font>

170
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,200
<font color="yellow">won't be able to turn the case to their favour.</font>

171
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,390
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man is completely cornered.</font>

172
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,790
<font color="yellow">Now we need witnesses who'll help us finish him.</font>

173
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,700
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't Gwak Han Soo be a sure witness?</font>

174
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,130
<font color="yellow">We need one more.</font>

175
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,490
<font color="yellow">Someone who knows about this case very well.</font>

176
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,290
<font color="yellow">Someone who is close to Nam Kyu Man.</font>

177
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,360
<font color="yellow">An Soo Beom.</font>

178
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,890
<font color="yellow">It won't be impossible if we ask Judge Kang.</font>

179
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
<font color="yellow">I heard you took over the trial in place of Chae Jin Kyung.</font>

180
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,090
<font color="yellow">I am going to indict Kyu Man...</font>

181
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,490
<font color="yellow">for all the crimes he committed.</font>

182
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,990
<font color="yellow">I want to see him finished.</font>

183
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,490
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

184
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,290
<font color="yellow">Please go on.</font>

185
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,130
<font color="yellow">Could you please help me call...</font>

186
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,490
<font color="yellow">Soo Beom as a witness to the retrial?</font>

187
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,790
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

188
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,090
<font color="yellow">But I will talk to him.</font>

189
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,890
<font color="yellow">(AN SOO BEOM)</font>

190
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,700
<font color="yellow">Your call has been forwarded to the voice mail service.</font>

191
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,990
<font color="yellow">Hello...</font>

192
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,790
<font color="yellow">Hello... I'm in here.</font>

193
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,990
<font color="yellow">Help me.</font>

194
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,790
<font color="yellow">Help me.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm in here.</font>

196
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,700
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

197
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,130
<font color="yellow">You'll be killed by a murderer. Just die!</font>

198
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,490
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

199
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,700
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stop the video from spreading.</font>

200
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,230
<font color="yellow">But I had him drop the charges.</font>

201
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,390
<font color="yellow">You won't be going to court for this.</font>

202
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,790
<font color="yellow">Are you joking with me?</font>

203
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,590
<font color="yellow">With the salary you get from me, is this all you can do?</font>

204
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,290
<font color="yellow">You should've been careful.</font>

205
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,490
<font color="yellow">- What?
- All eyes are on you...</font>

206
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,790
<font color="yellow">because of the confession video.</font>

207
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,060
<font color="yellow">What's the situation like?</font>

208
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,130
<font color="yellow">With the third trial coming up,</font>

209
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,390
<font color="yellow">we have to be prepared for the worst.</font>

210
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,990
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

211
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,060
<font color="yellow">I sincerely apologise for...</font>

212
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,490
<font color="yellow">the trouble my son has caused.</font>

213
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,590
<font color="yellow">As the chairman of Ilho Group and...</font>

214
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,490
<font color="yellow">as Nam Kyu Man's father,</font>

215
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,990
<font color="yellow">I ask of your forgiveness.</font>

216
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,890
<font color="yellow">Please blame me.</font>

217
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,690
<font color="yellow">It is all my fault.</font>

218
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,590
<font color="yellow">Regardless of the court's ruling,</font>

219
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,390
<font color="yellow">Nam Kyu Man will resign his current position as the president...</font>

220
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,390
<font color="yellow">as well as all the titles he has...</font>

<font color="yellow">reverted to the state.</font>

224
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,490
<font color="yellow">I would like to apologise again...</font>

225
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,690
<font color="yellow">and ask you for your forgiveness once more.</font>

226
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,890
<font color="yellow">Gosh,</font>

227
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,390
<font color="yellow">the years of experience under your belts are incredible.</font>

228
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,390
<font color="yellow">You are quick at managing crisis.</font>

229
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,390
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to provoke us?</font>

230
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,790
<font color="yellow">You might have put out a small fire just now.</font>

231
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,890
<font color="yellow">But it's too late to save your house that's burning down.</font>

232
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,590
<font color="yellow">Don't think that...</font>

233
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,690
<font color="yellow">my son and I will go down so easily, Dong Ho.</font>

234
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,130
<font color="yellow">A son and his father are one, aren't they?</font>

235
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,190
<font color="yellow">Jin Woo and I will put you two to jail.</font>

236
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,090
<font color="yellow">Just consider it as taking a life lesson.</font>

237
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,390
<font color="yellow">Get out of our way.</font>

238
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,490
<font color="yellow">You're still deluded.</font>

239
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,490
<font color="yellow">You're the one who's deluded.</font>

240
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,990
<font color="yellow">You're Ilho Group's hound.</font>

241
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,290
<font color="yellow">Don't trust...</font>

242
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,590
<font color="yellow">Hong Moo Suk too much.</font>

243
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,290
<font color="yellow">There's no one that can be trusted, is there?</font>

244
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,890
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

245
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,990
<font color="yellow">In Ah, you're here.</font>

246
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,390
<font color="yellow">- Did you move all your things home?
- Yes.</font>

<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

248
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,130
<font color="yellow">You know I'm back at the prosecutor's office, right?</font>

249
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,290
<font color="yellow">You always do whatever you like.</font>

250
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,990
<font color="yellow">What's the point of letting me know afterwards?</font>

251
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,690
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

252
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,990
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I made you worry.</font>

253
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,390
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you like. An attorney or a prosecutor.</font>

254
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,390
<font color="yellow">But I won't let you be with Jin Woo.</font>

255
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,790
<font color="yellow">- Mum.
- In Ah,</font>

256
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,090
<font color="yellow">Jin Woo will only get worse.</font>

257
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,390

<font color="yellow">the real killer at the retrial,</font>

263
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,390

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,890
<font color="yellow">It'll be 20 years at most.</font>

265

<font color="yellow">how could you take away all my positions...</font>

268
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,390
<font color="yellow">I had no choice. It was for the group.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why are you still saying that?</font>

273
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,860
<font color="yellow">The chairman is doing everything in his power...</font>

274

<font color="yellow">to remedy the situation.</font>

275

<font color="yellow">after the trial.</font>

279
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,960
<font color="yellow">I pulled you out of all of your positions...</font>

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,890
<font color="yellow">I'm repenting.</font>

284
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,190

285
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,390
<font color="yellow">Detective Gwak,</font>

286
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,960

<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

288
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,490
<font color="yellow">I should stay until all of my sins are washed away.</font>

<font color="yellow">The chairman can get you out immediately.</font>

290
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,290
<font color="yellow">What does he want...</font>

291
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,690
<font color="yellow">in return?</font>

292
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,890
<font color="yellow">Say that the confession video that you gave Seo Jin Woo...</font>

293
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,690
<font color="yellow">was made under coercion.</font>

294
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,490
<font color="yellow">And at the retrial,</font>

295
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,490
<font color="yellow">don't say anything and keep your mouth shut.</font>

296
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,890
<font color="yellow">Where's Soo Beom?</font>

297
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,190
<font color="yellow">This sounds like Suk Kyu.</font>

298
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,690
<font color="yellow">Did you see my father's press conference?</font>

299
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,890
<font color="yellow">I've been fired from my position as the president.</font>

300
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,390
<font color="yellow">Is this what you wanted?</font>

301
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,990
<font color="yellow">Where is Soo Beom?</font>

302
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,690
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me?</font>

303
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,590
<font color="yellow">You're the reason I can't reach him, aren't you?</font>

304
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,860
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

305
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,190
<font color="yellow">trying to calm myself down. Don't do this to me.</font>

306
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,090
<font color="yellow">Don't try to hide anything else from me, and tell me where he is.</font>

307
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,090
<font color="yellow">He quit,</font>

308
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
<font color="yellow">saying he didn't want to clean up after me.</font>

309
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,860
<font color="yellow">He should have landed in the States by now.</font>

310
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,060
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

311
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,400
<font color="yellow">I really hope that's true.</font>

312
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,490
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see how low you can go any more.</font>

313
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,590
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

314
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,590
<font color="yellow">Ms Lee,</font>

315
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,790
<font color="yellow">Soo Beom has disappeared.</font>

316
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,290
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man says he left for the States.</font>

317
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
<font color="yellow">Border control says...</font>

318
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,190
<font color="yellow">he left this morning.</font>

319
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,190
<font color="yellow">He didn't call you first?</font>

320
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,490
<font color="yellow">No, he didn't.</font>

321
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,400
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

322
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,990
<font color="yellow">I think Kyu Man is behind it.</font>

323
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,400
<font color="yellow">I'll look as well.</font>

324
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,960
<font color="yellow">Okay, In Ah. I'll look too.</font>

325
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,090
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

326
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,590
<font color="yellow">Nam Kyu Man did something to Soo Beom.</font>

327
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,900
<font color="yellow">He's still causing trouble even during the trial.</font>

328
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,400
<font color="yellow">Please look for places...</font>

329
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,960
<font color="yellow">where he could be hiding An Soo Beom.</font>

330
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,690
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

331
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,400
<font color="yellow">The person you have dialled is not available.</font>

332
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,790
<font color="yellow">Please leave a message after the tone.</font>

333
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,960
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

334
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,790
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he picking up?</font>

335
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,490
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

336
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,290
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

337
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,490
<font color="yellow">I can't reach Soo Beom.</font>

338
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,990
<font color="yellow">- You can't reach him?
- No.</font>

339
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,190
<font color="yellow">Maybe something happened.</font>

340
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,190
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

341
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,760
<font color="yellow">He did say jokingly that...</font>

342
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,090
<font color="yellow">Nam Kyu Man will kill him.</font>

343
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,900
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

344
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,400
<font color="yellow">Something definitely happened.</font>

345
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,090
<font color="yellow">Jin Woo must have Soo Beom on his side.</font>

346
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,690
<font color="yellow">I need to repay my debt.</font>

347
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,990
<font color="yellow">Call your boys.</font>

348
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,860
<font color="yellow">I'll do it my way.</font>

349
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,990
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dong Ho.</font>

350
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
<font color="yellow">Hi, how have you been?</font>

351
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,760
<font color="yellow">Hello. It's been a while.</font>

352
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,760
<font color="yellow">What brings you by today?</font>

353
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,590
<font color="yellow">Find this person for me like you did the other time.</font>

354
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,590
<font color="yellow">Have some coffee while you wait. I'll be done in 30 minutes.</font>

355
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,860
<font color="yellow">Forget the coffee. Get moving.</font>

356
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,760
<font color="yellow">Soo Beom.</font>

357
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,590
<font color="yellow">You can't sleep here. You'll get sick.</font>

358
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,290
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man,</font>

359
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,090
<font color="yellow">please let me live.</font>

360
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,490
<font color="yellow">You want to live?</font>

361
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,290
<font color="yellow">Then I'll give you one final chance.</font>

362
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,900
<font color="yellow">Go to that punk Seo Jin Woo...</font>

363
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,590
<font color="yellow">and bring the wine opener.</font>

364
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,090
<font color="yellow">I will do...</font>

365
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,790
<font color="yellow">anything other than that.</font>

366
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
<font color="yellow">Since when were you so stubborn? How did you hide it all these years?</font>

367
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,490
<font color="yellow">I'll live quietly.</font>

368
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,860
<font color="yellow">Please, let me live.</font>

369
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,760
<font color="yellow">You said you won't get me the wine opener,</font>

370
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,760
<font color="yellow">so why should I let you go?</font>

371
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,190
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make sense.</font>

372
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,290
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to bring it yourself,</font>

373
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,490
<font color="yellow">you can make Seo Jin Woo come here himself.</font>

374
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,790
<font color="yellow">The person he needs the most...</font>

375
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,400
<font color="yellow">is you.</font>

376
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,900
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man. Kyu Man...</font>

377
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,490
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man.</font>

378
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,790
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man.</font>

379
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,090
<font color="yellow">Kyu... Kyu Man.</font>

380
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,190
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man.</font>

381
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man.</font>

382
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:57,884
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

383
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,990
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

384
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,890
<font color="yellow">You're not Seo Jin Woo.</font>

385
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,090
<font color="yellow">Nam Kyu Man,</font>

386
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,890
<font color="yellow">you've gone over the edge.</font>

387
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,490
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

388
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,690
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

389
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,960
<font color="yellow">Did you want to see your friend who went ahead of you?</font>

390
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,190
<font color="yellow">Come here. I'll send you to him.</font>

391
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,190
<font color="yellow">Let's see how long you can talk.</font>

392
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,090
<font color="yellow">Let me take...</font>

393
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,090
<font color="yellow">Soo Beom.</font>

394
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,890
<font color="yellow">Get rid of him!</font>

395
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,590
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Kyu Man.</font>

396
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,490
<font color="yellow">It'll take at least a month for me to recover.</font>

397
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,790
<font color="yellow">You'll already get...</font>

398
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,290
<font color="yellow">a hefty sentence as it is.</font>

399
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,690
<font color="yellow">You'll make it longer. What will you do?</font>

400
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,690
<font color="yellow">What will I do?</font>

401
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,190
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of pent-up anger against you.</font>

402
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,060
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you a hefty settlement fee,</font>

403
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,760
<font color="yellow">so let me beat you today.</font>

404
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,390
<font color="yellow">I will never...</font>

405
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,590
<font color="yellow">settle.</font>

406
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,290
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man,</font>

407
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,690
<font color="yellow">let's follow the law.</font>

408
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,960
<font color="yellow">Follow the law? Whatever.</font>

409
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,790
<font color="yellow">Let's see who wins, the law or me!</font>

410
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,590
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

411
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,090
<font color="yellow">What are these gangster punks?</font>

412
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,690
<font color="yellow">Sang Ho, what took you so long?</font>

413
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,990
<font color="yellow">Dong Ho! Are you okay?</font>

414
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,830
<font color="yellow">Look how many I'm against!</font>

415
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,330
<font color="yellow">I got beaten up so much.</font>

416
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,390
<font color="yellow">It's time for you to get my revenge.</font>

417
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,930
<font color="yellow">Let's go, guys!</font>

418
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,990
<font color="yellow">- I'll get you!
- Get him!</font>

419
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,090
<font color="yellow">- Come on!
- Let's go!</font>

420
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,390
<font color="yellow">I'll get you!</font>

421
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,460
<font color="yellow">Take this...</font>

422
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,560
<font color="yellow">and this!</font>

423
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,490
<font color="yellow">You are both just gangsters,</font>

424
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,190
<font color="yellow">but why is my gang losing?</font>

425
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,490
<font color="yellow">Come on!</font>

426
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,290
<font color="yellow">You idiots.</font>

427
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,790
<font color="yellow">I'm done here.</font>

428
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,990
<font color="yellow">Soo Beom.</font>

429
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,830
<font color="yellow">Thank you for staying alive.</font>

430
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,930
<font color="yellow">Sang Ho.</font>

431
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,090
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

432
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,990
<font color="yellow">for saving my life.</font>

433
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,590
<font color="yellow">My goodness, aren't you two just a pair of lovebirds?</font>

434
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,590
<font color="yellow">Get a room, you two.</font>

435
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,560
<font color="yellow">Right, Soo Beom.</font>

436
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,890
<font color="yellow">How do you feel about staying in our office with us?</font>

437
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,830
<font color="yellow">It's too dangerous for you to go home.</font>

438
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,290
<font color="yellow">May I?</font>

439
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,390
<font color="yellow">Dong Ho, he can, can't he?</font>

440
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,390
<font color="yellow">Do as you'd like, Sang Ho.</font>

441
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,590
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much, Mr Park.</font>

442
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,290
<font color="yellow">And you are the only loyal man, Sang Ho.</font>

443
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,560
<font color="yellow">Did Mr An really switch sides?</font>

444
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,090
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

445
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,490
<font color="yellow">What would happen if he stands in the courts?</font>

446
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,190
<font color="yellow">The moment he witnesses,</font>

447
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,830
<font color="yellow">your retrial will be over.</font>

448
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,490
<font color="yellow">Then, Lee In Ah will accuse you for everything.</font>

449
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,290
<font color="yellow">In that case,</font>

450
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,730
<font color="yellow">you will be punished for killing Oh Jung Ah.</font>

451
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,590
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mr Hong.</font>

452
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,490
<font color="yellow">Save me.</font>

453
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,990
<font color="yellow">I do have one solution.</font>

454
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,390
<font color="yellow">This will be dangerous for me, too.</font>

455
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,390
<font color="yellow">We need to proceed without your father knowing.</font>

456
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,290
<font color="yellow">Without my father knowing?</font>

457
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,590
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

458
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,190
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

459
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,830
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to hand me...</font>

460
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,460
<font color="yellow">the golf resort in California which is under your name right now.</font>

461
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,390
<font color="yellow">All right, so tell me already.</font>

462
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,990
<font color="yellow">You fake your death...</font>

463
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,190
<font color="yellow">before you stand in the court.</font>

464
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,930
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Song.</font>

465
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,090
<font color="yellow">I just found out the last known location for Mr An.</font>

466
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,090
<font color="yellow">- The address is...
- Are you home?</font>

467
00:27:58,930 --> 00:27:59,930
<font color="yellow">Jin Woo!</font>

468
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,090
<font color="yellow">I just found a witness who'll bear witness on our retrial.</font>

469
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,830
<font color="yellow">I'll call you back.</font>

470
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,090
<font color="yellow">Weren't you just looking for Mr An?</font>

471
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,390
<font color="yellow">Jin Woo, sometimes illegal ways get things done faster than legal ways.</font>

472
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,460
<font color="yellow">Where is Mr An?</font>

473
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,290
<font color="yellow">It's me, Seo Jin Woo.</font>

474
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,190
<font color="yellow">I know it wasn't easy,</font>

475
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,090
<font color="yellow">but thanks to you, we were able to get the crucial evidence.</font>

476
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,560
<font color="yellow">I am prepared...</font>

477
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,890
<font color="yellow">to pay for my crimes.</font>

478
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,730
<font color="yellow">But it looked like...</font>

479
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,490
<font color="yellow">Nam Kyu Man wasn't interested in paying for his crimes.</font>

480
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,390
<font color="yellow">He's been hiding it for years. He wouldn't accept his fate.</font>

481
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,890
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm here...</font>

482
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,930
<font color="yellow">to ask you to stand...</font>

483
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,090
<font color="yellow">as a witness for the retrial.</font>

484
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,590
<font color="yellow">I will make sure...</font>

485
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,190
<font color="yellow">Nam Kyu Man gets punished by the law.</font>

486
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,590
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can bear witness.</font>

487
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,560
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I've learned over decades of watching him?</font>

488
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,590
<font color="yellow">If you fight against Kyu Man, you'll die.</font>

489
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,990
<font color="yellow">Kyu Man may be cornered at this moment,</font>

490
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,890
<font color="yellow">but I am scared and frightened.</font>

491
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,290
<font color="yellow">- I will protect you from...
- No!</font>

492
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,830
<font color="yellow">I won't bear witness...</font>

493
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,730
<font color="yellow">as long as Kyu Man is alive.</font>

494
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,830
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Are you telling me to die?</font>

495
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,390
<font color="yellow">Mr Nam, calm down.</font>

496
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,190
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about laundering your identity.</font>

497
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,790
<font color="yellow">First, go to China.</font>

498
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,930
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me...</font>

499
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,290
<font color="yellow">to stow away to China?</font>

500
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,490
<font color="yellow">And there, you'll become a dead man on papers.</font>

501
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,390
<font color="yellow">And you'll launder your identity...</font>

502
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,830
<font color="yellow">to become another person.</font>

503
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,090
<font color="yellow">Becoming another person, you say.</font>

504
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,990
<font color="yellow">After a while,</font>

505
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,590
<font color="yellow">you can come back as a new person to restart all your businesses.</font>

506
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,290
<font color="yellow">One thing is this.</font>

507
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,290
<font color="yellow">I hope it doesn't take too long.</font>

508
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,590
<font color="yellow">I hate living abroad.</font>

509
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,290
<font color="yellow">You know how things are.</font>

510
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,190
<font color="yellow">People never remember anything for long.</font>

511
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,930
<font color="yellow">You, Mr Nam...</font>

512
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,790
<font color="yellow">and Oh Jung Ah...</font>

513
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,090

520
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,990

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,090
<font color="yellow">what the most difficult thing about staying in here is?</font>

524
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,390
<font color="yellow">It's the fact that...</font>

525
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,730
<font color="yellow">I can't see you growing up.</font>

526
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,190
<font color="yellow">That's what makes me sad.</font>

<font color="yellow">I can only imagine, you know.</font>

528
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,730
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make more great memories with you.</font>

529

626
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,190
<font color="yellow">Because of the circumstances the informant is in,</font>

627
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,030
<font color="yellow">I cannot tell you, Your Honour.</font>

628

635
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,590
<font color="yellow">Yes. I...</font>

<font color="yellow">Very early in the morning after when the party was over,</font>

647
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,390
<font color="yellow">I ran over to the forest after getting a call...</font>

649

653

<font color="yellow">So I...</font>

654
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,930
<font color="yellow">hid the real murder weapon.</font>

655
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,930

<font color="yellow">the weapon that was presented five years ago,</font>

657
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,990
