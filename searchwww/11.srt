00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:19,813
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:21,953
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:24,453
(Episode 11)

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,631
Hi, I'm just about to leave.

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,000
Have fun.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,410
I'm going to go home and rest. Bye.

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,040
(Park Morgan)

8
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,280
He insists on going to the reunion?

9
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,390
Ms. Jung.

10
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,301
Ta Mi.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,900
You look really pretty today. Where are you going looking so nice?

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,900
I'm on my way to meet my first love.

13
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,140
Your first love? My gosh.

14
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,341
Which way are you headed?

15
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,511
I'll give you a ride if it's on the way.

16
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,380
I never saw him after I graduated.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,621
It's been over 10 years already.

18
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:16,681
I can't believe you're on your way to meet your first love.

19
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:18,121
How does it feel?

20
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:21,160
Like I'm getting a parcel I've been anticipating for 10 years.

21
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:23,421
I guess your heart's fluttering like crazy.

22
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,830
I don't know who he is, but he's one lucky guy...

23
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,901
to have a pretty woman like you get so excited over him.

24
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,630
You should just leave if he doesn't look as good as he used to.

25
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:32,931
Of course.

26
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,511
Something feels missing. I wonder what it is.

27
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,940
I know what it is.

28
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:50,351
These will make you look prettier. Do you want to wear them?

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,921
Yes, I want to wear them.

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,561
But you have to return them to me. There's a story behind them.

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,061
Of course.

32
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:03,231
How do I look? Do I look okay?

33
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,000
I think I might start liking women now.

34
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,940
I really envy that first love of yours.

35
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:12,240
There's my first love.

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,041
I can recognize him in an instant.

37
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,951
I think I should go inside.

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,851
Thank you, Ta Mi.

39
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:35,601
You shouldn't say that.

40
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:36,800
I only said that because it's you.

41
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:38,701
Da In?

42
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:41,140
Hello.

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,101
- Hey, Da In. - My gosh, it's so nice to see you.

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,671
My gosh, you guys haven't changed at all.

45
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:48,610
Hey, it's been so long.

46
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,041
Is that really you, Da In?

47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,851
I thought you were in Germany. When did you come back?

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,520
It's been a couple of months.

49
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,150
It's so nice to see you all.

50
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,261
Morgan, it's been so long.

51
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,661
Yes, it has.

52
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,860
He hasn't contacted me once.

53
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,471
What? Why do I suddenly see a fish tank?

54
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,310
I'm going to continue tasting the samples.

55
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,911
I just raided the pork belly corner, so it's time for dessert.

56
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:22,281
I'm in just the right place.

57
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,981
I'm going to try this delicious watermelon.

58
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:26,180
Thank you.

59
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,451
That will be the end of today's show.

60
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:33,890
Something urgent came up.

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,631
I know you saw me.

62
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,390
Why are you ignoring me like I'm a stranger?

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
I saw you eating watermelon. Was it delicious?

64
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,471
Yes.

65
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,300
Is Morgan still very handsome?

66
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:49,400
When are you going to break up with him?

67
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:51,370
Maybe today.

68
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,870
Nice. Already going through a rough patch.

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,941
Ta Mi, do you know you're setting a good example...

70
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,981
by dating a younger guy for young women like me?

71
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,881
You know the expression "to set an example"?

72
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,421
I'm only pretending to be dumb. People dig that kind of stuff.

73
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,721
Anyway, I'm also going to date a guy who's 20 years younger than me...

74
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:13,231
once I grow old and become famous.

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,830
But I can't do that right now. I can only do it once I'm old.

76
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,101
But you can date a guy who's 20 years younger than you.

77
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,000
You can date a guy who's younger than Morgan.

78
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,041
So just break up with him.

79
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,200
What kind of logic is that?

80
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,541
And I'd be dating a minor if I date someone who's 20 years younger.

81
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,911
Really?

82
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,750
I'm not really good at guessing old people's ages.

83
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,421
They're all just old to me.

84
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:36,550
Let's just drop it.

85
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:41,120
I'm sorry, but I can't break up with him today.

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
(Park Morgan)

87
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:44,331
010356550...

88
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,930
- I missed the last two digits. - Hello?

89
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,060
My gosh, that was so close.

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,461
No, I'm outside.

91
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,231
I think we'll all go home in about an hour.

92
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,771
It's the weekend, so we should meet. I miss you.

93
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,401
I also need to meet someone today.

94
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,771
So I don't think we can meet.

95
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,940
I'm a little busy.

96
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,411
Okay, have fun.

97
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,891
- I need to go to the bathroom. - It's over there.

98
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,531
Have you been well?

99
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:21,930
It's been 13 years since I've asked you that.

100
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,060
How was Australia?

101
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,430
Now that I look back, it was nice.

102
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,740
How was Germany?

103
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,310
Now that I look back, it was difficult.

104
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,180
You've grown so tall.

105
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,211
Yes. Someone even wishes to be 2m tall because of my height.

106
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:41,750
Just a second.

107
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,521
You should go.

108
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,461
Okay. Let me give you my number.

109
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,791
Let's stay in touch.

110
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:53,690
My cell phone's on the table. Just a second.

111
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,000
A business card?

112
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,231
You're an adult now.

113
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,041
"Millim Sound"?

114
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,341
What kind of music do you make?

115
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,541
- Please sign this. - Please sign this.

116
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,641
- Thank you. - Please sign the petition...

117
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:12,211
to oppose Brian's resignation.

118
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,450
We're signing a petition to oppose Brian's resignation.

119
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,081
Please sign it.

120
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,891
Please sign the petition to oppose Brian's resignation.

121
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,291
Please sign the petition.

122
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,120
Please sign the petition...

123
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
- to oppose Brian's resignation. - Please sign it.

124
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,760
Please sign the petition to oppose Brian's resignation.

125
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,430
Please sign the petition to oppose Brian's resignation.

126
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,700
We're going to make it look more simple and intuitive.

127
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,271
The current main page looks as if we prepared everything...

128
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,870
because we don't know what our users want.

129
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:42,481
But we're going to change it so that it clearly shows...

130
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:44,041
that we're aware of what they want.

131
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:47,050
First of all, there are way too many categories...

132
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,351
on the main tab.

133
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,791
We're going to delete two categories to make it look more simple.

134
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,151
You're starting with the most controversial issue.

135
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,721
You're going to discard two categories?

136
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,860
Even if there aren't many users, it'll affect our sales...

137
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,560
if categories get deleted from the main page.

138
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,630
We picked out the top three services that have the lowest users...

139
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,370
and sales profit.

140
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,541
And they turned out to be Games, Books, and My Homepage.

141
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,601
You're saying you want to get rid of two of them.

142
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,711
But wouldn't the people in those teams raise an issue?

143
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:14,940
They'll just have to bear with it.

144
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:18,180
We can't risk the regression of our main page because of that.

145
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,211
Times are changing very quickly.

146
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,981
A portal site shouldn't chase after change.

147
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:24,320
It should take the lead.

148
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:26,450
The market share is back to how it used to be.

149
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,820
And you want to change our image by reforming the main page?

150
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,930
I'm not quite sure. I don't know if making small changes...

151
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,260
will act as a solution.

152
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:38,200
Kevin, is there something you'd like to suggest instead?

153
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,401
What do you think the company wants? It wants an increase in sales.

154
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,070
What's the category that has the lowest sales?

155
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,541
My Homepage.

156
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:47,510
Then that should be the first one to get deleted.

157
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,380
Go ahead and proceed with what you have in mind.

158
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,310
Let's end the meeting here.

159
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,950
Kevin.

160
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,930
You should attend the TF Team's meetings.

161
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,560
I'd like you to make decisions right on the spot.

162
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,531
We need to reform the main page in just two weeks.

163
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,971
Having to report to you like this is inefficient and time-consuming.

164
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,310
I'm not Brian. I have my own methods.

165
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,541
I like how things are right now.

166
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,911
The doors are opening.

167
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,361
Who sent you?

168
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,700
You just delivered the photos.

169
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:26,871
I'm just a delivery guy.

170
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,011
I don't know anything.

171
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,611
You'd better answer me if you want to leave quietly.

172
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,220
My gosh, I love this music.

173
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,151
Will this company be in charge of our game's soundtrack?

174
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:42,391
Yes, we're going to contact them.

175
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,761
It's Millim Sound, the company that recently worked with Unicon.

176
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,230
Millim Sound? Park Morgan?

177
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:50,730
I don't like this song.

178
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,501
But you just said you like it.

179
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm saying I don't like him. I really don't like that guy.

180
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,310
- I like him. - Me too.

181
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,741
- Me too. - Me too.

182
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,011
All his works are amazing, and we all wish to work with him.

183
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,680
We should sign a deal before he becomes too popular.

184
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,281
Music should have...

185
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,580
- some class... - What's this?

186
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,891
We're going to be exempted from the main page?

187
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:13,350
They're going to delete two categories...

188
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,690
from Games, Books, and My Homepage.

189
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,621
- What? - What did you just say?

190
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,060
These jerks.

191
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:22,661
It's an educational lecture service we'll be working with.

192
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,161
They have a lot of popular instructors.

193
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,800
Listen to the marketing lectures. You'll learn a lot.

194
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,281
(The power of making the impossible possible)

195
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,980
(Wella)

196
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,151
My gosh, I didn't know this guy would be on here too.

197
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,861
I'm Charlie, Senior Manager of the Book Service Team.

198
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm Michelle, Senior Manager of the My Homepage Team.

199
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,491
- Gaming Department... - I know who you are.

200
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,401
I know why you're here.

201
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,470
The decision had to be made...

202
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,671
to simplify the main page.

203
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,141
It's to benefit Barro, so please be understanding.

204
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:39,310
What decided the cut?

205
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,611
Sales or number of users?

206
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,810
Both.

207
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,411
Then how can you cut the Gaming Department?

208
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,180
You know the amount we bring in.

209
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:50,980
No one clicks on the game tab...

210
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,891
to access the games.

211
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:54,090
Users type in the name in the search bar...

212
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,090
or click on the shortcut icon.

213
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:57,220
That's right.

214
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,361
Besides, mobile games are leading the market anyway.

215
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,200
The Gaming Department should be cut.

216
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,631
What are you talking about?

217
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:08,371
Ever since we lost the contract with the online library service,

218
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,241
the Book Service Team has been low on revenue.

219
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:12,070
Besides, who reads books in this day and age?

220
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,940
Information is just a click away.

221
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,440
Books are no longer a profitable medium anymore.

222
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,480
In this new era, we are now listening to books instead.

223
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,980
Books are past their time?

224
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,291
- Games must've fried your brains. - What?

225
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,220
Web portals have a standard to maintain.

226
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,521
Barro is a web portal used by everyone...

227
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,090
and it must serve the public interest.

228
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,460
Public interest, yes.

229
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,930
If money is all that's important, we should only post ads.

230
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:41,641
Why bother with other services?

231
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:42,940
My Homepage Team,

232
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,541
you don't even provide any kind of service.

233
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,810
Who uses My Homepage these days?

234
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:50,041
It's just a poor little diary.

235
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,050
Scarlett, did you hear that?

236
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,550
Our passion as youngsters is what fueled My Homepage,

237
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,320
and he just mocked us.

238
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,220
- Well... - Who made Barro what it is today?

239
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:02,361
There was a time when My Homepage was more famous than Barro.

240
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,291
It was Korea's first social networking service...

241
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,391
and it had up to 15 million users back in the day.

242
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,401
My Homepage is Barro's pride and its history.

243
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,001
One who forgets his history...

244
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,271
will never have a future.

245
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:21,580
So?

246
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:23,940
How many users do you have left?

247
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:27,381
Stop trying to revive a service that is already dead...

248
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:29,050
and let it rest in peace.

249
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,850
You fool! What did you just say?

250
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:34,590
- You fool? - Yes, you fool!

251
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,820
- Did you really just say that? - I did!

252
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,761
How barbaric. Della, Bianca?

253
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:42,161
You're both too primitive to have a proper discussion.

254
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,361
Then just get lost!

255
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,771
Why should we?

256
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,100
Matthew isn't wrong, you know.

257
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,241
My Homepage has been on the downfall.

258
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,401
- Hey. - Shut it!

259
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,710
Is that the best you can do?

260
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,570
- No wonder you're a mess. - What?

261
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,611
This is why My Homepage has been on the downfall.

262
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:58,710
What?

263
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:11,521
Someone must be constantly sponsoring you...

264
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,930
considering how poor the quality is.

265
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,531
Oh, these?

266
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,771
It's the apartment Mr. Oh often visits these days.

267
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:24,541
We tried very hard to get the woman's face,

268
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,771
but we couldn't.

269
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,950
Go ahead. Take one right now.

270
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,550
What?

271
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:45,861
- Oh, so it's you. - Who was it?

272
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,131
Who ordered these photos?

273
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,730
Ma'am, come on.

274
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,300
As you know,

275
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,001
this line of business is entirely based on trust.

276
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,011
Did you ever consider that you could die?

277
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,550
I guess you didn't.

278
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,991
How much is it that you want?

279
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,131
I thought two big ones should suffice.

280
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,230
I'll give you four, so keep following me around.

281
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:25,001
- Keep taking photos too. - Sorry?

282
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,411
Send the photos to this person.

283
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,011
(Managing Director Song Ga Gyeong, 37-30 Sampyeong-dong, Bundang-gu)

284
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:43,480
Isn't this your wife?

285
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,320
Why are you sending her these?

286
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,720
Because they make good evidence.

287
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:51,291
What do you mean?

288
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,590
The more, the better, right?

289
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,241
It's a place that was empty for a long time.

290
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,641
Other than me and the cleaner,

291
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,151
you're the first visitor.

292
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,651
The passcode is your birthday.

293
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,121
The more, the better, right?

294
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,361
What has he been planning?

295
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,001
Tomorrow at noon, 77 Eonju-ro.

296
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,171
Be at the table if you wish to negotiate.

297
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:49,502
It's soy sauce.

298
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:52,102
Isn't it good? What do you think?

299
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:56,703
The sausages look great.

300
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:59,243
- Wait, hold on. - Are you kidding me?

301
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:01,042
- Seriously? - Sorry.

302
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:05,713
Looking good.

303
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:10,582
Morgan, there's a photo of a woman in here.

304
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:13,653
Who is she?

305
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:14,792
Is she your girlfriend?

306
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:16,792
Just eat, you punk.

307
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:19,963
He's in a relationship, so you should just dig in.

308
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,633
You're seeing someone?

309
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,203
But we've all been busy. When did it happen?

310
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:26,203
Being busy can never be an excuse.

311
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:28,703
You just have to be brutal, don't you?

312
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:31,143
Let's drink then.

313
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:34,772
Look at us having a company outing. We've sure come a long way.

314
00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:38,552
You worked hard as well, Morgan.

315
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:40,552
- You too, guys. - Sure.

316
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,883
- Cheers! - Cheers!

317
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:47,923
Forget about the hard work though.

318
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,762
I'm just happy we produced great music.

319
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:52,862
That's right. Once the game is launched,

320
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,332
we'll get so many project offers.

321
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:55,802
We already have one.

322
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:57,832
What?

323
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:00,703
We already have a new gig.

324
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:02,943
Be back at the office next week.

325
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,373
Next week?

326
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:09,143
- You took the job from Barro? - Yes.

327
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:12,852
Seon Woo, you'll start on the sketches tomorrow.

328
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:14,782
(Beyer No.77)

329
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:28,262
- I have one more round left. - What do I do?

330
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:31,403
Do I text him or not?

331
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,903
Wait. Haven't you texted him?

332
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,743
Go ahead. Nothing will happen unless you take action.

333
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:40,643
What should I say?

334
00:18:41,782 --> 00:18:44,842
"Hello" is lame, isn't it?

335
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,413
"Did you get home safely? It was nice meeting you."

336
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:48,483
Things like that.

337
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:49,582
It's not difficult, you know.

338
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:50,653
Do you know...

339
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:53,022
how far my imagination ran after our reunion?

340
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:56,322
I imagined us getting married...

341
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,963
and even having a kid!

342
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:01,903
Gosh, I'm so lame.

343
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:04,733
You're adorable.

344
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,973
You went from mentor to child in a matter of seconds.

345
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:10,173
I wish you the best.

346
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:14,243
If things work out, it means that you'll end up with your first love.

347
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:21,822
I have something to apologize to you about.

348
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,623
Remember the earrings you let me borrow?

349
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:28,822
I lost one of them.

350
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:32,292
I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find it.

351
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:35,862
This is bad.

352
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:37,963
I'm so sorry.

353
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:41,502
I went back to the pub...

354
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:43,542
and searched every corner of my house,

355
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:45,373
but I couldn't find it.

356
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:48,373
It's okay. I must've fastened it too loosely.

357
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:51,852
Won't you send the text message?

358
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,993
- It's an emotional scene. - Okay.

359
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,062
Let's rehearse it first.

360
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,592
Let's run a rehearsal with Gi Tae and Min Hyuk.

361
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,502
Must we do that?

362
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:11,602
I've been around too long to rehearse with this nobody.

363
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,703
Please help me out, sir.

364
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:18,512
Forget it. Have him practice with someone else.

365
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:21,342
Also, I'm not ready to shoot this scene yet.

366
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:22,612
Let's shoot the later scenes first.

367
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,683
If we do this first, my emotions will get all messed up.

368
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,713
Aren't you going to consider my emotions?

369
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:29,522
Can't you work out a decent shooting schedule yet?

370
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:33,252
What got into him?

371
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:37,562
I don't mind. Shoot the other scenes first.

372
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:38,762
I'll wait.

373
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,963
It's an important scene and might take a while.

374
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:42,733
Darn him.

375
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,532
- Sorry, Ji Hwan. - It's okay.

376
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,933
Prepare for the next scene.

377
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:05,693
What was that situation I just saw?

378
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:07,723
Oh, that was...

379
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:11,623
It was nothing. You don't need to get angry.

380
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:14,193
How dare he...

381
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:17,562
How can I not be angry after what I saw?

382
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,832
Who does he think he is? Are you two close?

383
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:22,302
Is he a psycho?

384
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,842
I'm in more scenes than before...

385
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,473
and getting noticed.

386
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:29,743
As the male lead, he's not very pleased.

387
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,453
I get that he might not be pleased,

388
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:35,282
but why turn it into an attitude?

389
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:39,153
How dare he whine and pout when he's at work?

390
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:42,562
Does he bother you in other ways? Like, hit you...

391
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:43,893
He doesn't.

392
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:47,663
Too bad. If he hit you, I could hit him back.

393
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:52,032
I'll help you rehearse. Give me your script.

394
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,243
Where do I start?

395
00:21:55,502 --> 00:21:56,903
Here, at the flashback.

396
00:21:58,173 --> 00:22:00,572
"Flashback from before Min Hyuk's death. Gi Tae."

397
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:01,913
Read from there.

398
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:06,282
That's why you're Min Hyuk, not Min Jae.

399
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,183
I'll start then.

400
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,022
"The mother-in-law you're hitting on."

401
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:19,133
"Min Sook. Doesn't she seem familiar?"

402
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:21,693
"Darn you. Hey."

403
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:25,102
"I told you not to talk to me. Get lost."

404
00:22:25,272 --> 00:22:28,532
"Min Sook is your dead wife's mother."

405
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:30,842
"Your previous mother-in-law."

406
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:35,943
"Hey. If Min Sook is my mother-in-law,"

407
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:38,213
"then I'm your father, you jerk."

408
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:40,752
"You don't have to believe me."

409
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:44,282
"So stay away from Min Sook."

410
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:46,352
"You and she aren't meant to be."

411
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:49,362
"You little bug. I told you to shut your mouth."

412
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:52,633
"Don't talk such nonsense or I'll kill you."

413
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,643
Sorry. That was too harsh, wasn't it?

414
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:07,312
You must be upset. Sorry.

415
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:12,383
Are you okay?

416
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:15,423
You're the wrong practice partner. Forget about this.

417
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:22,062
No, it's just that you're so good.

418
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:24,562
I already knew that, but still.

419
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:28,493
As you know, Min Hyuk's lines are usually like that.

420
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,433
While Min Jae's lines are sweet.

421
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:33,903
For example?

422
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,602
"The day we held hands."

423
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:42,282
"I hesitated a hundred times before doing it."

424
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:46,582
"This confession, I hesitated a thousand times."

425
00:23:47,612 --> 00:23:49,483
"I think I like you."

426
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:04,463
My actor's really good.

427
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:09,342
That clutch. It's nice.

428
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:10,743
What brand is it?

429
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:13,042
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

430
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:16,913
Because I thought it was nice.

431
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:26,393
Ji Hwan.

432
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:29,923
You keep forgetting that I'm your fan.

433
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:33,663
Don't do this to your fan.

434
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:36,903
Fans get confused when a celebrity does that.

435
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:38,802
Are you a fan?

436
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,683
I don't know who's the one getting confused.

437
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,963
You're late. Come and sit down.

438
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,602
Welcome, Ms. Daughter-in-law.

439
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:17,743
We're almost sick and tired of waiting for you.

440
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,413
Sit down.

441
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:26,282
You held a press conference as if you represent Unicon.

442
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:30,183
You're practically the face of Unicon.

443
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:32,893
I finally got to eat with you.

444
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:35,292
I can rest assured now. I feel so much at ease.

445
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:39,733
My daughter-in-law is smart and good at what she does.

446
00:25:39,762 --> 00:25:43,633
I had bad luck with my husband, but was blessed with her instead.

447
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:46,102
When she becomes CEO of Unicon,

448
00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:48,802
you all have to serve her well.

449
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,102
Butter her up.

450
00:25:50,443 --> 00:25:52,342
She'll become CEO soon?

451
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,312
She has to. I'll see to it.

452
00:25:56,643 --> 00:25:59,082
My daughter-in-law is great at what she does.

453
00:26:06,153 --> 00:26:07,693
You've rebelled enough...

454
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,423
for a woman in her 40s.

455
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:12,933
You made an old woman dance to your tune.

456
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,463
Pretend to give in.

457
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:24,302
I won't give in.

458
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:27,112
I told you clearly that I'll get a divorce.

459
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:32,453
You won't be CEO?

460
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:34,983
I said I'll make you one.

461
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:37,282
It's not up to you.

462
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,292
The US headquarters and board elects the CEO.

463
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:41,923
Do you think I can't manipulate the board?

464
00:26:41,923 --> 00:26:43,822
Will the headquarters just let you?

465
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:49,233
This is not a time to show force.

466
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:51,633
I'm the one who holds the key.

467
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:55,542
How dare you call me here after all the dirty things you made me do?

468
00:26:56,443 --> 00:26:58,842
The negotiation plan you must bring...

469
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:01,173
should state how much you'll give me...

470
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,112
and how the assets will be divided...

471
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:05,413
in return for my destroying all the evidence I have.

472
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:07,582
That's it.

473
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:09,752
That's a negotiation.

474
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:13,322
Did you think I would negotiate with you?

475
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:16,163
We lived as a family for 10 years.

476
00:27:16,322 --> 00:27:18,693
I'm saddened that you know me so little.

477
00:27:20,032 --> 00:27:24,102
Seeing that this is how you act, I really want to do it.

478
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:25,832
Show my force.

479
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:29,373
It was about others until now.

480
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:35,143
Experience it for yourself what happens...

481
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:38,042
when my force is aimed at you.

482
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:43,852
I'm hurt, Ga Gyeong.

483
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:46,852
I liked you so much.

484
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:00,873
He's so handsome.

485
00:28:02,903 --> 00:28:04,403
What are you all doing?

486
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:07,243
Was it usually this crowded at this time of day?

487
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,112
Would you like some tea?

488
00:28:09,582 --> 00:28:11,743
If you have a sweet tooth, we have cookies too.

489
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:13,953
No, it's fine. Thank you.

490
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,552
You probably maintain a strict diet.

491
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,993
- Welcome to Barro. - Welcome.

492
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:22,663
Hey, Hannah, Bella, Bianca.

493
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:25,423
We're at work. Shall we return to our seats?

494
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:26,733
Let's go.

495
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:38,542
Put more effort into your equipment instead of your looks.

496
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:41,473
The sound quality was terrible.

497
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:44,042
It's because it's a demo. Listen to the actual release.

498
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:51,582
You seem to think life is easy because you trust your looks.

499
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:53,592
It only lasts a while.

500
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:57,022
Do you know that? It means nothing when you're older.

501
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,163
I was pretty in my youth, so I know.

502
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,733
You're still pretty.

503
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:05,633
What?

504
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:07,272
That was too informal.

505
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:11,272
Hey. Are you teasing...

506
00:29:13,373 --> 00:29:14,473
me right now?

507
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:19,153
Is this how you work?

508
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:20,983
Are you a gold-digger?

509
00:29:21,153 --> 00:29:22,883
Does Tammy know you are a gold-digger?

510
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:28,893
When you were younger, were you a better person?

511
00:29:29,993 --> 00:29:31,923
What did you mean by that?

512
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:34,592
We already started work on the project.

513
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:37,502
You'll get your demo in about two weeks.

514
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,873
Give me your feedback. I hope we get along in the future.

515
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:52,012
I'm near your office.

516
00:29:52,342 --> 00:29:53,453
I'll be at a cafe.

517
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:54,883
Come see me for a second.

518
00:29:58,223 --> 00:30:00,792
- Hello. - Hi.

519
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:02,723
What brings you here?

520
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:08,163
Did Tammy ask you to come visit her while she's at work?

521
00:30:08,163 --> 00:30:11,062
No, I signed a deal with Barro.

522
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:13,002
Really?

523
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:15,373
- Does Tammy know? - Not yet.

524
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:17,203
Please keep it a secret.

525
00:30:18,502 --> 00:30:19,673
Okay, sure.

526
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:22,542
Bye, then.

527
00:30:25,443 --> 00:30:26,512
Oh, right.

528
00:30:29,082 --> 00:30:30,483
I heard you went to a reunion.

529
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:32,623
Plus, I heard you even went to a coed school.

530
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:36,993
I'm not sure if you know, but she really hated that you went.

531
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:41,062
She really hated it.

532
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:51,602
Why is he asking me to come outside? I'm so busy.

533
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:53,143
He must think I have so much time.

534
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:06,393
Why are you here?

535
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,463
Did you have a meeting nearby?

536
00:31:14,562 --> 00:31:17,262
- Don't you have something to say? - You're the one who called me out.

537
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:18,562
You should be the one talking.

538
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:20,233
I heard you didn't like that I went to the reunion.

539
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:26,272
- Who... Who told you that? - Who do you think?

540
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:28,842
I heard it from the person who saw you being jealous.

541
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:33,012
Hyeon...

542
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:37,423
Why would you get jealous in front of someone else and not me?

543
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:38,852
Are you nitpicking right now?

544
00:31:38,852 --> 00:31:40,022
No, I'm angry at you.

545
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,493
- Why? - Why do you think?

546
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:43,762
You're dating me, but you got jealous in front of someone else.

547
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:45,493
Why can't I see you get jealous?

548
00:31:45,592 --> 00:31:47,933
I'm the only one who deserves to see that.

549
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:49,502
It's just wrong. Don't you agree?

550
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:50,703
What?

551
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,502
- Show me. - Show you what?

552
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:56,802
I want you to get jealous in front of me.

553
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:59,002
You got jealous because I went to a reunion where there were girls.

554
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,913
Hey, do you know that you're really weird sometimes?

555
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:03,012
You're weirder.

556
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:05,953
Isn't it weird you got jealous in front of your colleague, not me?

557
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:08,983
Are you going to do it or not?

558
00:32:09,582 --> 00:32:11,522
Do what? Get jealous?

559
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:12,792
Here?

560
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:14,522
Are you asking me to reenact the moment?

561
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:15,792
Why can't you?

562
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,893
You're still upset that I went to the reunion.

563
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:19,663
So show me how you really feel.

564
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,362
Will you stop talking nonsense?

565
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:22,703
Why would you ask me to get jealous?

566
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,832
Forget it, then.

567
00:32:25,262 --> 00:32:26,532
I wasn't even asking for much.

568
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:28,473
You're making me sad.

569
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:31,473
I'll be off now.

570
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:33,312
You're really leaving?

571
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:38,542
What...

572
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:41,683
He's just going to leave?

573
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:49,052
Hyeon, you told him, didn't you?

574
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:51,262
What are you talking about, Tammy?

575
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,663
You told Morgan I was upset that he went to the reunion.

576
00:32:55,393 --> 00:32:56,663
He's unbelievable.

577
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,673
I can't believe he told you that already.

578
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:02,532
- Where did you meet him? - At...

579
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:06,643
I ran into him near the company building.

580
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:10,243
Why would he get upset about this...

581
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:11,413
when he's the one who made a mistake?

582
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:15,413
Do you really need to talk about this kind of stuff at work?

583
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:18,052
Who are you to talk? You even went out with a colleague.

584
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:21,023
Why would you mention Pyo Joon Soo right now?

585
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,623
I'm not the only one who dated him.

586
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:24,523
Why would you bring that up?

587
00:33:28,063 --> 00:33:29,333
We should take the game category...

588
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:31,802
out of the main page, right?

589
00:33:32,732 --> 00:33:33,873
Yes, we should.

590
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:35,902
Right.

591
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:39,612
I have a question.

592
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:42,413
What did I exactly say when I was angry...

593
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:44,282
that Morgan went to the reunion?

594
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:48,112
You said you couldn't understand why he'd ask if he could go...

595
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:50,482
and that he shouldn't have gone.

596
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:53,623
"Why would he ask me if he can attend the reunion?"

597
00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:54,953
"He should know better not to go."

598
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:57,623
- Is that how I said it? - No.

599
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:00,333
You looked a bit cuter than that.

600
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:01,933
Your eyes were so big.

601
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:03,762
- My eyes? - Yes.

602
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:06,873
Like this?

603
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:10,543
That looks cute too.

604
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:12,342
But it wasn't quite like that.

605
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:16,012
You're cute in a different way when you're drunk.

606
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:19,652
Why do you keep saying I'm cute?

607
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:22,253
Then stop being so cute.

608
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:25,282
My gosh, you little...

609
00:35:25,382 --> 00:35:26,512
Oh no.

610
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:33,353
You should watch where you're walking.

611
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:34,652
What are you going to do about this?

612
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:36,762
I'm sorry.

613
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:39,462
I need to hand it in right now, but how am I going to do that?

614
00:35:39,592 --> 00:35:40,692
My gosh.

615
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:43,933
But was it really my fault?

616
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:47,172
You wouldn't have dropped it if you had been more careful.

617
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:49,703
You wouldn't have stepped on it if you had been more careful.

618
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:53,212
Hey, what's your problem?

619
00:35:56,683 --> 00:36:00,583
Why are you taking it out on her when you're the one who dropped it?

620
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,512
Look at how bad your painting is.

621
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:04,183
I guess you're here to slack off.

622
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:06,822
You shouldn't even call this a painting.

623
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:09,023
What? What did you just say?

624
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:10,663
Let's go, Ga Gyeong.

625
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:32,083
It was nice seeing you.

626
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:38,853
(Assemblyman Kwon Chang Hyuk)

627
00:36:40,393 --> 00:36:42,962
Hello, sir. It's been a while.

628
00:36:44,462 --> 00:36:46,262
Yes, of course. I'm doing fine.

629
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,663
Your nephew is doing very well.

630
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:52,203
He's very competent.

631
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:59,373
We're just grateful to work with such great talent.

632
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,612
You met Chairwoman Jang?

633
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:11,723
Ms. Song is going to become what?

634
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,072
I was surprised to hear from you.

635
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:30,873
I didn't think you'd call me today.

636
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:32,973
I want you to hold Ga Gyeong down.

637
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:36,842
This is interesting.

638
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:40,583
Every time you do this, it really gets me thinking.

639
00:37:42,822 --> 00:37:44,583
I heard you're going to appoint Ga Gyeong as the CEO.

640
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:46,853
But you want me to hold her down?

641
00:37:47,393 --> 00:37:48,692
I want an explanation.

642
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:54,333
Ga Gyeong wants a divorce.

643
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:56,163
But I'm not going to give her what she wants.

644
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:58,232
That's why I want you to hold her down.

645
00:37:59,462 --> 00:38:01,433
If Ga Gyeong doesn't get a divorce,

646
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:05,143
you'll get rid of me and hand her the CEO position.

647
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:09,212
So I should support her in order to keep my place.

648
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:12,583
What's your intention behind telling me this?

649
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:16,953
What do you think will happen if she gets a divorce?

650
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,523
She'll no longer have the support of KU Group.

651
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:23,063
What do ex-daughters-in-law of rich families...

652
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:24,723
end up desiring the most?

653
00:38:25,393 --> 00:38:26,563
Power.

654
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,333
They want power to protect themselves...

655
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:30,603
because they don't know when they might get attacked.

656
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,003
You don't seem to get it.

657
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:34,902
Let me cut to the chase.

658
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:39,203
If she doesn't get a divorce, I'm going to appoint her as the CEO.

659
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:41,172
But if she does get a divorce,

660
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:44,243
Ga Gyeong will become the CEO on her own.

661
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:47,813
Do you need a better reason to hold her down?

662
00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:57,123
Today's the morning of the big day.

663
00:38:57,663 --> 00:38:58,893
As we discussed yesterday,

664
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,862
talk to each team and come to an agreement.

665
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,262
Each team will have their own opinions.

666
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:04,703
But the most important thing...

667
00:39:04,902 --> 00:39:07,473
is how Barro will be perceived through the main page.

668
00:39:08,003 --> 00:39:09,132
Please don't forget that.

669
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:10,873
Scarlett, take the Branding Department.

670
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:12,503
Joseph and Jenny, you guys take the News Team.

671
00:39:12,503 --> 00:39:13,813
Ellie and Alex, take the Advertising Team.

672
00:39:13,942 --> 00:39:15,572
I'll go talk to Kevin.

673
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:19,482
Can't you tell the difference between this orange and this one?

674
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:21,183
They're obviously different.

675
00:39:21,382 --> 00:39:22,913
It's so obvious.

676
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,282
They're completely different.

677
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:28,453
How are they different?

678
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:34,692
Can't you just change the color?

679
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:36,232
Who's going to notice the difference?

680
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:38,902
Do you know how many people watch the live baseball stream?

681
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:42,833
We compete with Unicon like crazy to increase the number of viewers.

682
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:43,973
But look here.

683
00:39:43,973 --> 00:39:46,243
How many baseball games do we have a day? Five.

684
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:48,743
But look at the space for the scoreboards.

685
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:50,612
Is it enough for five lines?

686
00:39:50,882 --> 00:39:53,982
Unicon provides all five of them at one glance.

687
00:39:54,052 --> 00:39:56,982
If we don't do the same, we'll lose the competition.

688
00:39:56,982 --> 00:39:58,552
But if we let you have more space,

689
00:39:58,552 --> 00:40:01,123
there won't be enough for the sub-categories.

690
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:03,262
That's not what's important right now.

691
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:05,163
Baseball is key!

692
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:08,362
Baseball isn't life. Life is baseball for us.

693
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:09,393
Look here.

694
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,603
This is the current screen, and this is the revised one.

695
00:40:17,043 --> 00:40:18,402
You want to push the ads down?

696
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,512
- Wait, David. - David!

697
00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:23,942
Pushing the ads down will cost us severely.

698
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:25,212
You know that, Alex.

699
00:40:25,212 --> 00:40:27,652
Yes, of course. But the direction of the new main page...

700
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:29,183
Are we starting a charity?

701
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:31,782
Advertisements bring in the money. It's our cash cow.

702
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:34,453
Its space is sacred and shouldn't be touched.

703
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:35,723
Just get out.

704
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:41,132
I'm done with this new main page.

705
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:46,333
Scarlett, you seem angry too.

706
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,833
It's why you're treating your skin.

707
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:52,442
I never imagined that changing the main page...

708
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:53,743
would be this difficult.

709
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:57,083
It's my third time, and I want to resign yet again.

710
00:40:57,612 --> 00:40:58,813
I'd rather just die.

711
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:00,453
When I was in charge of the Marketing Team,

712
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:01,753
I butted heads with the Revision Team.

713
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:03,253
I'm in their shoes for the first time.

714
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:05,123
What goes around comes around.

715
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:08,922
So how do you think Tammy is doing?

716
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:13,833
She's probably taking on our biggest foe.

717
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:19,003
That's the so-called front line.

718
00:41:28,543 --> 00:41:30,413
- No. - I won't take no for an answer.

719
00:41:30,413 --> 00:41:31,913
- Tammy. - Kevin.

720
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:33,953
Like I said, web portals...

721
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:37,623
They must give back to society and be of public service.

722
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:39,893
I'm not saying we should get rid of the Donation tab.

723
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:42,692
How can it stand out if we don't deliberately expose it?

724
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:45,762
Our users can't know if we're doing good or not.

725
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:48,032
As you said, Barro is a company.

726
00:41:48,232 --> 00:41:50,802
We need to advertise that we're giving back to society.

727
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:52,132
The main page...

728
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:55,172
is our best platform to generate sales.

729
00:41:55,773 --> 00:41:56,902
Donations?

730
00:41:57,072 --> 00:41:59,672
Barro's image? It's all good, so keep it up.

731
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:03,342
Before any social contribution,

732
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:07,453
I'd rather generate more sales and make sure all our employees...

733
00:42:07,453 --> 00:42:09,112
get to keep their contracts.

734
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:12,123
That's not a good enough reason...

735
00:42:12,123 --> 00:42:14,023
since Barro already makes enough money.

736
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,962
You want to prove yourself with numbers.

737
00:42:23,232 --> 00:42:25,333
You want to prove that Barro can function...

738
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:27,132
without Brian.

739
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:30,703
Is that wrong?

740
00:42:35,473 --> 00:42:36,482
Of course not.

741
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:40,552
However, you'll have to personally persuade every employee against you.

742
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:43,552
Barro's direction won't change because...

743
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:45,052
we had a change in leadership.

744
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:47,623
Barro has always been going...

745
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:50,493
in the right and proper direction.

746
00:42:50,523 --> 00:42:51,993
"The right direction" can mean...

747
00:42:52,663 --> 00:42:54,862
something entirely different.

748
00:42:55,962 --> 00:42:58,103
If you wish to have the Donation tab exposed,

749
00:42:58,563 --> 00:43:00,273
then make space for more ads.

750
00:43:10,712 --> 00:43:12,683
We will now begin the disciplinary hearing.

751
00:43:14,482 --> 00:43:17,052
On June 28, without the board's approval,

752
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:19,753
Managing Director Song...

753
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:21,822
held a press conference by herself.

754
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:25,023
She brought chaos to the company internally...

755
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:27,592
and revealed trade secrets...

756
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:29,692
and internal regulations to the public.

757
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,003
We find Ms. Song...

758
00:43:32,003 --> 00:43:34,703
in violation of Article 11 of the Unicon Company Regulation...

759
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:37,802
and Article 15 which states her misconduct.

760
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:41,373
The violations are enough to relieve her of her position.

761
00:43:41,942 --> 00:43:43,813
However, due to its positive outcome,

762
00:43:43,813 --> 00:43:46,813
we will only place her with a two-month suspension.

763
00:44:09,572 --> 00:44:12,172
Shouldn't you still be at work?

764
00:44:18,442 --> 00:44:19,482
What are you doing?

765
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:21,253
I'm...

766
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:23,322
making dinner.

767
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,052
You know how to cook?

768
00:44:31,322 --> 00:44:33,592
I lived alone when I was in New York...

769
00:44:33,692 --> 00:44:35,933
and I barely had enough money to get by.

770
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,262
My mother cut me off when I went to film school.

771
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:42,532
I had to work two part-time jobs.

772
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:45,603
Maybe I should get one of those.

773
00:44:46,873 --> 00:44:48,712
I'll be out of a job for a while.

774
00:44:50,712 --> 00:44:52,913
The press conference was probably presented as the cause.

775
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,453
Still, it doesn't sound like you were fired.

776
00:44:57,953 --> 00:45:00,623
My mother must really be fond of you.

777
00:45:01,152 --> 00:45:04,223
She keeps giving you second chances when we'll be divorcing anyway.

778
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:07,393
I received some photos.

779
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,833
They were of the two of us.

780
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:17,072
I also found out who sent me those photos.

781
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:21,212
You worried about my outcome from this divorce before I did...

782
00:45:22,942 --> 00:45:24,342
and I'm grateful.

783
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:28,183
- We should eat first. - Just so you know,

784
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:31,623
those photos...

785
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:35,322
hurt me sometimes.

786
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:38,922
We want nothing from each other,

787
00:45:39,192 --> 00:45:41,192
we have no right to get upset about it,

788
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,132
and we're no regular couple,

789
00:45:46,302 --> 00:45:47,873
but sometimes it felt like...

790
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:50,243
I was truly alone in this world.

791
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,373
Something like that.

792
00:45:54,112 --> 00:45:56,143
I sometimes think like that too.

793
00:45:57,683 --> 00:45:59,583
In order for you to not be alone,

794
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:01,712
you have to be alone first.

795
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:05,183
I apologize for the cruel approach.

796
00:46:05,183 --> 00:46:07,893
Actually, I apologize for...

797
00:46:08,293 --> 00:46:11,563
not being a decent person over the past 10 years.

798
00:46:11,922 --> 00:46:13,262
I promise you this though.

799
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:16,433
I'll get you your divorce no matter what.

800
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:20,003
I haven't done anything for you in my life,

801
00:46:20,172 --> 00:46:22,103
but that I'll make happen.

802
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:28,773
So what's that?

803
00:46:35,913 --> 00:46:38,083
Today's our wedding anniversary.

804
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:42,353
I thought it'd be our last, so I bought you flowers for once.

805
00:46:44,723 --> 00:46:46,962
Why did you buy so many though?

806
00:46:48,293 --> 00:46:49,762
So it'll be hard to throw out.

807
00:46:50,462 --> 00:46:51,802
Let's eat.

808
00:46:56,802 --> 00:46:58,802
Related to what we discussed earlier...

809
00:46:58,802 --> 00:47:02,942
we will now go back to discussing the methodology once more.

810
00:47:07,552 --> 00:47:10,382
First, let's talk about phenomenons.

811
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:13,282
It's important to observe...

812
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:15,493
and perceive such things.

813
00:47:15,493 --> 00:47:18,223
What can we say these phenomenons are then?

814
00:47:18,822 --> 00:47:20,262
Data, right?

815
00:47:20,493 --> 00:47:22,563
Every day, data is collected...

816
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:26,232
and accumulated. So all that massive data...

817
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:28,402
We should go out if you're done with your classes.

818
00:47:28,703 --> 00:47:30,103
I told you we should meet outside.

819
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:33,973
Actually, I feel more comfortable here.

820
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:37,512
I don't like you spending money on me either.

821
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,282
Being indoors won't stop that.

822
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:44,882
Here you go, Mom.

823
00:47:46,953 --> 00:47:49,592
I said I wouldn't accept it until you earn more than I do.

824
00:47:50,362 --> 00:47:53,793
We might have to compare because I just got paid.

825
00:47:53,993 --> 00:47:56,232
Businesses can fall at any second.

826
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:58,663
Do you have a savings account?

827
00:47:58,732 --> 00:47:59,762
Don't worry.

828
00:48:00,402 --> 00:48:01,703
My business will only thrive.

829
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,842
Then this is your allowance from me.

830
00:48:15,052 --> 00:48:16,253
Seriously?

831
00:48:17,183 --> 00:48:19,052
Receiving an allowance at this age...

832
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,023
Well, it feels great.

833
00:48:24,493 --> 00:48:25,592
I like how thick it is.

834
00:48:25,993 --> 00:48:27,163
Don't spend it all at once.

835
00:48:27,692 --> 00:48:28,732
Sure thing.

836
00:48:31,132 --> 00:48:34,603
Professor, the dean would like a word with you.

837
00:48:34,603 --> 00:48:36,503
- About five minutes should do. - All right.

838
00:48:37,842 --> 00:48:39,043
- I'll be back in five. - Sure.

839
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,023
(Son)

840
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:22,652
(Bae Ta Mi)

841
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:45,402
Why did you ask if you can go to the reunion?

842
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:46,873
Of course, you shouldn't have gone.

843
00:49:46,873 --> 00:49:49,143
Just because I told you to go, did you really have to go?

844
00:49:49,143 --> 00:49:51,212
Why go to a reunion where there will be women...

845
00:49:51,212 --> 00:49:52,313
when you have a girlfriend?

846
00:49:52,313 --> 00:49:53,882
You don't look handsome just to me.

847
00:49:53,882 --> 00:49:55,453
Other women think so too.

848
00:49:55,552 --> 00:49:56,813
You know that.

849
00:49:56,922 --> 00:49:58,482
You know you're handsome.

850
00:49:58,652 --> 00:50:00,922
How can you go there when you're aware of that fact?

851
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:02,993
Do you think I was cool with it because I acted cool?

852
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:04,422
I'm not cool with it at all.

853
00:50:04,422 --> 00:50:07,293
The moment you told me, my fury reached maximum level...

854
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:09,192
that I almost blew up the earth, okay?

855
00:50:09,462 --> 00:50:11,862
Be grateful you're still standing on it.

856
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:20,572
That was a rehearsal. I'll go again.

857
00:50:21,342 --> 00:50:23,043
What am I doing?

858
00:50:26,012 --> 00:50:27,453
I want to stay the night.

859
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,152
No. Go home.

860
00:50:34,092 --> 00:50:36,023
Enacting that brought back the emotions.

861
00:50:36,692 --> 00:50:38,223
I don't want to be around you.

862
00:50:38,822 --> 00:50:41,793
I don't want to be around a guy who met his female classmates.

863
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:42,962
Don't you get that?

864
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:49,503
Say yes. Let me stay with you.

865
00:50:50,973 --> 00:50:52,043
This is unbelievable.

866
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:53,873
You're being a fuss.

867
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:55,873
Get off me.

868
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:01,413
I clearly said I don't want to be around you.

869
00:51:02,552 --> 00:51:05,183
One, two...

870
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:12,192
I'll kill you if you go to another reunion.

871
00:51:13,623 --> 00:51:14,762
A reunion?

872
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:16,762
What's that?

873
00:51:17,962 --> 00:51:19,163
You don't need to know.

874
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:21,632
Never find out forever.

875
00:51:22,203 --> 00:51:24,103
Such events should be abolished.

876
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:28,612
Connections made in school are the ones I hate the most.

877
00:51:30,012 --> 00:51:31,583
They should disappear.

878
00:51:42,592 --> 00:51:44,922
Just look at that sweet face.

879
00:51:45,163 --> 00:51:46,163
It got so much fun...

880
00:51:46,163 --> 00:51:48,563
- since he returned as a twin. - That's right.

881
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:50,802
I watch this just to see Min Hyuk.

882
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:53,302
Me too. I want him to marry my daughter.

883
00:51:54,003 --> 00:51:55,773
I don't have a daughter.

884
00:51:56,373 --> 00:51:59,473
- If only I were 20 years younger. - Oh, come on.

885
00:52:01,512 --> 00:52:02,643
Look at that.

886
00:52:03,112 --> 00:52:04,282
My goodness.

887
00:52:07,612 --> 00:52:11,552
("What's Wrong with My Mother-In-Law?" ratings)

888
00:52:11,552 --> 00:52:12,652
Let's see.

889
00:52:12,652 --> 00:52:14,893
("What's Wrong with My Mother-In-Law?")

890
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:17,493
Really? It's over 20 percent?

891
00:52:21,732 --> 00:52:24,402
Master actor Seol Ji Hwan who's starring in a hit drama,

892
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,603
congratulations on going beyond the 20-percent rating.

893
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:46,982
Why did I eat so much?

894
00:52:58,132 --> 00:53:00,262
Why won't he reply?

895
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:02,773
Is he that popular now?

896
00:53:09,012 --> 00:53:10,212
I'll take this.

897
00:53:10,342 --> 00:53:11,942
Wrap it nicely for me.

898
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:14,012
- I'll get you a new one. - Okay.

899
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:21,152
I didn't see the text.

900
00:53:21,152 --> 00:53:22,422
I was about to call you.

901
00:53:23,192 --> 00:53:24,322
I have good news.

902
00:53:24,322 --> 00:53:26,462
Are you free?

903
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:32,563
Why... This is...

904
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:35,203
the same as yours.

905
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:36,933
You said it was pretty.

906
00:53:39,203 --> 00:53:41,572
Can I really accept this?

907
00:53:44,112 --> 00:53:45,442
What's the present for?

908
00:53:48,253 --> 00:53:50,083
I have a real manager.

909
00:53:52,152 --> 00:53:53,523
You signed with an agency?

910
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:57,123
Where? What other actors do they represent?

911
00:53:58,293 --> 00:54:00,762
I signed with the agency that represents Hyun Bin.

912
00:54:02,092 --> 00:54:03,262
Really?

913
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:05,933
Oh, wow, that's great.

914
00:54:06,232 --> 00:54:09,072
Anyone with eyes would recognize my actor.

915
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:10,672
Congratulations.

916
00:54:12,072 --> 00:54:15,873
You're the one who deserves a present...

917
00:54:15,973 --> 00:54:17,143
and I got one.

918
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:19,382
You went through a lot for me.

919
00:54:20,012 --> 00:54:23,112
Thanks to you, I signed with a great company.

920
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:24,822
Thank you.

921
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:32,793
I'm a fan who got a present from a celebrity.

922
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:36,262
Thank you.

923
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:39,732
A fan?

924
00:54:47,672 --> 00:54:52,043
From now on, I'll act like a fan should.

925
00:54:53,683 --> 00:54:55,282
Sorry if I confused you.

926
00:54:58,953 --> 00:55:00,422
As a fan,

927
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:04,493
being able to do this with a celebrity they like...

928
00:55:05,462 --> 00:55:06,762
is quite exciting.

929
00:55:10,362 --> 00:55:11,462
Right.

930
00:55:13,862 --> 00:55:16,203
Where do you shoot now? You aren't late, are you?

931
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:17,802
I'll drive you.

932
00:55:19,503 --> 00:55:20,643
Ji Hwan, over here.

933
00:55:22,813 --> 00:55:24,683
You have a car already.

934
00:55:26,842 --> 00:55:28,253
Your company made quite a fuss.

935
00:55:28,712 --> 00:55:30,853
They got me the car yesterday.

936
00:55:33,353 --> 00:55:35,453
I'm all for that fuss.

937
00:55:36,192 --> 00:55:37,793
Now I can relax.

938
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:41,833
Good luck with the shoot.

939
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:44,103
Thanks. See you.

940
00:56:07,422 --> 00:56:08,953
Now I can be...

941
00:56:10,762 --> 00:56:11,922
just a real fan.

942
00:56:22,408 --> 00:56:24,479
The parents who raised me are Australian.

943
00:56:25,379 --> 00:56:27,348
They were working at the Australian embassy...

944
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:29,048
when they adopted me.

945
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:32,089
So we lived together in Korea...

946
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:36,258
and then I went to Australia with them when they went back.

947
00:56:39,198 --> 00:56:41,798
That's why you went to high school in Australia.

948
00:56:43,328 --> 00:56:44,669
Are they good people?

949
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:46,198
I can tell.

950
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:49,738
They're really nice and really funny.

951
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:52,638
They're fun people.

952
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,149
I'm grateful for them.

953
00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:58,419
I should be grateful too.

954
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:01,888
Tell me more.

955
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:03,959
Is there anything I don't know?

956
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:13,758
Actually, I met my mom today.

957
00:57:15,468 --> 00:57:16,569
My birth mom.

958
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:20,169
Your biological mother?

959
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,508
You're in touch with her?

960
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,678
Yes.

961
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:29,109
My Australian parents found her for me.

962
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:30,879
When I was 20.

963
00:57:33,548 --> 00:57:35,419
I'd met her after a long time...

964
00:57:37,189 --> 00:57:39,689
and something upsetting happened.

965
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:46,059
My birth mom is a mom to someone else as well.

966
00:57:47,468 --> 00:57:49,368
(Son)

967
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:04,979
(Mom)

968
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:12,718
(Mom)

969
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,428
(Park Morgan, student)

970
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:28,169
My mom's a professor.

971
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,508
It was a great disguise.

972
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:34,879
So I just felt...

973
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:36,948
a bit upset.

974
00:58:39,548 --> 00:58:43,019
You weren't just upset. You were hurt.

975
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:45,789
It's okay.

976
00:58:46,718 --> 00:58:49,388
Everyone either gets hurt by their parents...

977
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:51,399
or hurts them.

978
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:54,629
Back when I was young,

979
00:58:55,528 --> 00:58:57,198
there was a time when I thought...

980
00:58:57,198 --> 00:59:00,238
that I was forced to be born when I never really asked for it.

981
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:03,209
But if I think about it the other way around,

982
00:59:03,868 --> 00:59:05,778
my mom might've given birth to me...

983
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:08,048
when she didn't really want to.

984
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:12,778
Back then, my existence alone was probably enough to hurt her.

985
00:59:13,778 --> 00:59:15,548
She was only 21.

986
00:59:16,548 --> 00:59:18,519
I'm sure she doesn't think that way anymore.

987
00:59:19,988 --> 00:59:23,129
I liked how you told me...

988
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,229
that you felt sorry for me that day.

989
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:32,169
Ever since I was young, people tried to hide that from me...

990
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:34,339
because they thought they were being polite.

991
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,508
I acted like I didn't notice any of that...

992
00:59:39,738 --> 00:59:41,278
and kept my manners as well.

993
00:59:42,778 --> 00:59:44,879
But you just told me that you felt sorry for me.

994
00:59:47,488 --> 00:59:48,749
And I really liked it.

995
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,559
I'm a pitiful guy, so I'm going to sleep over tonight.

996
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:04,638
Fine, I'll let you sleep over since you're pitiful.

997
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:06,638
I'm going to do more than just sleep.

998
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,238
Isn't that a given?

999
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:14,278
You're so sexy.

1000
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:24,289
- This looks delicious. - Yes.

1001
01:00:30,129 --> 01:00:32,459
- What do you do these days? - I idle away.

1002
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:37,028
We're getting attacked from all sides...

1003
01:00:37,028 --> 01:00:39,569
because we're trying to reform the main page.

1004
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,169
But you seem like you're doing okay.

1005
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,238
I envy you.

1006
01:00:46,078 --> 01:00:47,749
My goodness.

1007
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:50,479
Do you think you're the only one who visits me?

1008
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:52,948
The people who attack you come to see me every day.

1009
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,718
Thanks to you, I'm busier since I left the company.

1010
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,419
Gosh, I need to get my liver checked tomorrow.

1011
01:01:02,089 --> 01:01:03,658
The youngest members of each team are...

1012
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:05,629
asking people to sign a petition to oppose your resignation.

1013
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:07,098
Do you know that?

1014
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:12,069
Yes, of course. People visit me every single day.

1015
01:01:14,968 --> 01:01:16,169
You must be happy.

1016
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:20,738
I envy you for having such a strong fan base.

1017
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,218
That darn fan.

1018
01:01:29,618 --> 01:01:30,919
Well, anyway,

1019
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:34,828
I think it'd be a good idea to add something new...

1020
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:37,598
as we reform the main page.

1021
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:40,428
But I can't think of anything.

1022
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:44,839
Other than reorganizing categories and changing the design,

1023
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:47,368
I want there to be an issue that people can talk about.

1024
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:52,309
Issues always arise at the right timing.

1025
01:01:52,439 --> 01:01:54,249
Around 50 years ago,

1026
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:58,149
you'd be front-page news if you wore a miniskirt.

1027
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:02,319
So in the end, an issue is the middle ground...

1028
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,258
of a particular time and value.

1029
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:07,888
How would you apply that to our business?

1030
01:02:09,658 --> 01:02:12,129
Well, for example,

1031
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:15,798
you could pick what will soon be picked...

1032
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:17,298
in this current time.

1033
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,309
And in reverse, you could discard what will soon be discarded...

1034
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:22,569
in this current time.

1035
01:02:23,138 --> 01:02:26,008
But the crucial part is that you need to do it beforehand.

1036
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:27,879
The right timing.

1037
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:30,309
Timing?

1038
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:33,078
The right timing is eventually what creates an issue.

1039
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,039
What do you mean we exceeded the period of use for the web drama?

1040
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,399
What's the certification of contents for?

1041
01:02:53,638 --> 01:02:55,709
Remember the original work of the web drama...

1042
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:57,238
that you asked us to air when we launched Con TV?

1043
01:02:57,578 --> 01:03:00,209
The agency called and asked us not to air it...

1044
01:03:00,678 --> 01:03:02,109
because the license period expired.

1045
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:05,448
When did it expire?

1046
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:07,749
This April.

1047
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:09,718
And you didn't know that?

1048
01:03:14,428 --> 01:03:16,888
Maybe we should've done more than just suspend you.

1049
01:03:17,388 --> 01:03:19,798
How is this possible? The launch is in less than a month.

1050
01:03:20,928 --> 01:03:22,899
We put in so much effort to cast all those actors...

1051
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,738
so we could enter the South-East Asian market.

1052
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:27,439
If this goes down the drain, it'll be useless to launch it.

1053
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:29,738
I'm sorry. I'll look into what happened.

1054
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:33,479
By the way, Director Bae...

1055
01:03:33,738 --> 01:03:35,809
was the person in charge of this project.

1056
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:41,388
And you were Bae Ta Mi's direct boss.

1057
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:44,919
Ta Mi would never make a mistake like this.

1058
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,488
She definitely would've made sure we had enough time.

1059
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:50,589
You seem to trust her more than you trust yourself.

1060
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:55,468
If there's no written consultation, she would've done it via email.

1061
01:03:55,468 --> 01:03:58,569
How are you going to read her email when she no longer works here?

1062
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:04,709
I'll get her consent so we can read her email.

1063
01:04:06,908 --> 01:04:08,448
Good going.

1064
01:04:08,749 --> 01:04:10,848
You'll have to beg an employee who caused a mess here...

1065
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:12,278
and left to work at Barro.

1066
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:29,899
Yes, I'm at the pub in front of the company building.

1067
01:04:30,569 --> 01:04:32,368
I'll see you here. Let's go together.

1068
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:34,638
Okay, bye.

1069
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:50,189

(Consent form to view contents of intranet email)

1071
01:05:20,618 --> 01:05:21,689
Sign it.

1072
01:05:22,149 --> 01:05:23,589
Why do you need my email?

1073
01:05:26,118 --> 01:05:29,129
The web drama agency sent us a certification of contents...

1074
01:05:30,258 --> 01:05:32,229
saying we exceeded the period of use.

1075
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:34,428
I discussed the term.

1076
01:05:35,069 --> 01:05:36,098
I knew the term was going to end...

1077
01:05:36,129 --> 01:05:38,339
around the time the drama was going to be made.

1078
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:41,638
I figured that could be an issue, so I discussed it via email.

1079
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:43,408
That's why I want you to sign it.

1080
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:45,738
You made us get a certification of contents...

1081
01:05:45,738 --> 01:05:47,749
because you didn't leave a written consultation.

1082
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,048
I added in the contract...

1083
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:55,749
that we could discuss the terms via email or written consultation...

1084
01:05:55,749 --> 01:05:57,959
if there's a legitimate reason behind it.

1085
01:05:59,218 --> 01:06:01,859
Are you saying it's a problem that I discussed it via email?

1086
01:06:02,028 --> 01:06:04,428
The problem is that you made me come here for something like this.

1087
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:06,059
Don't you get it?

1088
01:06:06,328 --> 01:06:09,828
Don't you know how sick I am of all the troubles you cause?

1089
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,638
Is this seriously my fault?

1090
01:06:12,698 --> 01:06:14,069
This isn't my fault.

1091
01:06:14,468 --> 01:06:16,209
The agency's trying to mess with Unicon.

1092
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:18,579
You must've done something to make them want to do that.

1093
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:31,088
You left without even saying goodbye to our subcontractors...

1094
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,989
just because you got fired.

1095
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:36,059
Do you think this is the only issue you caused...

1096
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:38,128
- by leaving without a transition? - You need to bear with that...

1097
01:06:38,758 --> 01:06:40,059
since I was dismissed unfairly.

1098
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:49,338
And shouldn't you be asking me to sign the agreement...

1099
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:51,008
instead of ordering me to do it?

1100
01:06:52,038 --> 01:06:53,809
You're here to ask me for a favor.

1101
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:58,548
Why are you so angry when you're asking me for a favor?

1102
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:01,288
You were never this emotional.

1103
01:07:02,649 --> 01:07:04,288
At least that's how I remember.

1104
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:07,059
What do you even know...

1105
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:09,029
about me?

1106
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,498
Do you want to criticize me and tell me that I've changed?

1107
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,729
Do you want me to go back to how I used to be?

1108
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:16,168
- I just want... - Why do you always...

1109
01:07:16,168 --> 01:07:18,138
cling onto me as if we had a special relationship?

1110
01:07:28,008 --> 01:07:29,309
Do you think...

1111
01:07:31,149 --> 01:07:32,479
you've changed?

1112
01:08:01,848 --> 01:08:02,909
I'm scared...

1113
01:08:04,779 --> 01:08:07,619
that this might've been your true self all along.

1114
01:09:21,388 --> 01:09:23,859
I need to hand it in right now, but how am I going to do that?

1115
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,458
But was it really my fault?

1116
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,729
You wouldn't have dropped it if you had been more careful.

1117
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:31,298
You wouldn't have stepped on it if you had been more careful.

1118
01:09:31,298 --> 01:09:32,998
Hey, what's your problem?

1119
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,979
Why are you taking it out on her...

1120
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,409
when you're the one who dropped it?

1121
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:42,848
Look at how bad your painting is.

1122
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,208
I guess you're here to slack off.

1123
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:45,949
You shouldn't even call this a painting.

1124
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,848
What? What did you just say?

1125
01:09:49,388 --> 01:09:50,519
Let's go, Ga Gyeong.

1126
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:53,159
So much for that cute face of yours.

(Search: WWW)

1130
01:10:50,678 --> 01:10:52,418
Just how much did you like me?

1131
01:10:52,418 --> 01:10:54,718
Now I want to know how much you hate me.

1132
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:56,619
CEO Na of Unicon and the Vice-president of Barro...

1133
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,519
are meeting Chairwoman Jang for a meal.

1134
01:10:58,519 --> 01:10:59,588
What will you do now?

1135
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,989
What is it you can do?

1136
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,359
Fans are supposed to watch from afar.

1137
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,059
So you're just my fan?

1138
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:08,029
Why don't you ask Da In to play the song this time?

1139
01:11:08,029 --> 01:11:10,199
- Aren't you going to get married? - I want to,

1140
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:11,968
but that's not up to just me.

1141
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:14,498
He's my first love.
